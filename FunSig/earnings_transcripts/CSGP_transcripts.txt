Andrew Florance: Good day and thank you for joining CoStar Group's first quarter 2025 earnings call. We posted another strong quarter with Q1 '25 revenue coming in at $732 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. This was our 56th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Q1 revenue exceeded consensus and was at the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA was $66 million, a 429% increase of Q1 over Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA also exceeded consensus and was at the top end of our guidance range. We achieved a very strong 43% profit margin in our Q1 '25 commercial real estate and information marketplace businesses that includes CoStar, Apartments, LoopNet, STR Real Estate Manager, Land and BizBuysell in aggregate, coming at a 43% profit margin. Company net new bookings were $56 million in the first quarter of '25, up 6% sequentially from the fourth quarter of '24. Our international businesses have achieved 3 consecutive quarters of all-time net new bookings, reaching over $5 million ARR in Q1 '25, representing 56% year-over-year growth. We had 130 million average unique visitors to our global websites in Q1 '25 according to Google Analytics. CoStar achieved $265 million in revenue in Q1 '25. Revenue was up 6% year-over-year, while annualized net new bookings reached their highest level since Q3 '23, generating 68% year-over-year growth. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing net new bookings as we continue to generate strong sales with banks, institutional investors and owners. STR's integration to CoStar contributed to its best quarter ever for net new bookings, up 17% year-over-year. This increase was driven by significant rise in sales to owner operators who were 40% of STR's net new bookings in Q1. We grew the number of CoStar subscribers in Q1 17% year-over-year, largely driven by the migration of STR to the CoStar platform. CoStar for lenders led by Mr. John Vecchione achieved its best ever quarter of net new bookings, up 116% year-over-year. Today, lender is used by 385 institutions to manage risk on $1 trillion of CRE debt. In less than 3 years, it has achieved $80 million in annual revenue run rate. We have several product enhancements that will roll out in the course of the next few years that can take the total addressable market for lender well above $1 billion. CoStar remains a mission-critical tool for our clients across all segments. Log-ins to CoStar were up 21% year-over-year and our subscribers averaged 100 million activities each month, the highest level of activity in the past 9 quarters. Our quarterly renewal rate remains strong at 92%. During the past few years and through today, we're operating in one of the worst commercial real estate environments in decades. Looking at investment-grade office, although absorption is improving, we are still seeing historic high vacancy rate of about 16%. Real asking rents of $36.64 sit at a 30-year low. Real sales price per square foot is a decade low of $257 per square foot. Market cap rates are at a high point of 9.17%. Sales volume, while recovering is about 1/3 of normal levels. In industrial, we're seeing record lows for absorption and a 6% year-over-year decline in real asking rents. In retail, real asking rents are 10-year lows. But I want to be clear, we see clear signs that the cycle is improving. Vacancy rates have hit their [indiscernible] and are beginning to fall. Availability rates have fallen 60 basis points. Sublet rents are beginning to rise. We expect that as market conditions improve over the next few years, the headwinds we've experienced will shift to tailwinds and CoStar will return to double-digit growth. LoopNet turned in an outstanding quarter as annualized net new bookings skyrocketed 200% year-over-year. This was LoopNet's highest quarter of annualized net new bookings since Q3 '22. In the quarter, per rep productivity was twice as high as Q1 '24. This great sales performance was a result of changing our go-to-market sales strategy. Our sales team is focused on selling a broad subscription package to owners and brokers to get all their properties on the platform rather than focusing on selling a few high-value signature ads that only address a small portion of the portfolio. Tenants begin their search online and LoopNet is the largest commercial estate marketplace in the world. So it's far more valuable to the owner to have exposure for all their properties rather than have robust exposure for 1 or 2 of their properties. This strategy will grow the number of paid properties on the platform which increases the choice available on LoopNet for consumers and gives our sales team the opportunity to upsell silver ads to Signature depth ads in the future. We're now also implementing asset-based pricing as silver ads come up for renewal. Our renewal rates on these ads remain strong at 97% as our customers understand it is important to tie the price of any given LoopNet add [ph] to the value of the property being advertised. Our pricing will reflect that $1 billion 5-star office building in Manhattan derives more value from LoopNet than does a $100,000 2-star retail building in Montana. Ultimately, it's our goal to implement asset-based pricing across all ad tiers on both new sales and renewals. CoStar Real Estate Manager and Visual Lease attained annualized subscription revenue growth nearing double digits. In Q1 2025, we moved forward with the consolidation of leadership and operations across the brands, positioning the leases businesses for integration in the greater CoStar data offering. This, combined with other identified cost savings resulted in 50% year-over-year EBITDA growth for the combined brands. Both brands continue to take market share from lease management competitors, many of whom are falling short on product innovation and focus on customers. The leases product team is now focused on combine the value of its portfolio management applications with CoStar's data and analytics, Matterport and LoopNet offerings to create an unrivaled solution for occupiers for real estate. CoStar continues to develop a data set of leases from both anonymized customer data from the leased brands and publicly available sources like the SEC and U.K. land registry with the goal of providing full transparency on rent concessions and tenant improvements to real estate professionals. Q1 brought additional growth of customers electing to share data on an aggregated and anonymized basis. For the quarter, Land.com net new bookings increased 58%. Land.com continues integrating with Homes.com. Today, over 8,000 Homes.com members are syndicating over 22,000 applicable listings to Land.com. Soon, Land.com members will receive a similar benefit on Homes.com, increasing value and opportunities for both sites. In mid-March, Farmer Mac released the Farmer Mac Farmland Price Index powered by our recently acquired AcreValue. Farmer Mac said the introduction of the FPI marks a significant advancement in tracking farmland price trends with greater precision and timeliness. We agree and look forward to providing greater, more timely insight into farmland markets. BizBuySell revenue reached $8.7 million in the first quarter, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Net new bookings increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both business owner and business buyer subscriptions. Subscription revenue from BizBuySell Edge which offers entrepreneurs advanced tools and market insights grew 48% year-over-year. Buyer demand continues to strengthen with website visits up 22% and lead volume increasing 33% year-over-year. Apartments.com turned in another strong quarter with revenue of $282 million, an increase of 11% over Q1 '24. Apartments.com sales team was very active in the first quarter. They conducted over 166,000 quality interactions with clients and prospects in the quarter and increased their face-to-face meetings by 65% year-over-year. The increase in quality interactions is paying off as we added 4,300 new communities in Q1, the most properties we've added to Apartments.com in a single quarter in almost 10 years. We're benefiting from the shutdown of Redfin of their rent period business as we target those properties that were formerly on rent period, not apartments. We launched marketing campaigns to owners, specifically comparing our traffic, leads and leases to rent period with face-to-face follow-up with these communities with much success. We now have 80,000 multifamilies on Apartments.com. The sales team maintained a 94 Net Promoter Score during the quarter. We see a $2.6 billion opportunity in the 20-unit and above building space and is our intention to grow the sales team 23% this year to keep up with this potential. Since 2019, we've grown apartments revenue 118% but only grown our sales reps in production by 56%. So we'll continue to accelerate our sales force growth to keep up with this opportunity. We've added 56 sales professionals so far this year with an additional 24 sales professionals that started training this week. I'm especially excited to welcome our 37 new sales team members that have come to us from Rent period. I believe that we have added more salespeople from rent period than Zillow did despite Zillow spending a lot of money to acquire assets from Redfin. These individuals average 10 years of multifamily sales experience and are already producing good results. Our 2025 Apartments.com marketing campaign is in full swing and features the most content we've ever developed to reach the largest audience possible. In Q1, our 5 new TV spots were featured in March Madness, the National Women's Soccer League. And for NFL fans, you probably saw us last week on the NFL draft. Our campaign will also be featured throughout other profile shows and during the Major League Baseball, NHL and NBA seasons. We have increased our paid search efforts in the first quarter and will continue to do so throughout the year to attract more potential renters to our advertisers' communities by generating 5x more number 1 positions than Zillow in the top 50 U.S. rental markets. Our unaided awareness among apartment seekers remains higher than all of our competitors combined at 65% and our closest competitor is 30 percentage points below us. Among industry professionals, our unaided brand awareness is now at an all-time high of 86%, a 26% increase over 2024. Industry professionals tell us that delivering high-quality leads to convert to more leases is the most important thing we do. In 2025, brand study, a brand study conducted by GovX [ph], 47% of owners and operators surveyed said Apartments.com had a completely or very effective lead-to-lease conversion rate that's 38% more than Zillow's and 160% more than rent periods. The Apartments.com network had 38 million average monthly unique visitors in the first quarter, comScore has released their March data and has us ahead of Zillow in visits in March by 5% with 90 million visits and has the apartments network up 7% year-over-year for the first quarter, while Zillow is showing down 27% for the same period. Very importantly, our lead flow to our customers continues to increase and is up 17% year-over-year. According to the most recent analysis by Entrata [ph] through March of this year, apartments delivered 1.8x more leads than other rental networks. Apartments.com also delivers by far the highest quality of leads converting 2.7x better than other rental networks and ultimately delivers more leases than other rental networks, 5.1x more to be exact. Our Apply now leads, our highest converting lead type, are up 814% over Q1 of last year as more and more properties enable this feature. In the first quarter, we added a record of high of 142,000 single-family rentals posted on the platform and assisted our independent owner clients by collecting $1.4 billion in rental payments. We continue to see success from the utilization of Matterport on our rental sites with potential renters viewing Matterport's 53 million times in the quarter, up 59% year-over-year, while spending 71% more time on listings detail pages with the Matterport. Apartments.com is also benefiting from the increased traffic on Homes.com as Apartments.com paid advertisers also get exposure over Homes.com's rental area. Apartments.com Canada revenue grew 350% year-over-year with all-time highs in March for visitors, visits and leads. According to recent data from DashIQ [ph], Apartments.com now delivers more leads and leases than any other ILS in Canada. 14 months ago, CoStar Group launched the new Homes.com with a marketing blitz at Super Bowl 58. The new Homes.com offers a completely different business model than do competing U.S. residential portals in the U.S. The new Homes.com is based on the premise that the most important thing a portal can do is to market a property for sale. This is in harmony with all the most successful and highly profitable portals around the world outside the U.S. which are all based upon this market the property, not an agent lead gen business model. The legacy competing unprofitable U.S. property portals are based upon lead diversion business models. These lead diversion models divert leads from the potential homebuyers away from the listing agent and into the hands of a buyer agent willing to split their commission with a portal. Our research shows that these lead diversion models are very unpopular with home sellers, buyers and agents. These lead diversion sites are not designed to solve for the most important task which is to sell the home. The new Homes.com is a clean, fast site offering a wealth of valuable content on neighboring schools that home shoppers cannot find on competing sites. Based upon a wealth of consumer and agent feedback, we believe that Homes.com offers a vastly superior user experience and is preferred by home shoppers. To build a massive audience for home sellers and listing agents, we launched one of the largest marketing campaigns ever in real estate. Using RPA, the same firm we successfully used to create the Apartments.com brand, we recruited talent like Dan Levy, Heidi Gardner, Morgan Freeman, Lil Wayne and Jeff Goldblum to create memorable and effective spots for the new Homes.com. We have run 32,000 commercials and digital placements, generating approximately 80 billion impressions. In Q1 alone, we generated 6 billion brand impressions across many of the biggest events in America, including the Super Bowl, the College Football Championship and March Madness. To be successful, Homes.com -- for Homes.com to be successful, home shoppers need to be aware of Homes.com and have intention to use it. Our target audience of several hundred million home shoppers is massive. Before we launched in February '24, only 4% of that target audience when asked top of mind what home shopping websites can you think of replied Homes.com. In 14 months of marketing campaign, we have steadily increased our unaided awareness 9x to 36%. So we're now at 36% unaided awareness. Early last year, our unaided awareness surpassed Trulia. Last summer, we surpassed Redfin's unaided awareness. And last month, we crossed Realtor.com. When we began, Zillow was 64 points above our unaided awareness. We've closed the gap to 24 points and are still improving. Our unaided intention or the percentage of people surveyed that say they intend to use our site has grown from single digit to 26%. We've also crossed Realtor, Redfin and Trulia on unaided intent. Zillow and Realtor have been trending down while we've been growing. I have consistently set the expectation of building a B2C brand takes 3 to 5 years. To reach this level of unaided awareness and unaided intent in an audience of hundreds of millions in 14 months is excellent progress. I feel that over the next 2 to 4 years, we can take a solid and very valuable leadership position in the industry. With a superior product and aggressive marketing campaign and both growing unaided awareness and intent, we're seeing very strong audience and traffic growth in the Homes.com network. In just 14 months, we built a Q1 '24 audience of 104 million average monthly unique visitors. That's according to Google Analytics. This now makes the Homes.com network one of the top 2 residential portals based upon monthly unique visitors according to the latest available public securities filings of our peer portals or near peer portals. We remain well ahead of Redfin and Realtor.com's traffic. With such a wide lead over these 2, we've shifted our traffic acquisition strategy away from pure volume to targeting quality engaged traffic. Our bounce rate has improved 45 percentage points. Our session duration is up 200% and the number of page visits per visit has more than doubled. We're monetizing Homes.com by selling memberships to agents giving their listings priority placements on Homes.com which brings more buyer views, more leads and on average enables them to sell the property faster and for more money. Members listings sort to the top of their market generally to the first page where 90% of all buyers click through to listings. We present their listings with our neighbor of the school content on competing listings and suggestion e-mails on our home page. With 1 billion visits to Homes.com in the past 12 months, we have unique insight who's in the market to buy a new home. We retarget members' listings across thousands of websites to keep their listings top of mind. We also provide members with a Matterport and floor plan for their listings so that potential buyers can tour their listings 24/7. It is a comprehensive digital real estate marketing package no one else is offering. In a time where home sales are getting a little tougher to achieve, I think we're well positioned and in the right place at the right time of the cycle. One of the most important events for a real estate agent is the listing presentation where they meet with a home seller and try to win a listing to sell their home. Homes.com members use the marketing benefits we offer through membership to differentiate themselves from competing agents and win more listing presentations. We track the listing win rate advantage for members closely and it's steadily climbing and now member agents are winning 61% more listings than before membership. Since the average value of winning a new listing is $15,000 and monthly membership fee is less than $500, the ROI is outstanding. Last February, when we launched the new Homes.com, we faced several hurdles. At launch, we only had a very small dedicated Homes.com sales force of about 50 reps to sell to more than 1 million agents. We were offering a completely new value proposition to an agent customer base with very negative feelings about the business models of legacy real estate portals in our space. There was a bit of undeserved guilt by association. Last May, just after launch, our first Net Promoter Score was disappointing at negative 42. Many early members did not understand our new value proposition and believe that Homes.com like Zillow was a lead diversion site and were disappointed we were not diverting other agents leads to them to generate buyer agency business. That had never been our intent. Our out-of-cycle early cancellation rate or failed payment at the time was high at 10% monthly. By late summer to early fall '24, our value proposition was better understood and our NPS turned positive and moved into the good classification in the low single digits. And our early cancellation dropped significantly to 6%. In the last few months, our Net Promoter Scores have been surging upwards and have reached 43 which is at the great classification and our early cancel or failed payment rate has dropped to between 0.25 point and 2.5% per month, great progress. Since we launched a completely new product concept in the U.S. in February '24, the early cancellation rate on 12-month contracts has plummeted at 65%. Since last May, our Net Promoter Score has soared over 85 points to sit in the great classification. Under the very strong leadership of our Senior Vice President of Sales, Andy Stearns, we have grown that small initial team of 50 dedicated sales reps, 600% over the last 14 months to 314 reps in production. Those reps with 4 months of production are turning in a steady 1,612 monthly net new revenue which implies our straight lines to $232,000 in billings per average rep at the end of 12 months or $1.1 million billings per rep at the end of 5 years of accounting. The sales force is still growing very rapidly with 64 more in training and with offers out to an additional 214 salespeople. In Q4, we anticipate we'll have 500 salespeople with 4 months of experience selling Homes.com. That would suggest we could be adding over $800,000 a month new billing each month by Q4. We have recently optimized our pricing strategy to better align the price of our product with the stronger benefits listing agents and rental agents receive as Homes.com members. The first iteration of our pricing strategy determined membership price based on equal weighting of buyer and seller agency deals. Now we largely price based on seller listings. In April, month-to-date, our demo to close rate is 56%. So something is going right there. This is the highest monthly close rate I've ever seen for any CoStar brand. With 1 day left in April, the dedicated Homes.com sales team is currently positioned to close 240,000 monthly net new bookings. They're still selling past some of the sales from the prior year that the general sales force did but they're solidly into positive territory. This is the dedicated sales team's best net new bookings month to date and a $420,000 positive swing from the prior month. With improving NPS scores, our projected cancellations for May are falling approximately 70%. At the same time, our gross sales are climbing as we bring on more salespeople and they gain experience. I believe that by year-end, our Homes.com sales team will be our largest and will be turning in the most net new revenue of any CoStar Group -- any product area in CoStar Group with regular 1 million net new months for Homes.com. We recently released a new purchase option for Homes.com called Boost which is a marketing option for a single listing. For agents with unpredictable income and not yet ready to commit to an annual membership, they can boost one listing via e-commerce. Just like membership, once boosted, their listing source at the top of search results, receives a Matterport and is retargeted across the Internet. This is a low-risk purchase option for an agent because they can go into a listing presentation, use the Boost as a differentiator but they only have to pay for it when they win the listing and have offsetting commission revenue. From our perspective, Boost is a great way for agents to get their foot in the door and we will be funneling Boost purchases as leads into our sales team to call upon for upsales to membership. We're also offering the Boost option directly to home sellers. These are home sellers with agents but often home sellers want -- we've seen in Australia, it's really successful where home sellers regularly add marketing tailwinds to their home for sale, purchasing tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of Boost from portals to market their home for sale online. We tested the Boost option with home sellers and listing agents and focus groups in Southern California recently. The feedback was universally positive with almost all participants saying they would purchase a boost for their home or listing at about the $500 price point. In July, we expect to launch a new Homes Homes.com marketing offering for homebuilders. This is an attractive market for us to enter because new construction represents approximately 20% of all homes sold in a given year, yet there's no great single place for consumer to go and find all the available new communities. Building a site with full inventory of available new homes would be a very valuable option for both consumers and the industry and it would allow Homes.com to capture a piece of the estimated $3 billion annual marketing spend by America's homebuilders. We've already secured listing feeds representing 60% of the total available inventory and I expect this number will grow as we approach July. Initial feedback from builders has been overwhelmingly positive as we meet with them, builders tell us they're thrilled that a portal is finally delivering a beautifully designed, robust new home search experience. We are carefully controlling expenses generally and with Homes.com specifically. In the first quarter, we realized over $50 million in annualized savings, mostly through cost reduction initiatives in our Homes.com investment. Overall, we reduced headcount in the company by 423 in Q1. Zillow recently announced an aggressive new policy of permanently banning homes that have been privately marketed for over 24 hours, pretty aggressive. With the post-NAR lawsuit, industry changes around clear cooperation, no co-mingling rules, I believe that our diversion competitors are getting anxious that brokers with more choice may increasingly choose to market their properties away from those lead diversion platforms. The home is not listed on Zillow, Zillow lose the opportunity to use the listing to sell the buyer agency leads and take 40% of the buyer agent commission. We're still for them is that if more and more listing agents stay off their platforms and the listing count will fall and they could lose audience and fall into a downward spiral. We view this move not only as anticompetitive but also shows a bit of desperation. I authored an open letter last week to the industry, making sure anyone -- everyone was watching the power grab Zillow was attempting. My communication surprisingly reached an estimated 50 million impressions across e-mail, LinkedIn and earned media coverage. The reaction from agents was approximately 10:1 positive to us. In those most recent focus groups, one agent said, well, everyone hate Zillow, buyers, sellers, agents and brokers. The word that many use describe Zillow's predatory. The decades of mistreatment, agents are desperate for a viable alternative and they now have one Homes.com. My favorite quote the evening was Homes.com brings us a lot and they're going to surpass Zillow very soon. The moderator asked where they're hearing that and the agent replied by saying, "God, everyone at my brokerage meetings, lawyers, brokers, commercial agents, everyone". At the end of the 1-year mark as we kicked off our sales efforts, I'm confident that Homes.com is a winning product. We're seeing excellent momentum in sales. If you look around the world at successful real estate portals that use our business model of marketing the real estate, not lead diversion, the EBITDA opportunity is really impressive. The EBITDA normalized to the size of the U.S. GDP of market leaders like REA Group, Scout, Rightmove, Domain, Hemnet and Idealista [ph] for the United States ranges between $1 billion of potential EBITDA to $9 billion of potential EBITDA in the U.S., suggesting that, that residential portal opportunity in the United States is a lot larger than the $79 million adjusted EBITDA number one of our competitors turned in, in 2024, about 100x larger than that. On the market head over the United Kingdom had another strong quarter, 11 straight months, we've seen net new bookings growth equivalent to $7.2 million annualized revenue. We are delivering fantastic ROI to agents who subscribe on the market. Lead volume increased 17% year-over-year. We increased listings by 23% year-over-year. The audience is engaged as we saw page views and time on site grow by 99% and 81%, respectively, year-over-year. In February 2025, we made an all-cash offer for Domain Holdings, one of Australia's 2 largest real estate portals and one of the 10 largest real estate marketplaces in the world. Domain is very profitable, growing and is in the market -- in a market with great dynamics for real estate portals with vendor or owner paid models. 2024 annual revenue was $250 million in using today's conversion rate and EBITDA of $88 million. Australia's real estate portals use the vendor paid advertising model, unlike the competing U.S. portals which have lead gen miles for buyer agents. Australian portals generate revenue through marketing and real estate. Home sellers are regularly paying companies like Domain and REA anywhere from $3,000 on up to $50,000 to market their home for sale online and those AUD 5,000, AUD 50,000. One element Domain -- one element that -- from Domain that will benefit Homes.com and on the market is depth advertising. Similar to signature ads for Apartments.com and LoopNet, Domain offers 4 tiers of advertising that offer increasing levels of exposure as you move up their ad tiers by utilizing sort order, larger search blockers, social amplification and retargeting. We will be adopting the best practices of Domain in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom. We see numerous opportunities to create additional value for Domain following the potential acquisition. Domain's majority owner today is a media business which historically underinvested in the product. Simultaneously, REA Group's market dominance is not incentivized to innovate and improve their product. Both sites [indiscernible] comparison to the product we built with Homes.com. We will bring what we've built in Homes.com to Australia and the United Kingdom to win over consumers. Domain is also a strong entry point into Australia's commercial real estate market. They operate commercialrealestate.com.au, a top 2 CRE marketplace in Australia with thousands of listings we can migrate into LoopNet. Adding Australian listings to LoopNet would provide great value to multinational owners and brokers that list on LoopNet and the multinational tenants that are searching the site. Domain's inventory commercial listings lays a strong foundation for building CoStar covering Australia. The Board of Domain is a majority shareholder, Nine Entertainment has backed our offer and we're in the process of conducting due diligence. Of course, there is no guarantee that our proposal will result in a transaction. We closed the acquisition of Matterport at the end of February and we have been long-time users of Matterport and I'm very excited to have the opportunity to work with RJ, Gausebeck and the entire Matterport team on the next phase of their impressive journey. The Matterport technology will be an incredible asset for us. They have an impressive product road map which will benefit our entire ecosystem. At the end of March, Matterport had created digital twins for an astounding 54 billion square feet of space. Over the past 4 years, Matterport has increased total spaces under management by more than 20% annual and total square footage by over 30% each year. Our new goal is to reach trillion square feet of digital twins. That requires 35% year-over-year growth. Their sales success was achieved with a small sales team but mighty at 47. We plan to grow both their R&D and sales team. With Matterport technology combined with CoStar's global scale and reach, the future is bright for both companies. I want to close by doing something important, thanking our Board members, Mike Klein, Chris Nassetta and -- who are concluding their service on the CoStar Board. Through the years, they have offered excellent counsel and have been extremely valuable in helping us build CoStar Group into the global organization it is operating in 192 countries with a $34 billion market cap. Mike Klein and David Bonderman and I -- they cofounded the business with me in 1987. I still marvel at Mike Klein Mortgaging his house to invest most all of his net worth or maybe 150% of his net worth into a 22-year-old start-up concept. Turns out he was a genius, he is a visionary and his support and counsel was matchless. As part of the ongoing refreshment of our Board, we made some important announcements earlier this month. Louise Sams, who's been a CoStar Board member since 2019 has been named Chair of the Board. She has strong international and legal experience having served as EVP and General Counsel of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. for nearly 2 decades and President for nearly a decade. Louise is currently the Board Chair of Princeton University which I hear is a good place. She has been an impactful Board member and is the perfect person to chair our Board. I'm looking forward to working with John Berisford, Rachel Glaser and Christine McCarthy. They bring a wealth of business experience with strong track records at leading global companies. Christine is a recognized corporate finance leader with over 30 years of experience, most recently as CFO of the Walt Disney Company. John is an accomplished executive who most recently served as President of S&P Global Ratings. Rachel has extensive market experience as the former CFO of Etsy and direct residential industry experience as the former CFO of Move, Inc. I'll be chairing our new Board's Capital Allocation Committee and John, Christine and Robert Musslewhite will also serve on the committee. The Board established the committee to review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the company's capital structure, capital allocation priorities and financial targets. The committee's review will also focus on operating performance, including the setting of near-term, long-term financial targets for resource and capital allocation. The committee's charges to continue the company's outstanding capital allocation track record has resulted in the company's outperforming 98% of the NASDAQ companies since our IPO. And with my very brief remarks, I'm going to turn it over to Chris Lown.
Christian Lown: Thank you, Andy. First quarter 2025 revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $732 million. Matterport contributed $15.9 million of revenue for the quarter which represented 1 month of activity. Excluding the Matterport contribution, revenue was at the high end of our guidance and above consensus estimates. First quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at $66 million and a 9% margin, also exceeding consensus and the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to timing of marketing spend, lower personnel costs from cost-saving initiatives and hiring timing. Matterport contributed an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.7 million for the first quarter stub period. Our commercial information and marketplace brands delivered healthy 43% profit margins in the first quarter. This measure does not include our investments in Homes.com, on the Market and Matterport. CoStar revenue grew 6% in the first quarter, in line with our guidance. Even considering what continues to be a difficult commercial real estate backdrop, CoStar net new bookings continue to improve and are now at the highest levels since the third quarter of 2023. While we do not anticipate some -- I'm sorry, while we do anticipate some slight headwinds from government contract cancellations expected throughout 2025, we still expect CoStar revenue growth to remain at 6% in the second quarter and we are maintaining our 6% to 7% revenue growth guidance for the full year. Apartments.com revenue grew 11% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. We refocused our sales plans this year to emphasize new rooftops and we are seeing the benefits of this incentive structure with a considerable growth in our number of listed properties. The under 100-unit property cohort increased 19% year-over-year in the quarter. This addressable market is nearly 4x the size of the over 100-unit property cohort. We expect to continue to penetrate the sub-100 property segment. And as such, we are maintaining our full year 2025 Apartments.com revenue guidance of 11% to 12%. For 2Q 2025, we expect multifamily revenue growth of 10%. LoopNet revenue grew 5% in the first quarter, also in line with our guidance. Importantly, we are building great momentum at LoopNet as it delivered its highest net new bookings quarter in nearly 3 years. We expect revenue growth to accelerate throughout the year with 7% growth expected in the second quarter of 2025. We are increasing our guidance expectations for 2Q for 2025 and now expect revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the full year as growth accelerates throughout the year. Revenue from Information Services was $40 million in the first quarter. Revenue growth for the second quarter and full year is expected to be in the 18% to 20% range. Visual Lease's integration with Real Estate Manager is well underway and we're extremely excited about the lease benchmarking product and expect the beta launch by year-end. Other revenue which now includes Matterport, was $45 million for the first quarter, with Matterport contributing $15.9 million. We expect other second quarter revenue of approximately $70 million with Matterport revenue of approximately $40 million. We expect full year revenue to increase by 100% to 115% to $270 million to $280 million, with Matterport contributing $135 million to $140 million. Residential revenue was $27 million in the first quarter. First quarter sales reflected the nature of cancellations from our initial first quarter 2024 Homes.com sales and we expect net new bookings to increase throughout the year. This will result in meaningful revenue growth acceleration throughout the second half of 2025. Our 2025 residential revenue growth outlook remains in the mid-teens to low 20s percent range and we expect second quarter revenue growth in the low single digits due to the impact of first quarter cancellations. In just one short year, we have rapidly increased Homes.com's unaided brand awareness ninefold to 36 and have become the second most visited U.S. residential portal. As we continue to scale the Homes.com dedicated sales force, we expect revenue growth to accelerate into 2026 and beyond and are excited about what could be CoStar's largest business. For the first quarter, CoStar posted a $15 million net loss due primarily to the onetime costs from closing the Matterport acquisition. We earned $38.5 million of net investment income on our $3.8 billion in cash in the first quarter or a 4.1% net yield. We are making great progress on increasing our sales forces which totaled 1,600 salespeople at end March. While much of the increase was concentrated in Homes.com, we are ahead of our sales headcount hiring plan across all of our brands. Our contract renewal rate was 89% in the first quarter of 2025 and remains strong at 94% for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% of total revenue for the first quarter of 2025. Net new bookings for the first quarter were $56 million, representing a sequential increase of 6% from the fourth quarter and a 29% increase from the third quarter of 2024. Absent the onetime headwinds from Homes.com cancellations in the first quarter, net new bookings would have been $60 million. Commercial net new bookings increased 14% year-over-year and 19% from the fourth quarter, coming in higher than any quarter in 2024. During the first quarter of 2025, CoStar Group repurchased 240,000 shares for an aggregate cost of $18.5 million. We still anticipate repurchasing $150 million of shares in total in 2025. On March 27, CoStar provided a nonbinding indicative offer to acquire Domain Group for AUD 4.43 per share. As part of this effort, we acquired 107 million shares at an average cost of AUD 4.22 or approximately USD 290 million. We now own 16.9% of Domain's outstanding shares are in the process of performing due diligence and recently received a 2-week extension to complete our due diligence by May 12. For the full year of 2025, we expect revenue of $3.115 billion to $3.155 billion, implying an annual growth rate of 14% to 15%. This forecast is broadly in line with our original 2025 guidance and includes a 4 to 5 percentage point contribution from the Matterport acquisition. Second quarter 2025 revenue is expected in the $770 million to $775 million range, representing 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. 2025 adjusted EBITDA is now expected in the range of $355 million to $385 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 12%. The inclusion of Matterport is anticipated to reduce our adjusted 2025 EBITDA forecast by approximately $30 million. So excluding Matterport, we remain broadly in line to slightly above our original 2025 guidance. Second quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $50 million to $60 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 7%. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan.
Alexei Gogolev: Andy, great to hear from you. Thank you for the introduction. And I was wondering if you had any additional comments on the delayed market listing exemption that was discussed by the NAR and then the reaction from Zillow. Have you had a chance to speak to brokerage firms? What is their view on the Zillow's and [indiscernible] reactions?
Andrew Florance: What I've heard is overwhelmingly negative. So I've heard, read hundreds of comments from agents. And again, I'd say 90-some percent negative. So there's a pretty transparent thought there that they're requiring people to put their listings up early in order to make sure that they have a chance to monetize them and people aren't taking their listings to market without going through Zillow first. And I think that is sort of a surprising over sort of act that probably I think, shows a little bit of weakness. But I think it's being confused a little bit with something related to COMPASS. I don't think it is. It is unusual to see something the NAR is allowing having a portal trying to set a new set of rules. So create a good opportunity for us for sure.
Alexei Gogolev: And Chris, a quick follow-up on your guidance. Would you be able to tell us what was the nonresidential EBITDA margin in Q1? And if your outlook for resi spend for 2025 is still intact?
Christian Lown: Yes. So the commercial margin was 43% for the first quarter. And as Andy mentioned our...
Andrew Florance: Chris, that's impressive.
Christian Lown: It's pretty good margin. And as Andy mentioned, we have been very focused on expenses around Homes.com. A lot of our actions taken in the first quarter to manage and reduce costs did come out of Homes.com. So we are very much on track from a budget perspective around the numbers we've discussed historically for Homes.com. No change there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi.
Peter Christiansen: Good progress on a number of fronts here. Andy and congratulations on closing Matterport. Can you walk us through the next 12, 18 months, if we could just double-click on how you envision Matterport being integrated into the CoStar platform and how you think about monetization of that product? And just curious on how do you think that Matterport evolves with CoStar over the next 12 to 18 months.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So Matterport is going to have 2 different lives. One is it's being very broadly used around the world by construction companies, brokers, agents, developers, boat dealers, airplane manufacturers, anyone trying to digitize a space. And then it will be more deeply embedded into all of our platforms from real estate manager to CoStar to LoopNet to apartments to homes to hopefully Domain one day. And we will be embedding it deeply natively and building unique and special features in those product areas that makes a Matterport available with more power in those spaces. I've had a chance to meet a lot of the Matterport folks. I would say that they and I have real -- a common vision for some exciting R&D projects that I think will add a lot of value. I believe R&D -- I believe Matterport is on the verge of producing some pretty interesting things in their technology. They'll have a lot of applications, both for our platforms and outside our platforms. I think that I'm really amazed at how ubiquitous the value prop is for Matterport. I'm just recently touring some construction over in Europe and they've been Matterport in the construction site every week. Matterport up until recently has only had about 5 salespeople to cover Europe, Asia, Africa, all the world ex the United States. Clearly -- and I figure that those 5 salespeople had 1.3 million good prospects per salesperson. So I think there's a wonderful opportunity to invest in both the R&D side, the sales side and grow significant revenue for Matterport, build it to a good margin and then also fund more aggressive R&D within the product.
Christian Lown: Yes. I'd expand on that a little bit and also add from a practical perspective, it will inevitably lower cancellations and products, right? As people have more time on site, they use it more. We hear people renting apartments with Matterports without going physically there. People looking for commercial real estate will travel less and therefore, we will spend more time on site and will become more ubiquitous. So we think really we believe real financial tailwinds will accrue as well as we, as Andy said, really deeply embed this application across all of our platforms which will just strengthen their outcomes but also their financial outcomes as well.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: You mentioned realizing about $50 million in residential savings in the quarter. Can you talk about how you're thinking about investment spend for this year in light of the work that the capital allocation committee is doing on the Board? How are you thinking about the $900 million and change originally targeted for the year?
Christian Lown: Yes. The $900 million investment is unchanged. The $500 million was really a capital allocation, a proactive capital allocation decision we made to take some costs out of Homes.com and shift them towards the sales force. As was mentioned, our sales force growth is exceeding our expectations which was fantastic but we're able to make capital allocation decisions to move costs from one place and invest that capital elsewhere. And so it's in line with plan and there are no changes.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens.
John Campbell: Andy, I want to maybe circle back on CCP. I think you probably expect a lot of questions there. It does seem like as you're looking to position Homes.com as, I guess, a site that kind of captures those private listings that don't abide by Zillow standard. I don't know if that's eventually as they make their way to MLS or maybe it's just a straight connection or a feed into you guys. That seems pretty clear to me. But outside of that, I'm just curious the other ways you're may be thinking about leaning in. I don't know if that's helping power maybe white label the private listing networks or something along those lines. I'm just -- I'm guessing there's probably some competitive dynamics that limit what you can say but maybe just shed some light where you can.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So I think that Clear Cooperation has always been -- people since the beginning of time in real estate have marketed listings off market. People have always looked to see if there's someone in the shop, in the neighborhood, a connection that wants to buy a property, especially at the middle, upper end of properties that happens in commercial real estate. It happens around the world. Typically, 20% of listings around the world are going to be marketed off-market or private. I don't want to get too deeply into what COMPASS is doing or what eXp is doing but just more as a general theme, I think that there is an important dynamic changing here with clear cooperation being more flexible and with the no [indiscernible] rules on the MLSs changing. You've got people beginning to question where they want their listings to go and when they want them to go there. And if you've done some research, I'm sure you've heard that the lead diversion models are not popular. They don't exist in other countries because when people have a choice as to where they market their listings, they choose not to have their leads taken and sold off. So I think there's generally some anxiety on the part of some of those folks that people will make more choices to avoid the lead diversion platforms longer and that positions us really well because we're actually in harmony with everyone because we are actually presenting their listings with their names on them and are not trying to rewrite the rules or -- we're not trying to regulate it. We're pretty much working with the clients as they want to work. But we're not going to get into any debates between different firms on the strengths of Clear Cooperation, private networks and all that stuff. I think they do it anyhow and they have done it since the beginning of time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW.
Ryan Tomasello: I wanted to double-click on multifamily. I guess, can you help us understand what's driving the growth decel in the second quarter to 10% and your confidence in the implied acceleration in the back half of the year? And does that bake in any benefit at all from the sales force investments? And considering the incentives you called out for prioritizing property growth, how should we consider the evolution there on pricing versus property count? And then just lastly, on bookings. I don't think we got any color on apartments bookings in the quarter. So anything you're willing to provide there would be helpful.
Christian Lown: Yes. So snuck in a couple of questions there. So one, remember, the second quarter is the big quarter for Apartments.com. That's when the big conference happens, happens in June, sort of the back end of the second quarter. So that flows through in the third and fourth quarter. So that's the dynamic that happens year in and year out. I think you have that dynamic, in addition to have the dynamic of the additional head count from a sales perspective. As Andy said, the rent period sales force is a fantastic sales force. They're actually already up and running. They've had a great experience trying to sell against us. So now they get to sell for us. So we'll get acceleration there. Ensuring that the sales team is focused on the right things. Rooftops is important and pricing is important but we feel good about that acceleration. So all that translates into a third and fourth quarter increase in our acceleration of where we are versus the second quarter. So that all makes us feel relatively good. And we didn't provide a net new number for apartments but you should assume a sort of in the mid-20s million range for net new bookings.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.
Stephen Sheldon: On the suite, I guess, is your thinking about the degree of pricing increases changed at all? I think you've typically talked about roughly 3% to 5% annual uplift. But just given your dominant positioning there and continuing to add new data sets, new forms of value, could you potentially look to be more aggressive on that front in the coming years, especially if the CRE backdrop continues to improve?
Andrew Florance: I would emphasize that we've been coming through a very challenging commercial real estate market. It is, I think, a real testament to CoStar that we continue to show good growth through a very brutal market condition for commercial real estate. I do believe that -- historically, we've always slowed our pricing increases during difficult markets to support our clients. And then we are generally more aggressive with our price adjustments when we are in good markets for our clients. And I think it's pretty clear that we are moving into a better market for our clients. You can see it in the availability rates dropping. You can see vacancy edging over. You see transaction volumes picking up. We tend to talk about the markets turning a little bit earlier than our clients understand they're turning. So -- but they definitely are turning, barring anything in a recession, a major recession happening, generally, the overall fundamentals for real estate are good and would allow us to be a touch more aggressive in the years to come. But I think you'd also just see volume increasing, too.
Christian Lown: I'd also add that the value proposition that Andy has developed over CoStar since the development is massively different today than it was right at inception where it's primarily a broker product with lender, with the lease benchmark product that's coming with STR. I mean the value proposition about to create additional revenue streams or compound sort of the value is dramatically different. So the model has also changed with [indiscernible] to our advantage as we roll out those products and expand TAMs as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: It sounds like when you were talking about Homes.com attrition, a lot of that was like early cancels within a contract metrics. Can you give us any sense of clients that signed on kind of last fall that were on a 6-month contract and have just naturally come up for renewal that were kind of sold on a message that was better aligned to what the value prop actually is. Just like what those contracts are retaining at? Or is there some reason that wouldn't start to provide a good indication at this point?
Andrew Florance: Yes. I wouldn't have specific data on fall contracts on 6-month renewal. What I can tell you is that when you look at the in-period cancellation rate, that line is dramatically down. It is falling to some pretty low numbers. And I believe the 6 month in the last month of the last -- of the 6-month in contract cancellation is 0.25% which is de minimis. It had been up at a much higher number, maybe 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% at the beginning. And again, I believe a big part of that was just in the excitement of the early launch everyone thought we were selling lead diversion and no one knew what the whole rest of the world is buying which is digital marketing for real estate which is what apartments is, it's what LoopNet is, it's what REA Group, Rightmove, everyone else is. So we were offering something new. Now we had a very small sales force, a generalized sales force. But now I'm very happy with seeing it's up in that 40 NPS range which is outstanding. And to do it that quickly suggests to me that we will have solid renewal rates going forward.
Christian Lown: I'd also highlight the preponderance of our contracts are 12 months. So again, the data is moving in the right direction. But I think your question is better to be asked in sort of the next 3 to 6 months as they start to roll forward.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Andy Florance for any closing remarks.
Andrew Florance: Well, I think I've taken all the time I was allotted for this year. So we're off to a great start in '25. Again, I want to thank the Board members who are completing their service to the company and welcome the new Board members on board. I'm very excited about the progress we're making with Homes.com and with the great performance we're seeing across basically all of our product areas. Thank you all for joining us and your patience on the call. And we look forward to updating you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-18 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q4 2024 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Rich Simonelli, Head of Investor Relations.
Richard Simonelli: Hello, and thank you very much for joining us today to discuss the fourth quarter 2024 and full year 2024 results for the CoStar Group.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andrew Florance: Again, thank you for joining CoStar Group's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. We achieved another very strong quarter of financial results with 2024 full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeding consensus and the high end of our guidance range. Revenue for the full year of 2024 was $2.74 billion, an increase of 11% over the full year of 2023, as we delivered our 55th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. For the fourth quarter of 2024, revenue was $709 million, an 11% increase year-over-year. We continue to generate profit while we are investing aggressively back into the business to create powerful future growth drivers, such as Homes.com. For the full year, our commercial information and marketplace businesses achieved a very strong 43% profit margin. For CoStar Group, net income EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA significantly improved each quarter in 2024. We grew net income from $7 million in the first quarter of '24 to $60 million in the fourth quarter. We increased EBITDA from negative $13 million in the first quarter to $73 million in the fourth quarter. We grew adjusted EBITDA from $12 million in the first quarter to $112 million in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA of $112 million in the fourth quarter was well ahead of our guidance range of $76 million to $86 million. Our average monthly unique visitors to our global websites increased 17% year-over-year to $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Google Analytics. Company net new bookings were $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 21% sequentially from the third quarter of 2024. Net bookings are increasing because our sales forces are now optimized and back to selling their respective core product offerings. When we launched Homes.com sales just 12 months ago, we only had 41 Homes.com sales professionals to prospect over 1 million real estate agents. To backstop this very small team, we temporarily test all of our sales forces to sell Homes.com. We no longer need to do that because over the past year, we've grown the Homes.com sales force nearly six-fold to 277 salespeople. We anticipating having -- we anticipate having 500 home salespeople by year-end 2025. The dedicated home salespeople understand the significant value proposition Homes.com offers well. So they sell more, service more effectively, earn much higher NPS scores and renew the business at much higher rates. From all perspectives, having homes Expert sell Homes.com CoStar Expert sell CoStar and apartments experts sell Apartments.com yields higher net bookings. Our CoStar product achieved $1.02 million -- $1.02 billion in revenue in 2024, with a growth rate of 10% year-over-year. CoStar continues to be the preeminent source of information analytics for the industry. During the worst commercial real estate market in our lifetime, we have grown revenue, adjusted prices for inflation, and launch innovative, valuable new products and features like lender and hospitality benchmarking. With the full CoStar sales teams focused on selling CoStar December 2024 was the highest month of net bookings for CoStar in almost two years. Q4 2024 net new bookings were the highest since Q3 of 2023. We are pleased to report accelerating CoStar sales in the year as we cross $1 billion in CoStar revenue. The CoStar subscriber base has grown to over 240,000. Our renewal rates are very strong at 92%. We monitor our Net Promoter Scores closely to continually improve our service offering and maintain high renewal rates. Over the past three years, our U.S. CoStar NPS has improved 10% to 65%. Our Canadian CoStar NPS has improved 25% to 60%. Most notably, our U.K. CoStar NPS has improved 35% to 65%. That's really remarkable improvement there. The U.K. CoStar team's significant success in achieving high NPS scores might have led to our primary U.K. competitors, EG's recent announcement that they were withdrawing all their products and services from the U.K. in 2025. EG or States Gazette was founded 166 years ago in 1858 during Queen Victoria's reign and before Abraham Lincoln became President. CoStar has competed against EG and its various companies since we acquired Focus in the U.K. in 2004. We first began competing with them. They were primarily a weekly commercial property news magazine, stuffed with hundreds of high paying property ads, but they launched an online commercial property service. EG has also launched an online marketing service called EG Property Link that compete with LoopNet. As CoStar gained leading share in the U.K., EG merged their information offering into a brokerage affiliated consortium called Radius. EG was owned by the information giant RELX. In their announcement, they cited irreparable impact of headwinds that have struck the whole of commercial real estate industry hard. I'd like to believe that to some degree, the quality of research field -- research service and technology that our team provides played some competitive role. RELX may have sold or may in the future sell elements to discontinued businesses to other companies, it’s with respect that we acknowledge the hard work contribution achievements of one of the U.K.'s leading commercial property and information sources over 166 years. It's our competitors that motivate us to be the best we can be. Obviously, the Syria economy has created strong headwinds for CoStar over the last four years as well, but I believe those headwinds may shift to tailwinds. I believe that the Syria economy has passed its nadir and is moving into what may be a very strong recovery. Demand and absorption for office space turned meaningfully positive at the end of 2024 for the first-time since 2021. Availability rates are falling, total available space is declining. Sublet vacancy rates are falling, sublet rents are climbing. The new construction pipeline is shut off and net supply after depreciation and obsolescence is contracting. The economy is strong and resilient. We read stories about major corporations mandating five days a week in the office and then the observation that there's not enough space for the company in their offices to allow everyone to return to work. In the first quarters of the pandemic, office owner steeply discounted prime office space and leased it to tenants who normally have a second generation budget. I believe that we could see very strong rent growth in the years ahead with capital appreciation. We are already seeing sales transactions return to pre-pandemic levels and cap rates are rolling over their peaks. I've managed CoStar through four economic cycles or four real estate cycles. And every time the world is certainly the office sector will never again regain its value. And yet every time the correction over the shoots in the office economy roars back. CoStar and our clients may enjoy tailwinds in the next few years. The CoStar for Lenders product continued to gain momentum this past quarter. Q4 was our best quarter for the year with $1.7 million of net new annual revenue in December across 17 institutions, bringing total annual revenue to $75 million, including risk analytics. We now have signed up 370 institutions of all sizes and types, who collectively manage over $1 trillion of CRE debt, reinforcing our role as a key solution in the industry. Clients have been actively uploading portfolios over the last two years, further validating our long-term adoption stickiness and the depth of our platform's integration into our clients' lending cycles. Additionally, we're seeing a growing number of clients transitioning from their initial CECL or current expected credit loss and stress test solutions to ours. A clear sign that our platform is outperforming alternatives and capturing market share in a regulatory-driven segment. Despite a challenging high interest rate environment and cautious lending landscape over the past couple of years, we had continued to demonstrate consistent revenue growth in our lender solution. Corporate real estate departments are increasingly subscribing to CoStar as well to manage their costs, find the best spaces to support their operations and efficiently renew their leases. These corporations already rely on brokers who are very often using CoStar. But increasingly, corporate users want direct access to CoStar as well to support a faster velocity and analysis and decision-making. New corporate subscribers to CoStar this year include great brands like Amazon, Visa, Ecolab, Macy's, Church's, UnitedHealthcare, Cracker Barrel, Cisco, Edward Jones, Salesforce, Sherwin-Williams, LG and many others. CoStar Group leases announced more than 1 million square feet of real estate across dozens and dozens of locations, and our facility staff as well use CoStar daily and find it indispensable. Despite it being some of the most important information owners and tenants need. Historically, accessing accurate and useful rent information has been very problematic and difficult in CRE. Rents are quoted a myriad of ways with numerous modifiers and inclusions and exclusions that can completely change the meaning of the numbers. Often, the details of individual lease deals are closely guarded. We have begun the integration of CoStar Real Estate Manager and our newly acquired operation visual lease, managing more than 1 million leases for thousands of major corporations. These two companies are leaders in lease accounting, lease management and transaction management. Our intention is to build the next generation in corporate real estate digital solutions by integrating these two products with CoStar and empowering our clients with the anonymized aggregated information we and this community of corporates can bring together. Just as CoStar STR aggregates and anonymizes the confidential pricing and occupancy information for the world's major hotels and creates in invaluable, accurate and precise hospitality revenue information that, that industry relies on, we intend to do the same thing for corporate real estate. This would empower decision makers to quickly evaluate potential transactions and understand if they're reasonable in the marketplace. Corporate occupiers with hundreds or even thousands of leases renewing in a quarter or year would have very good visibility into how new rent levels would increase or reduce their cost on renewal. Within CoStar, users would be able to access very precise rent levels by geography, segment and quality, empowering them to make better informed leasing, valuation, lending, transaction development and investment decisions. Building this next-generation corporate real estate solution and the associated rent indices is one of our top priorities for CoStar in 2025. We believe that the total addressable revenue opportunity for CoStar is enormous and that this initiative will help us recognize more of that huge TAM sooner. We continue to make good progress on building CoStar in Europe and particularly in France for the top markets there, and we expect to release CoStar France by year end 2025. We intend to grow the CoStar sales team by 20% this year. Turning to LoopNet. It's the most heavily trafficked marketplace for commercial real estate in the United States and one of the most effective ways to market commercial real estate. We believe that it has more than $1 billion TAM in the U.S. alone. In 2025, one of our primary objectives is to move the asset based pricing -- move to asset based pricing, where the price to market high-value properties is greater than the price to market lower value properties. We have begun renewing contracts on this basis and for the first cohort of contracts that received price increases, 98% have renewed at the significant price list. We believe that we can expand the volume of properties market on LoopNet by lowering the price point for some properties for which the current one size fits all pricing is not affordable. We are shifting our sales force's emphasis from selling a few higher priced depth advertisements to selling higher volumes of asset based priced advertisements. While we will continue to sell the higher tier ads, we believe that we will generate significantly more revenue growth by selling a higher mix of the silver basic tier ads that renew at a very high level. Along with crossing the $1 billion revenue mark in 2024, Apartments.com turned in a very strong fourth quarter. Revenue was $276 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Our multifamily revenue is subscription-based with outstanding customer satisfaction with NPS scores of 94 or average NPS score of 94 and very high renewal rates in the 90s with a monthly renewal rate of 99%. In 2024, we reached 90% of renters and all of our prospects and clients through almost every marketing channel. In 2025, we expect to deliver 13 billion impressions across TV, streaming video, podcasts, social media and influencers, direct digital paid search and display. We'll be launching five new advertising spots for Apartments.com with Jeff Goldblum. Our marketing campaign continues to deliver with top programming venues. In March, you'll see us all over March Madness. Our unmatched retargeting program creates 1 billion annual impressions and 1.4 million leads. Apartments.com continues to be the industry leader across many key metrics. We have set the standard in multifamily for high quality leads and a strong in-person sales force. Apartment owners see Apartments.com as number one in the metric that matters most to them delivering leases. In 2024, according to Entrada, we produced 1.5 times more leases than all of our competitors combined. Most importantly, Apartments.com delivered 3 times the number of leads that convert to leases compared to our competitors. So with the most leads and the best conversion rate, we delivered 4.8 times more leases than other rental networks. We dominate apartment search engine results and are number one in organic search for the term apartments. We are also number one in paid search with 1.8 times more than all the competitors combined. We had 35 million average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter for our Apartments.com network. SimilarWeb reported that Apartments.com had the most visitors in 2024 and more than Zillow and rent.com combined. The Apartments.com network delivered by far the most visits in the industry with $920 million in 2024. With consumers, we have dominated brand awareness with two out of three apartment seekers saying they will use Apartments.com, that is nearly double Zillow and 5 times more than rent.com. We have higher brand awareness than Zillow and Rent.com combined among apartment seekers. We continue to add new customers with properties of all unit counts to our marketplace at a rapid pace with more than 75,000 paying apartment communities on our network, up 7% year-over-year. This includes more than 10,000 in the 5- to 49 unit range. Business to our House condo and townhouse pages increased 25% year-over-year and 32% in Q4 2024 over the prior year. We increased the number of single-family rental listings by 26% over $3 million year-over-year or over $3 million, not year-over-year. In 2024, paid single-family rental listings increased 59% year-over-year to 323,600, with a number of independent rental owners using Apartment.com climbing to 13% to 244,000. For the year, we processed nearly $5 billion in rental payments or just over $5 billion in rental payments. In a little over a year, we are already number one in traffic in Canada, our newest Apartments.com market which demonstrates the success we can have extending a brand from one market -- one country to another. There's still a lot of room to grow this business. We see $2.6 billion of opportunity in the 20 unit plus buildings and above, and there is much more opportunity below 20 units. We believe there is more than a $9 billion TAM in multifamily. We intend to grow the Apartment.com sales force headcount 23% in 2025 to keep up with the potential of the site. Last week, Redfin announced an agreement to transfer basically the guts of the apartments Redfin portal business to Zillow. Redfin acquired RentPath, the parent company of rent.com, an apartment guide for $608 million in February of 2021. Redfin was able to purchase RentPath after the FTC blocked our $588 million purchase of it after RentPath had gone bankrupt. On the day Redfin purchased RentPath, its stock was trading at 98 a share. And since that date, their stock is dropped precipitously down 91% to $8.87 a share at yesterday's close. I think it's safe to say that Rent.com has not performed well under Redfin. So probably good that it's moving on. While the announcement called the deal of partnership, I believe it's effectively a sale of the asset that attempts to avoid FTC regulatory review. I find it hard to believe the FTC will ultimately surrender the authority to investigate the potential loss of competition that this deal appears to achieve. We believe that if present to the FTC as a transaction, the FTC would obviously block such a deal. As part of the deal, Zillow pays Redfin $100 million upfront. Redfin terminates 450 of the vast -- or Redfin will be terminating 450 or the vast majority of the Rent.com staff, and Redfin will attempt to transfer its apartment property management clients to Zillow. Effectively going forward, Rent.com will no longer operate as a normal independent competing website, but rather will only operate as a shell syndication site sending leads to Zillow. We do not know the terms and costs of the lease syndication deal, but I would not be surprised if Zillow ultimate has to pay Redfin hundreds of millions, if not $1 billion for what we see as relatively low converting leads. This would not sound like an attractive transaction. Certainly, apartment property managers will have less choice now. We see a large opportunity to win away many of the properties formerly market on rent.com without paying Redfin amass sum of money. It feels like jump ball on the former Redfin clients, and our Paige Forrest and team are quite tall. We launched the new Homes.com just one year ago during Super Bowl 58. And roughly at same time, we acquired the residential portal on the market in the U.K. and relaunched it as well. In just one year, we've made tremendous progress towards our goal of providing the leading residential real estate portals and monetizing a new multi-billion dollar TAM opportunity for CoStar Group. In less than one year, the Homes.com network became the second largest real estate portal in the United States based on traffic with an audience of $110 million average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter, according to Google Analytics. 110 million unique visitors is nearly double realtor.com's 62 million average monthly unique visitors that News Corp reported for the same quarter recently. I think that's remarkable. Realtor.com launched 30 years ago in its predecessor form back in 1995, and we passed them in apples-to-apples traffic in our first year of the relaunch. We began the year with our low-single digit unaided awareness and during the year 00 built and grew that awareness number to as high as 33%. As we complete our second successful Super Bowl campaign and launch our 2025 campaign, I believe that we can reach 50% unaided awareness this year potentially surpassing in two years with our competitors spent 30 years building. We began last year with 41 Homes.com salespeople, and today, we have 275. With job offers outstanding, we are forecasting an additional 50 hires in March alone. Our goal is to have 500 Homes.com salespeople in place by the end of the year and productive. Achieving that goal, our Homes.com sales force will go from basically not existing last year to being one of our largest sales teams in just two years. Despite that, the fact is the entire team is literally rookies, but they're selling effectively. During Q4, the team in production sold on average 1,742 net new monthly revenue. As the denominator grew dramatically coming into January with more new head count, the January number remains strong at 1,636 net new per month. In January, the dedicated home sales team sold $3.73 million in annualized net revenue based upon that group's sales and their cancels. I expect that as the team both grows and becomes more experienced, that the sales numbers will increase significantly. The dedicated home sales team is significantly more effective at servicing our new clients, achieving good net new promoter scores and renewing business then was the stop gap broader sales effort we put in, in the beginning of the year on ad-hoc basis. We launched the new Homes.com memberships last year, I believe we offered a better value proposition than did the legacy residential portals, but it required educating real estate agents accustomed to buying agency leads for 30 years, and we need to educate them to the fact that we were selling solutions to win more seller listings. Simply put, Homes.com provides a unique Internet marketing solution that helps agents sell the home they were hired to sell faster and for more money, making them better listing agents. Because they can show prospective homebuyers that they have a superior selling solution, they should be hired more often. In contrast, the legacy solutions in the past 30 years sell agents leads that really belong to competing agents. Our model is used by 95% of the real estate portals around the world and is associated with profitable real estate portals. And that stands in contrast to the legacy U.S. portals, which are really in the minority with the lead diversion model and has struggled with profitability. When we first launched, many agents thought that we were just like the legacy portals selling them leads that belong to competing agents. So initially, we had negative NPS scores that need improvement. As we built a dedicated Homes.com sales team just focused on selling and servicing residential agents, they did a much better job communicating our superior value proposition. Our NPS scores have climbed dramatically throughout the year. When the broader sales force first began selling last year, our NPS was negative 40. But by January, our dedicated home sales team is achieving an average NPS score of 28, which is in the good category and 2 points away from the great category. At CoStar Group, we're accustomed to consistently achieving great and excellent NPS scores, but brand new products do not launch it excellent. When apartments first launched the NPS scores were 10 and now a decade later I mentioned, the average 94. Homes.com’s MPS, climbed 68 points in just one year. I want to congratulate the team on that achievement. It's an incredible accomplishment. We already have many of our Homes.com sales reps earning excellent MPS scores at 80 and above. Our goal is to get everyone up in that range. We expect that higher NPS scores will drive higher renewal rates and drive additional sales through referrals. When we relaunched an all-new Homes.com site one year ago, I felt we offered one of the best search experiences for buying or selling a home. While I was extremely proud to work with exceptional development product teams on such a successful launch. I am even more proud by how much those teams have accomplished in the first 12 months after that great initial launch. At our sales conference a week or so ago, I walked through over 110 new important features our teams added to the product across 2024. The features are too numerous to detail but include innovative valuation tools, lead verification, search by commuting distance, visualization layers to assess crime, schools, renters, owners, residential and adding residential news and much, much more. When I look at the product road map in the year ahead, I believe it's the most innovative work that I've ever seen in my career by a wide margin. I feel that everyone in the Homes.com product and development team is excited to be working on one of the most effective, innovative and exceptional development teams anywhere in any industry. There are three major initiatives for Homes.com in 2025 that we believe will add new revenue streams to Homes.com. Our U.K. residential real estate portal on the market also achieved significant growth in our first year running it. In just one year, we've grown the number of advertisers 23% and the number of properties listed by over 40%. Our marketing investment has led to an increase in total visits by 75%, which in turn generated 42% more leads for agents. As a result, on the market has seen eight consecutive months of net new revenue growth. Last week, launched the new Homes.com second year with two -- we launched the new year, year two, with two new Super Bowl ads. I was proud that Adweek raised our ads as number two in Super Bowl ad ranking this year. We believe that Homes.com is now the best site for hub shoppers, sellers, agents and brokers. Homes.com has a clean spam free design, more content than other sites have, robust and growing product functionality and most importantly, a better business model in which all the parties can be aligned. We want to let the world know that Homes.com is the best, but our attorneys say we cannot legally say that. So we built an ad campaign trying to say that we are the best, but not doing it in line with our reality. This year, our two 30 second Super Bowl ads featured Morgan Freeman, Dan Levy and Heidi Gartner. When Morgan Freeman tries to say Homes.com is the best. It sounds like the voice of God. Overall, our marketing campaign for Homes.com continues to deliver strong results. In 2024 we delivered nearly 19 million impressions with nearly 3 billion impressions in Q4. In 2024, we ran more than 47,000 commercials, including spots and high profile media like the Olympics, the World Series, College Football, the NFL, the Grammys, the Emmys and across primetime TV and streaming video like Netflix, Disney, Paramount, YouTube and ESPN. We are also advertising on streaming audio partners like iHeartRadio, Spotify, Pandora and Amazon Music, including podcasts like Freakonomics, Mad Money and Conan O'Brien. We are all over social media with millions of impressions on Meta, Pinterest, Reddit and TikTok tack and whatnot. 90% of Americans have likely seen Homes.com ads. We believe that we have built the best site for buying and selling a home. Our members are gaining dramatically more exposure for their sellers on Homes.com. They're listing sell faster and for more money on average. And because our members offer superior marketing solution, they're winning 58% more listings. We had a great first year for Homes.com and we're building phenomenal momentum to create the leading site for buying and selling homes. I believe that we can win major share grow a third $1 billion business and generate substantial long-term EBITDA value for our shareholders. A quick update on Matterport. CoStar and Matterport have each certified substantial compliance with the FTC's second request and continue to work cooperatively with the FTC review of CoStar's pending Matterport acquisition. We believe we're on track for the deal to close in the first quarter. One of our main investments in 2025, we probably picked up will be growing our sales force. We plan to grow the sales force from 1,390 at December 2024 to reach 1,890 by December 2025. Adding approximately 500 salespeople will grow our sales force by 35%, and we believe bring significant revenue growth potential or incremental additional revenue growth potential to a great business. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Chris Lown, our CFO.
Christian Lown: Thank you, Andy. Full year 2024 revenue grew 11% versus the prior year. Coming in ahead of consensus and above the high end of our revenue guidance range. Full year adjusted EBITDA in 2024 came in above expectations at $241 million and a 9% margin also exceeding consensus on the high end of our guidance range. Our commercial information and marketplace brands delivered 43% profit margins for 2024, proving the underlying strength of the commercial product portfolio as we continue to invest in our residential and international strategy. CoStar revenue grew 10% in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2024, in line with our guidance. As mentioned on previous calls, CoStar revenue was positively impacted by the integration of the STR benchmarking into our CoStar platform. This integration resulted in approximately 4 percentage points of CoStar revenue growth in 2024. For Q1 2025, we expect revenue growth of 6% as STR has now been integrated into CoStar, and we expect 6% to 7% growth for the full year as we continue to manage through the challenging CRE markets. Apartments.com revenue grew by $153 million or 17% year-over-year in 2024, in line with our expectations and in line with Apartments.com's five-year revenue CAGR. We expect Apartment.com revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the full year of 2025, and we are forecasting 11% revenue growth for the first quarter. Our moderating growth rate in 2025 reflects the increased scale of Apartments.com and the impact of Apartments.com sales reps supporting both our commercial brand as well as the launch of Homes.com in 2024. We believe the expansion of our Apartments.com sales force throughout 2025 should bolster growth as we continue to penetrate the significant untapped TAMs. LoopNet revenue grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year of 2024, in line with our guidance. We expect that in the first quarter of 2025 and for the full year of 2025, LoopNet revenue growth will be in the mid-single digits, consistent with 2024 growth. Revenue from information services was $37 million in the fourth quarter and $136 million for the full year of 2024. We expect Information Services revenue growth for 2025 to be in the range of 18% to 20%, with visual lease contributing approximately $40 million of revenue. Revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be in the high-teens to low-20% range. Other marketplaces revenue was $36 million for the fourth quarter and $130 million for the full year 2024. We expect revenue growth for 2025 in the mid to high-single digits and first quarter revenue slightly below $30 million. We expect 10x transaction volumes to ramp through 2025, in line with an expected improvement in overall CRE transaction volumes. Residential revenue was $28 million in the fourth quarter and $101 million for the full year of 2024. Our 2025 residential revenue growth outlook is in the high-teens to low-20%’s range, and we expect first quarter revenue growth of approximately 40%. For CoStar Group, net income was $60 million for the fourth quarter and $139 million for the full year of 2024. We earned $213 million of net investment income on our $4.7 billion in cash in 2024 and or a 5.5% net yield. Our sales force totaled 1,390 people at the end of 2024, with the majority of the increase concentrated in our Homes.com residential business. We expect to have over 500 sales reps for Homes.com by the end of 2025. Due to the large untapped total addressable market in the commercial real estate and apartment markets, we are also expanding the sales force of CoStar apartments and LoopNet to capture that opportunity. Our contract renewal rate was 89% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and remains strong at 94% of customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Net new bookings for the fourth quarter was $53 million, representing a sequential increase of 21% from the third quarter of 2024. We expect net new bookings in 2025 to be higher than 2024, and as a result of our sales forces refocused on their respective businesses, a significant increase in dedicated Homes.com sales reps compared to the first quarter of 2024, increased sales forces in our other commercial businesses and improving market conditions in commercial real estate. In 2025, we are also announcing a share buyback program of $500 million. We expect to execute $150 million of share repurchase annually which will more than offset annual non-cash based compensation. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect full year revenue of $2.985 billion to $3.015 billion implying an annual growth rate of 9% to 10%. First quarter 2025 revenue is expected to range from $711 million to $716 million, representing revenue growth of 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $375 million to $405 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 13%. First quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $25 million to $35 million. Our level of capital expenditures is expected to range from $400 million to $450 million in 2025 and with roughly $360 million of that total spend for our Richmond campus, which we expect to be substantially completed in the first half of 2026. Operating capital apart from the Richmond campus is expected to be in the $90 million range, an increase over prior years, primarily due to our planned CapEx for Arlington, Virginia headquarters. Our forecast for net interest income is approximately $170 million for 2025, taking into account our increased capital spend and possible interest rate reductions in the year ahead. This figure does not account for any M&A activity. Finally, we are withdrawing our five year revenue and EBITDA targets that we set back in February 2022. When we provided this guidance, we could not unforeseen the unprecedented long lasting downturn in the commercial and residential businesses over these several years. However, looking ahead, we continue to see significant growth opportunities in our core products. For CoStar Suite, the significant untapped TAMs, the inclusion of STR, the continued rollout and penetration of the lender product, expansion into Europe in 2025 and 2026 and additional in-development products, we've lost optimistic that CoStar will see double-digit growth again once we are through the CRE malaise. In Apartments.com, we expect to continue to see low to mid-double digit growth over the coming years, given the $2.6 billion TAM in 20 unit plus buildings and much more than that in the TAM for 1 to 19 unit buildings. These opportunities remain underpenetrated, and we are optimistic we will capture the lion's share of that opportunity as we continue to invest in the platform and deliver best-in-class metrics and service to help our customers achieve their objectives. With the relatively new head of LoopNet and brand new head of LoopNet sales, we expect LoopNet to again deliver double-digit growth in the future on the back of an expanded footprint and revised pricing strategy. Even in light of its growth from approximately $50 million when we acquired the company to nearly $300 million today, we expect this division to return to double-digit growth as we take advantage of these opportunities. With regard to our other businesses, like, real estate manager and Visual lease, Lands.com and BizBuySell, we believe these properties have long-term double-digit growth opportunities. Finally, given the meaningful industry changes in the residential real estate market, we remain enthusiastic about Homes.com as we continue to scale this platform to monetize what could be one of CoStar's largest businesses. As we increase our dedicated sales force through 2025, we expect revenue to increase in line with that growth, which will pay dividends from 2026 and beyond, delivering strong double-digit growth. In summary, I'm proud of our 2024 results delivered during a year of complicated by high interest rates, inflation and economic volatility. We remain focused on our strategic investments in the commercial and residential markets while producing record profit levels in our established commercial businesses. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Campbell with Stephens. You may proceed.
John Campbell: Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Congrats on a solid quarter.
Andrew Florance: Thank you.
John Campbell: Andy, last fall, you talked to being kind of midstream and the data collection efforts in some of the large overseas markets. And then, you guys have put out a series of press releases announcing new client partnerships. It seems like you’re -- the traction is building. I just wanted to get your take on just broadly, how long do you think it takes for international to somewhat rise is a needle mover for sweet or for CoStar? And then secondly, just international expansion to date, I mean it's kind of go unnoticed from the P&L standpoint, just as far as the investment level. I'm just wondering, if you can envision a time where you might want to accelerate that pace and more meaningfully boost the level of investment?
Andrew Florance: Sure. So we have been making steady progress there. We are in the process of implementing a little bit of financial discipline on P&L across our European operations and making sure that we're not running multiple versions, the same product running both the acquired and the general broader LoopNet CoStar platform. So we have a little bit of a case where we're running some duplicative costs. So one of the reasons you won't see as big a hit in the P&L in the years to come is that we're rationalizing some of those European operations not to run dual initiatives and move towards just a consistent CoStar LoopNet platform in Europe. As I mentioned, we'll have France up and running this year. Spain would be pretty quickly following that. And we are looking at -- moving all of our marketplaces in Europe to LoopNet this year in 2025. LoopNet is a lot easier to roll out than is CoStar, CoStar is a building-by-building sort of research process, whereas LoopNet is easier to pull together groups of listings that don't have to be comprehensive coverage, just it will be the -- we don't believe there's any other sort of pan-European international marketplace for market and commercial real estate that really meets the demand for cross-border leasing and sales activity. So we're making good progress on it. I do not see a massive P&L hit coming anywhere significant P&L hit coming associated with that in 2025. In fact, it will probably go the other way, but we continue to watch for opportunities to grow internationally, and we are making some decent progress on that front. And if you want a second question, we're having a sale today on questions.
John Campbell: I’ll go to queue. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. You may proceed.
Peter Christiansen: Thank you. Good evening. I want to double-click on the guide for apartments this year. And I guess, considering you had 7%-ish, 8% growth in properties year-over-year in '24 against almost 17% revenue growth, as you think about that 11 to 12 for '25, can you just walk us through the mix of the assumption on property growth versus pricing? And is there a function of going down market, so I guess more properties, but it takes longer for you to scale into that big TAM opportunity? Is that how we should think about it? Thanks.
Christian Lown: Yeah. I'd say a couple of things. You're right on your metrics around growth in units and pricing. So what we have seen, just to clarify, I mean, $153 million of revenue, right, it's significantly bigger, that growth versus our biggest competitor. But we still see a massive TAM opportunity to move on units, so increase unit size, but also increased pricing as well. There clearly will be more of a unit increase over the next year versus price increase. And inevitably, as you go further down into the smaller buildings, it does change a little bit the dynamics. But we believe the TAM in the larger market is still double the size of our current revenue. So there's plenty of opportunity in our key market. There's huge TAM opportunity in the 50 to 100 and the 20 to 50 market. And the biggest TAM opportunity, you got to get it right, is actually the 1 to 19 property market. So I think you're thinking about it the right way, in that there's been a pretty even mix between units and pricing over the last couple of years. I think you will see more of a push on unit, at least in 2025. But there's so much opportunity that I'm not sure that once you get through it that it will matter that much.
Andrew Florance: Pete, you can see from our NPS at 94 that we spent a lot of time with our existing customers, and that's great. That leaves those great renewal rates, client loyalty. But that's one of the reasons why you saw a relatively low property growth and then more revenue growth associated with people buying same clients buying more exposure for the same properties in a slightly higher vacancy rate market for multifamily or lower occupancy market. We're aware that we invest a lot of time with existing clients in 2024, and part of our initiative in growing the sales force is to basically have the additional headcount we need to go out and reach more new rooftops. So those new rooftops are out there. We own -- there's many tens of thousands of folks. We didn't get to talk to at all in 2024, and we hope to talk to more in 2025. On the smaller properties, one of the things we did see this year is we typically sell to those small properties with our mid-market sales team, which is centralized in Richmond, Virginia. We saw a significant increase in productivity from that group this year. So they're getting pretty good at selling to those 20-unit, 30-unit apartment communities. So I'd say that things are going well at both the larger communities and the smaller and midsized communities. But again, I think the really interesting thing is the growth in the individual properties because that market is massive. The individual townhouse, condo, home, that kind of thing.
Peter Christiansen: Thank you. That's helpful. My second question would have been on rep productivity at that level. I guess, over time, you would expect that to improve. That sounds good. Thank you.
Christian Lown: It was remarkable. Looking at the chart, it's significant improvement, pretty encouraging.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW. You may proceed.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the updated commentary around the structural growth targets, Chris. I guess as it relates to the bottom line, I was hoping you can maybe talk about your approach to managing margins over the coming years, where you think core commercial margins might go relative to, I guess, the 43% you called out for last year. And for Residential, just generally how you're thinking about the timeline to narrowing those losses more to a breakeven level? Thanks.
Christian Lown: Yeah. Sure. So what is very apparent to me seven months into the job is really how fixed cost our commercial businesses are. So you see the power of the increase in the margins every year, every quarter. And so we talked about 1% or 2% increase in margins year-in and year-out, and we're continuing to see that. So I think you can expect to continue to see that going forward, there's no big capital requirements. We continue to invest organically. And so I think that still holds very true, and it's very true in this announcement. I think importantly for the Homes.com segment, as Andy mentioned, we launched last year, but I really see this year as a real full launch, right? So we have our sales team ramped up, will ramp up through the rest of the year. We have a product that is clearly defined in a value proposition. We have a sales team that is fully selling it. We will still experience cancels. Remember, our first quarter of 2024 was a big year and a lot of those contracts were 12-month contracts. So we'll see that wave finally abate after we get through the first quarter. So I think you'll have a much clearer picture on Homes.com as second and third quarter moves throughout the year, and you'll see that momentum build. And that's what we expect from the productivity, the reduction in cancellations, NPS scores increasing, sales force increasing. So I do think you'll just see it evolve from the first to the fourth quarter of this year, and that's what we're looking forward to.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Alexei Gogolev: Hello, everyone. Chris, just to follow up on the previous question with your expectation of commercial margins continuing to improve by 1, 2 percentage points per year, what does that mean for Homes.com spend in 2025? Do you expect the U.S. portion to be roughly similar to last year? And what does it mean for international expansion for Residential business?
Christian Lown: Well, a couple of things. One, we've historically talked about our 2025 spend being roughly the same as 2024, and we're broadly in line with that. I would say we have a very close eye and pencil on expenses, and we are always looking for opportunities to make sure we're spending the right capital in the right way, but we are expecting '25 to look very similar to '24. And then on the international side, in the U.K., as Andy mentioned, we've had some great growth there in a number of key metrics that we look at. And we're expecting to start to harvest that in '25. And so I think inevitably, that it'll be slightly lower than 24%, given our investment in our acquisition; but still looking to push ahead, given a significant opportunity in the U.K. If you look at the peers, of our company, they have very attractive margins, very attractive cash flow, and we believe that we will inevitably win a lot of that business and take a leading position in that market.
Andrew Florance: Alexei, I would also say that there's a rotation where we're spending money. So you can see that headcount growth in sales. And so we are seeing cost reductions in a number of areas, and then we're reinvesting that into revenue generation. So the ratio of headcount on staff that's dedicated to sales versus producing the product initially is shifting. And then the final question I have for you is, are you in the office and you're not texting other people while we're on this call, are you?
Alexei Gogolev: No. Andy, I'm not. Thank you for this conference. I'm not texting anyone.
Andrew Florance: I just wouldn't want Jamie Diamond to find out.
Alexei Gogolev: I do have a JPMorgan background, if that makes you feel better. How about the additional comments with regards to the actual spend? Could you maybe give us some more color how are you progressing in terms of content, investments into schools and parks and some other areas? And how does that compare to last year? What sort of more investments are you planning and also investments around SMO, SEO as well as TV advertising?
Andrew Florance: Yeah. So our significant investments right now, going into 2025, are around salespeople. And we have made tremendous progress on unaided awareness going from low-single digit up to hit a high at 33%. I expect that will probably like the -- where we are going into February, March in unaided awareness with the next round of ads that you just saw with the Super Bowl. We are, in no way, increasing our investments on content or any of those other initiatives because we made tremendous progress on building that content in prior periods. And really matters now is controlling our costs and investing into revenue generation.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. You may proceed.
Stephen Sheldon: Hey, thanks. On LoopNet, how long do you think it could take for revenue growth there to accelerate as you shift more to the asset-based pricing model and shift sales focus more to the silver packages? It looks like you're assuming similar growth in 2025 to 2024, but do you think those changes could have an impact on bookings and move that as we think about rest of this year and potentially set up for acceleration into 2026? How are you guys thinking about it?
Andrew Florance: I'll give you an anecdotal answer, and then Chris will give you the official answer. But we're already in -- in January, 71% of our net new sales were the silver ad that's sort of super high renewing ad level, which probably is a flip from January the prior year where it was probably 71% of the sales being the depth advertising up in the diamonds, platinums. And we are seeing our best January and February tracking results in LoopNet in years based on that shift in strategy. But it is -- you're moving a pretty big ship. So it will take a while to actually have that reflect in year-over-year growth rates, but we're seeing really good initial results, and I'll let Chris give you the official answer.
Christian Lown: Yes, Andy was spot on. Our expectation is for the business to build momentum every quarter. So while we're expecting a fairly similar year-over-year growth versus '24, every quarter, we should see a little acceleration. And therefore, our exit rate in the fourth quarter should set us up for a good 2026. So that is our expectation. And as Andy just mentioned, the early signs of what we're doing will look positive.
Stephen Sheldon: Got it. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-on. That's helpful commentary on LoopNet. Curious if you can share anything on overall net new bookings activity in the first six to seven weeks of 2025 and whether things have continued to pick up, like you saw acceleration in 3Q into 4Q. Curious, what you're seeing there?
Christian Lown: We're not giving guidance, but I feel -- we feel very good about our first quarter guidance that we just gave.
Stephen Sheldon: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may proceed.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. How are you monitoring, I guess, Apartments.com new logo win rates versus competitors? Or just what can you say like that gives you the most confidence that it's just a sales capacity issue and not a deteriorating win rate issue for Apartments.com with, I guess, an evolving competitive set? I just would have expected better apartments growth, easier comps and taking out the split sales responsibilities of building sales headcount, it seems like you have a number of things that should drive it.
Christian Lown: So let me just give you some numbers because I always find this an interesting discussion because people never really talk about the numbers. And so in 2024, we produced $153 million of additional revenue. Our next biggest competitor, I think, was $96 million. We have over 75,000 properties on our platform. They have 50,000 properties. Our revenue basis reached $1.1 billion. The revenue base is sub-$500 million. any growth rate that they put on the table, you have to have. You have to more than have because we're more than twice the size. And so inevitably, there was a distraction of the sales force. And because that happened in the first and second quarter, I mean, from a roll rate and a renewal perspective, it will impact us a little more in 2025. But I think we have incredible opportunity ahead of us. I think both of these businesses have incredible opportunity ahead of us. We think we can double our revenue in our core TAM. And as Andy said, our mid-market team does great, and we're actually going to push as we expand that sales force into those markets and really penetrate that TAM. But the lower level -- the lower unit TAM is also fairly large. So again, much more -- much bigger business, really attractive growth prospects, much higher margins. And Andy made a point, he was talking about as other competitors. Our competitors make us better, and we welcome the competition. But I think people have to put this back into context of what the size of our business is, what the growth of our business is, what the margin profile of our business is and what that represents. So we're enthusiastic. We're excited and we're looking forward to tackling not only the huge TAM we've already penetrated, but the other TAMs as well in the segment.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Andy Florance for any closing remarks.
Andrew Florance: Well, I think you hit Chris' button on that last question, but I have to agree. We're Apartments.com 94% NPS score, 99% monthly renewal, growing both headcount, growing production in the mid and in the upper end. So we had a very strong 2024. I want to thank all the staff who made it a strong 2024, the salespeople, the researchers, the software developers, the product managers. We look forward to delivering outstanding results in 2025 and reporting good progress on all of our major product areas. And thank you for joining us and look forward to seeing all of you in the near term.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q3 2024 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Rich Simonelli, Head of Investor Relations.
Rich Simonelli: Hello, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the third quarter 2024 results of the CoStar Group.

Andrew Florance: Thank you for joining CoStar Group's third quarter earnings call. Welcome back, Rich. I noticed you missed a few earnings calls.
Rich Simonelli: Yes, I was enjoying myself on the Eastern Shore.
Andrew Florance: You were working remote?
Rich Simonelli: Yes.
Andrew Florance: And now you're back working a real job?
Rich Simonelli: Well, you should be when you're in the office business, you should be in the office.
Andrew Florance: That's right. Welcome back.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you.
Andrew Florance: We achieved another strong quarter of financial results. Third quarter 2024 revenue was $693 million, an 11% increase year-over-year and in line with our guidance. This is the 54th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for CoStar Group. Our core businesses are strong industry leaders. I'm extremely pleased that each of our billion-dollar businesses, CoStar and Apartments continued to grow revenue 10% and 16%, respectively. We are on track for 17% revenue growth in multifamily in 2024, a business that's now approaching $1.1 billion in run rate revenue. We grew net income in the quarter to $53 million, up from $7 million in Q1 '24. We grew EBITDA in the quarter to $51 million, up from negative $13 million in Q1 '24. Our adjusted EBITDA of $76 million in the quarter was well ahead of our guidance range of $47 million to $52 million. The early part of 2024 was our most intensive investment period into Homes.com. The profit margin of our commercial information and marketplace businesses remained strong, increasing to 43% in the quarter. Our average monthly unique visitors to our global websites reached 163 million in the third quarter of 2024, according to Google Analytics, which is up 28% year-over-year. Company net new bookings were $44 million in the third quarter of '24. We launched Homes.com earlier this year. And when we did, we only had 41 dedicated salespeople to selling Homes.com. At the scale of the product, we need a much larger sales force to take advantage of the opportunity. So we asked all the sales teams across CoStar Group to help sell the new Homes.com product. They did successfully sell a significant volume of Homes.com but it came at the price of selling less of their core product. The reality of pivoting the entire sales force to new product is that they are all rookies in selling the new product. This means lower productivity, lower service skills and suboptimal command and value propositions. That causes lower overall productivity and renewal rates in the early sales process. But it's worth it for launching a major new product with long-term potential. We have been ramping the dedicated sales teams quickly and now all but 200 the dedicated home sales teams quickly -- and now all but 200 of the overall CoStar Group, CoStar apartments and LoopNet salespeople are back to selling their respective products as they're only in core focus. It takes about one to two quarters to completely refill these pipelines. So I expect an improvement in net new bookings in Q4 and throughout 2025. We are already seeing an upturn. September was the strongest month in net new sales in our CoStar product in the past year. While we are growing at dedicated homes.com sales force, we are concurrently investing to grow the sales teams of CoStar, LoopNet and Apartments.com as well by more than 100 sales reps each. We believe there's more than enough market opportunity to productively engage the additional sales headcount. In the four years since the COVID lockdown in March 2020, we have experienced the worst commercial real estate market in a generation. Even considering these significant headwinds, CoStar continues to be the preeminent source of information and analytics for the industry and grow revenue. Our CRE business has performed remarkably well during this time, having steadily grown subscribers and prices while maintaining an incredible 93% renewal rate in the third quarter of 2024. We also launched new products for institutional clients, namely owners and lenders as institutional sales are a major part of our net new sales. Our sales force Net Promoter Scores are now the highest they've ever been for CoStar. We have seen much success with our lender product, which our customers use to meet banking regulatory requirements. We've experienced 36% growth since Q3 2023 and $50 million in annualized lender product revenue with only a 12.5% penetration into what we believe is a TAM of $400 million for that product area. On our last call, we announced that we had just released our owner module, which presents the largest owners of commercial real estate in an aggregate view. The product enables the user to see the company, its subsidiaries, funds and real estate assets, leasing and sales transaction history, brokerage relationships, tenants, tenant mixes and availabilities. Users of CoStar now have a comprehensive view of global owners with portfolios greater than 25 properties. CoStar will become even more valuable as the resetting of commercial property values begins to kick in '25 and '26. [$930 billion] of loans are due in '24 with approximately 30% of this total extended from last year. CMBS delinquency rates remain elevated and office delinquencies have increased notably to 7.7%. Simultaneously, I believe that there are green shoots in the office market fundamentals that may motivate buyers looking for opportunistic value. As a result, I believe you will see more transactions on 10x in the year ahead. We continue to see increased CoStar product activity engagement from our 237,000 subscribers, nearly 0.25 million but not quite. Property searches neared 73 million in the third quarter of 2024, a 17% increase year-over-year. Overall CoStar activity counts increased 29% over the same time last year. Our distinct logins have increased every month, and we set a new high mark in September with more than 164,000 distinct logins. We serve subscribers with -- for CoStar in 112 countries now. STR is an excellent addition to our CoStar product, adding powerful hospitality data and analytics for CoStar subscribers. The hotel asset class is $3 trillion in value. In August, we released analytics for more than 400 new global hospitality markets, an additional 1,200 new hospitality submarkets. With this release, we have delivered the remaining global markets that were covered by STR before the integration. We have over 85,000 properties in STR representing 11 million rooms contributing data to our platform. We track over 300,000 hospitality properties from 180 countries. We believe CoStar is the only source of this comprehensive analytic data, giving our users detailed supply and demand and hotel performance insight around the globe. Apartments.com turned in another strong quarter. Revenue was $272 million for the third quarter of '24. We continue to add new customers with properties of all unit counts to our marketplace at a rapid pace, with over 75,000 paying communities on our network, including over 10,000 in the five to 50-unit range. In the below 20-unit market, we delivered a record inventory of House condo and townhouse listings in Q3. We have seen strong growth in the rental tools business that supports independent owners with all aspects of managing the rental portfolio. Q3 posted a record number of paid user entered listings, and we processed $1.3 billion in rent payments. Single-family rental listings have boosted lead count by more than 4x for our Homes.com member engines. We had nearly 0.25 billion of total visits in Q3 with 43 million average monthly unique visitors to our Apartments.com site with exceptionally strong unaided awareness from apartment seekers at 67%. In Canada, Apartments.com generated the most unique visitors of any site according to comScore. Our marketing campaigns continue to deliver with top programming venues like the SB Awards, NBC Olympic Zone, the NFL season opener and Jimmy Kimmel Live with Jeff Goldblum as the host. Jeff Goldblum even included Apartments.com in his opening song. If this doesn't work out, he said, I still have Apartments.com, and he's always welcome home to his apartment. Apartments.com competitive position remains strong in the multifamily segment. When we bought Apartments.com in 2014, we had approximately $85 million in revenue, and we were way back to the pack at a very crowded field, which included Zillow, who had entered the market years before us. We have now moved into the clear leadership position and our revenue growth has grown about 1,200% from that point. Today, our multifamily revenue is 2.5x bigger than Zillow. And importantly, our revenue is subscription-based with outstanding customer satisfaction and very high renewal rates. When we purchased ForRent.com, I had the chance to spend some time to discussing industry dynamics with their leaders who had a few more decades of experience than I in the multifamily space. I asked them what happened to a business like Apartments.com when a bad market came about, there was a downturn. They were surprised. They stopped me and said, the question was off because we were currently in a low vacancy rate market, which was, in fact, what they considered to be a bad market. They explained that the number one player like Apartments.com does really well in both a high vacancy or low vacancy market because apartment communities will always continuously advertise on the number one platform. But that second tier player suffered during low vacancy markets because the apartment communities need less leads and cut back spend on second-tier sites or backup sites. They explained that when vacancies rise and the market becomes soft, that's when the second tier sites could grow their business as communities supplement their advertising on the primary site like Apartments.com with spend on second-tier sites. So remember, when a site start showing higher growth rates in a high vacancy market, it's a confirmation that the site is an also ran second-tier player. We are now exceeding 175,000 quality client interactions per quarter. This, along with a great product, results in a satisfied customer base, which gives us a 94 NPS rating with a 92.6% renewal rate in Q3, really a remarkable NPS rating. Congratulations to the Apartments.com team. In the third quarter of '24, LoopNet had its best net new sales quarter since Q3 '23 as the LoopNet sales force returned its focus to selling LoopNet. Despite the market's difficult conditions in the third quarter '24, total paid listings are up 4%, September also saw the highest number of meetings with clients and prospects in two years. Our traffic numbers continue to be impressive. Over the past 12 months, LoopNet had a massive 72x the unique visitors of the average competitor according to Semrush. Internationally, the Canadian LoopNet network, which is relatively new, also dominates the nearest competitor with nearly 4x the traffic according to Semrush. I'm also pleased with our progress in the U.K. as the LoopNet network delivered twice the traffic of our nearest commercial only competitor, again, according to Semrush. We are still in the bottom of the first inning when it comes to launching the new Homes.com. We effectively launched the Homes.com site in mid-February of this year. So we are now seven months into building this mega new product area for the company. Thousands of our talented staff have put tremendous effort into creating the best residential real estate portal to win over hundreds of millions of homebuyers and sellers so that ultimately, we can monetize with one million agents. With success in the U.S., our mission will be to expand globally. Many will try and read the team leaves and discern within hours, days and months with the outcome of the years ahead will be. I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to work on several large-scale projects like this, and I know the outcomes only become clear to everybody in the public over the course of several years. I feel really great about where we are -- what we're accomplishing already, and I'm highly confident that we can win major share revenue and EBITDA in this segment. We continue to hear directly from agents and focus groups brokerage industry leaders that they definitely prefer our business model of your listing your lead. Agents and brokerage firms are becoming more frustrated. They're forced to put their listings into the MLS and they have their listings sold off into lead diversion models such as Zillow and Realtor which means the seller's agent lose control over the listing and loses potential business from those diverted leads, those non-permission diverted leads. Buyers want to see who the listing agent is that they can reach out for a quick question without getting the hard sell from half a dozen buyer brokers. Sellers want the agent they hired and worked hard to find to work the leads for their homes effective sale. I believe that our business model is clearly superior to our competitors and that it will be the future model. In the U.S., our marketing campaign for Homes.com continues to deliver strong results. Year-to-date, we have delivered 15 billion impressions with nearly 5 billion in Q3. We have run more than 25,000 commercials, including spots in the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the NFL, the Grammys and most recently at the Emmys, which was hosted by our spokesperson, Dan Levy, along with his father. It was phenomenal to have new commercial content running in the Emmy's using the actors that we're hosting or an actor that was hosting them as it was a great moment for Homes.com. With SEM and digital, we're on track to generate 80 billion impressions this year for Homes.com. You, like 90% of Americans have likely seen Homes.com ads. We have four great new creatives running, which highlight how clean and beautiful the site is, the benefit of seeing the real listing age in all listing, the fact that Homes.com has been completely rebuilt to be the best and the positive impact that agents have on homebuyers and sellers lives. We monitor third-party surveys who ask homebuyers and sellers to name residential real estate portals from the top of their mind. This is unaided awareness. As your unaided awareness grows, your site traffic and value to ages can grow. Homes.com unaided awareness has risen from 4% before the marketing campaign launched in February to 33% in the most recent months. So from 4% to 33% more than a significant increase. While we have not yet achieved higher unaided awareness of the brands that have been around for decades, we're certainly closing on them quickly, and that's an important indicator. For perspective, both Apartments.com and homes had similar unaided awareness just prior to launch. In the eight months post launch, Homes.com with 33% unaided awareness has outperformed where apartments got to, which was 20% unaided awareness in its eighth month. So we're growing awareness faster for Homes.com than we did for apartments. This is particularly remarkable because homes.com is growing this share into a much more competitive segment with entrenched competitors who've been investing heavily in marketing for an extended period of time. Another unaided survey question asks home sellers and buyers, which site they plan to use Homes.com unaided intention has grown 500% this year from 4% prelaunch to 20% today. The survey also asked home sellers and buyers their likelihood to recommend Homes.com and that generates our Net Promoter Score. Here, we've done particularly well. Prior to launch, Homes.com NPS was 44, and it steadily climbed to 75% in less than a year. The Homes.com delivered 130 million average delivered 130 million average monthly unique visitors for the third quarter, according to Google Analytics, which was an increase of 17% over the same quarter last year. Homes.com had 85 million average monthly unique visitors in the third quarter, an increase of 38% year-over-year. Based on the latest data we have, we believe that -- that the Homes.com network of residential sites is now the second most heavily traffic U.S. residential portal. Homes.com creates value for agents and their home sellers by intensively marketing their listings and services. I do not believe that there's a better way to market a home for sale today than by leveraging the unique marketing power of Homes.com. According to NAR, 100% of home shoppers turn to the Internet to find their next home, making the Internet the most important marketing arena for home buying. Portals like Realtor and Zillow turn the Internet against agents by stripping away the leads from the listing agents. In contrast, Homes.com makes internet work for agents with our your listing your lead principle. Members gain advantage on homes.com because they're listing sort to the top of results. These listings are presented across many different sections of the Homes.com site highlighted in millions of e-mails and are extensively retargeted to home shoppers across the Internet. On average, Homes.com members listings are viewed on the site, 120,000 times per month, each which is 46x more than the 2,600 times a nonmember listings are viewed. So that's giving the members listings a massive amount of exposure and value to the home seller. So these members listings that are getting more exposure, they're shared 343% more often than basic listings, they're favored at 600% more often than basic listings. On average, member listings sell faster and for more money. Our member agents sell this fact in their presentations to potential home sellers and that allows them to win more valuable listing assignments. Our data shows that Homes.com members are winning 50% more listings after they become members than when the time period was before they became members. So they're winning 50% more listings, that is a very compelling potential ROI for them. Homes.com markets brokerages, brands and agents where other sites strip their identities or make them nearly invisible from the Internet. Zillow strips the brokerage of the brand, the agent from the listing and replaces it with a button contact agent, which really means contact Zillow. It's not hard to imagine why brokers and agents love homes.com since we show their name on their listings and the leads go directly to them. I estimate that homebuyers and sellers will see an agent and their brokerage name on Homes.com 272 billion times across the year. So they're not invisible on our site. They're highly promoted. The ultimate customer is the home seller paying hundreds of billions and commissions and what they want is to market their home for sale and sell it faster and for more money. That's what we help them do. When you innovate with a better business model and it's different than what has been offered in the past two decades, it takes a little time for people to understand that something is different and better. We generated another Net Promoter Score for the likelihood that a client or a member agent would recommend another agent get a membership to Homes.com. Each month, we have seen significant improvement in that NPS. Our NPS climbed 35 points between May and September or actually between May and June, and inclined 8.7 points between Jan, July, 1.4 points July to August and 6 point -- 1 point from August to September. So it keeps climbing month after month as people learn about the value proposition. Our NPS score is already good, but we hope to eventually reach the incredibly high NPS of Apartments.com. We now offer Matterport 3D tours as part of the Homes.com membership in 94 markets. Properties with 3D tours sort to the top of the list in searches and contribute to more consumer engagement. We know that Apartments.com that apartments with matter ports have 134% more time on site. It also improves the quality of a lead when consumers have more visual information about the property before they submit the lead. We believe that as more of our members use Matterport, it will increase the velocity at which they can sell their clients' homes. Homes.com is outperforming Apartments.com in revenue generation at the same relative time post launch. In the two full quarters post launch, Apartments.com generated $28 million in annualized revenue. Homes.com has nearly doubled that performance, generating $54.8 million in annualized revenues in the first two quarters post launch. As I mentioned, each time we launch a major new product, we leverage the scale of the existing sales force to bring more resources to the brand-new sales effort. As soon as practical, we build out a dedicated sales force for the new product. In this case, our top priority today is building out a dedicated sales force for Homes.com. At the point we launched the new Homes.com at this year's Super Bowl, we had 41 Dedicated Homes.com salespeople in production. We hired 28 in the second quarter and 108 in the third quarter. By September this year, we had 113 in production with 192 hired, but some still in training. Our goal is to have more than 275 salespeople hired in production by year-end. We hope to double that sales force again in '25 and bring it closer to 600 salespeople by year-end. At this point, we have a very capable sales leader for Homes.com and Andrew Stearns, and I have confidence that he can meet this key result. No pressure, Andrew. Currently, the average Homes.com salesperson with four months of experience is selling 2,108 gross monthly new sales and 1,641 net new monthly sales. That equates to 236,000 annualized billings after a year of selling at that average pace. We ramp up to 600 salespeople. We could add $142 million in annualized billings on an annualized basis. I would hope to beat that level as we continue to grow the brand and the product. On the market, our U.K. residential real estate portal continues to make great progress. We have grown year-over-year traffic by 212%, unique visitors by 348%, listing agents by 27%, sales leads by 76% and total stock by 45%. It is hard to believe that CoStar acquired on the market only 12 months ago with so much progress. Agents in the United Kingdom expressed overwhelmingly to me that they're dissatisfied with the way pricing works there with competitors. Rightmove has already publicly suggested it will increase prices by 35% in the next couple of years, and that follows a track record of years of price increases. This could create a great opportunity for -- on the market to grow in the United Kingdom. There's an extraordinary amount of change in the residential real estate market. We believe homes.com is well positioned to capitalize on this rapid transformation in the U.S. market. Generally speaking, the brokerage firms are unhappy. Post the NAR settlement in March earlier this year, more than 100 brokerage firms, including industry giants anywhere in COMPASS, have gone public wanting to take back control of their listings that their agents work hard to get. Consumers aren't happy and are becoming more aware. Under the guise of transparency, those portals have utilized the legacy MLS system to leverage sellers' listings as at to monetize diverted leads to the highest buyer agent bidder and away from the listing agent who's working on behalf of the seller. In many cases, these leads are sold to multiple buyer agent bidders. The Zillow Flex and realtor.com shared lead models unleashed multiple agents contacting unsuspecting buyers that to this day, believe that they're reaching out to the listing agent when they were clicking on the house, they were interested in. This is not only misleading. It's a terrible consumer experience. Due to the NAR settlement, MLS rules now require the buyer agents working with a buyer enter into a written agreement before even taking them on a tour, specifying the amount the agent will be compensated and who will be paying for it, the home seller or the buyer. I believe that this new rule will create significant friction and pose a painful challenge to realtor in Zillow. The buyer goes to an open house or Homes.com where you're always putting touch directly with listing agent, there is no friction as no buyer's agent agreement is needed to go see the house, that's another benefit of the -- you're listing your lead model. Of course, 90% of home shoppers will still use a buyer's agent, but they want to do so on their own terms with transparency, honesty and with their own timing. CoStar has always invested back into the business to help us grow and gain the synergies that occur from building out more products that reach more real estate customer segments across more geography. So we're a company that's always reinvested into growth. I look at a model like REA Group or Rightmove that has historically remained primarily focused on achieving the highest possible margins rather than reinvesting in growth. They're both successful businesses, very successful businesses, but may offer less long-term shareholder value growth. I believe REA Group has primarily grown by increasing pricing on a per agent basis. According to data from online marketplaces, which I believe is run by a former CEO of REA Group. So according to a reasonable authority, according to data from online marketplaces in 2009, REA Group was generating 500 pounds of revenue per month per agent. Yet by 2024, they were generating 4,500 pounds per month per agent. That's a 15% compound annual growth in fees per agent. This is a usurious $70,000 per agent annually. So generating $70,000 per agent annually. Looking forward, if REA Group continues with that value creation strategy and increases their fees per agent by 15% compound annual growth rate for the next 15 years as they did for the last 15, they'll be seeking $700,000 in fees per agent in '39. That's not possible. Things that cannot continue will not continue. I believe that they understand this problem, which is why they made the recent failed attempt to acquire Rightmove in the U.K. in seeking alternative growth. In sharp contrast, CoStar has historically made significant investments to continuously expand our customer base rather than to use a smaller one. And therefore, we've created sustainable long-term shareholder value. Our investments in buying and growing LoopNet Apartments.com were initially somewhat unpopular with investors. It's probably an understatement for those of who that are there for that. We were a $1 billion market cap business when we bought LoopNet in 2011. And just three years later, in 2014, we were a $4.5 billion market cap business when we bought Apartments.com. And certainly Zillow was the same size as we were in 2014 with a $4 billion market cap. Today, we're a $30 billion market cap business and more than double the size of Zillow's market cap. Our investment as a percentage of market cap in Apartments.com was significantly higher than the investment were today making in Homes.com. The Homes.com opportunity is bigger than the apartments and the commercial real estate information opportunities combined. Today, boom - so you may have seen just recently a press release cost, in addition to the earnings press release. And so today, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Visual Lease. The strategic acquisition is expected to enhance CoStar Group's real estate manager business line and provide additional lease management and accounting services to current Visual Lease customers. CoStar Real Estate Manager used by large enterprise-level customers, providing vital lease administration reporting compliance services, ensuring seamless workflows between real estate and accounting teams. By combining CoStar Group's resources with Visual Lease's diverse customer base, best-in-class customer retention, deep lease portfolio management expertise at a user-centric design. We're well positioned to offer a more comprehensive service offering, and continuing growth growing both nationally and internationally in this segment. Finally, I want to touch on the economy and what we're seeing in the real estate economy. The commercial real estate economy, has started to show signs of potential improvement, from what I think is probably a cycle bottom. Office prices are down 18% over the past year, and currently sit 43% below their peak level. It'd be a little worse if we were doing that in real dollars. Multifamily prices are down 11% over the past year, and are 25% off from their peak. Industrial and retail prices never saw as big a decline, and are down only 5% from their peaks. The multifamily sector continued its recent trend of better-than-expected renter demand, with 174,000 units being absorbed. This puts absorption for the year on pace to be double last year's levels, and to be near the record levels last seen in 2021. But with the wave of new construction that the sector has seen, strong absorption was not enough to match deliveries, and vacancies remained at elevated levels currently at 7.9%, and would increase a bit. With 720,000 units still under construction, those vacancy rates, I think, will remain at upper levels for quite some time. The office sector hit an all-time high in vacancy this quarter, but I'm becoming somewhat optimistic that we're about to see a turn. The rate of increase in vacancy is slowing to a crawl. One important lead indicator, sublet vacancy is now clearly falling. Another leading indicator, total availability is already falling. The spread between vacancy and availability is shrinking, usually indication of early signs of recovery. Leasing volume is back to pre-pandemic levels, though with smaller average lease size, suggesting a larger number of overall leases being signed. New construction underway at 82 million square feet, is the lowest level seen since 2013 and not far from the lowest levels ever seen. These low levels will eventually translate into shrinking vacancies, and rising rates - rents, back up the truck and load up on quality distressed office buildings on 10x that, was a little commercial inserted to build earnings call. The industrial sector contained the trend of recent quarters, with modest positive demand being matched by even more supply as the historic way of construction in the sector continues to play out. Absorption last quarter was 32 million square feet. Deliveries were almost double that at 63 million square feet, vacancy rose a bit at 15 basis points. Industrial vacancy currently sits pretty stable at 6.6%. The retail sector, which has been relative supply/demand equilibrium for the past two years, continued that trend last quarter with normal vacancy rates. The hospitality sector saw overall improved performance this past quarter. Over the past year, upper scale hotels have seen - occupancies grow up 1%, while lower scale hotels have dropped 2%. In the residential sector, mortgage rates have eased from their peak a year ago, and are down 170 basis points, but are still high enough levels to prevent a significant increase in home sales, with most homeowners sitting on mortgages below 4%. The thought of having to move to a mortgage rate of over 6%, is not appealing and it's preventing homeowners, from selling their house and buying another one. This meant fewer homes being offered for sale, which is propping prices up a bit and keeping affordability at near record lows. In summary, despite macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to demonstrate the strength of our commercial real estate and multifamily business, with continued double-digit growth and strong EBITDA margins. Our residential portals are benefiting from our product enhancements, strong marketing campaigns, growing consumer awareness, growing site traffic and revenue growth on both sides of the pond. Given the huge total addressable market, opportunities across our product offering, we believe investing in our sales forces across the board, will allow us to invigorate sales in '25, and solid revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Christopher, our CFO. Over to you, Chris.
Chris Lown: Thank you, Andy. Good evening. I'm happy to report that CoStar Group's, revenue grew 11% year-over-year in the third quarter, in line with our guidance and marking our 54th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Net new bookings for the quarter were $44 million. As Andy mentioned, we began migrating the sales force back to their core brands late in the third quarter, and we expect sales reps to rebuild pipelines in the fourth quarter, and return to higher levels of productivity in early 2025. Our core business is strong, and the total addressable market is billions of dollars. Given the size of this opportunity, we have already begun to invest in increasing the size of our sales teams in CoStar, Apartments.com and LoopNet. Looking first at our CoStar product. Revenue grew 10% in the third quarter, in line with our guidance. We are maintaining our previous full year guidance of 10% growth. Importantly, we have grown our customer base through an incredibly challenging commercial real estate market, and have continued to enhance, develop and expand the product. A key example of this is our lender product. As the former CFO, of one of the largest real estate finance companies in the U.S. I believe CoStar's lender product is the most sophisticated products, for real estate lenders on the market today. Given its strong position and leading capabilities, Lender continued to see robust growth in the third quarter, posting impressive 36% revenue growth year-over-year. Apartments.com third quarter revenue growth came in at 16%, and we are maintaining our full year guidance of 17% revenue growth. LoopNet revenue grew 5% in the third quarter, in line with our guidance and we are maintaining our full year revenue outlook, for LoopNet of mid-single-digit growth. Residential revenue came in at $28 million in the third quarter, and we now expect full year 2024 revenue, to approximate $100 million. Over the past seven months, we have continuously fine-tuned our sales strategy, and our customer service analytics for Homes.com agent members, to help inform agents of the tremendous benefits of Homes.com membership. Additionally, we are rapidly growing the dedicated Homes.com sales force. Revenue from Information Services dropped 26% year-over-year, due to the continued transition of STR into CoStar. We are now guiding for annual revenue to be modestly higher than the $130 million. Other marketplaces revenue was $32 million in the third quarter, and we now expect fourth quarter revenues, to be similar to those in the third quarter. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $76 million, producing an 11% margin, which is well ahead of our 7% guidance. We were able to successfully manage our expenses, given the current climate and our commercial information and marketplaces businesses, delivered a profit margin of 43% in the third quarter. Our sales force totaled approximately 1,340 people at the end of the third quarter, a 19% year-over-year increase, and approximately 100% more than last quarter. Our contract renewal rate was 91% for the third quarter, with the renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for five years, or longer at 95%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the third quarter of 2024. We continue to have a fortress balance sheet with $4.9 billion in cash, which earned net interest income of $56 million, a 5% rate of return. With our pending Matterport acquisition, expected to now close either in the fourth quarter of 2024, or the first quarter of 2025. Our guidance does not reflect any financial impact from this transaction. In addition, as Andy mentioned, we recently announced the $272.5 million acquisition of Visual Lease. Our guidance also does not reflect - any financial impact from this transaction, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we expect it to be accretive to earnings in 2025. Our full year 2024 revenue outlook, is now in the $2.72 billion to $2.73 billion range, representing growth of 11%. The modest adjustment to our revenue guidance range, reflects our adjusted residential guidance and less favorable property market conditions in the third quarter. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA for the year in the range of $205 million to $215 million, which is $10 million higher than our second quarter guidance. I will now turn the call back over to our operator, to open the lines for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. You may proceed.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. It seems like your commercial real estate backdrop, is improving as we speak. So how are you thinking about the growth outlook in 2025, for businesses like the Suite and LoopNet? Should we be expecting some notable acceleration there, especially as you move past the Homes.com sales distractions this year, the sales capacity sounds like you're adding? And then, just given the more favorable backdrop, how are you generally thinking about it?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So as we continue to grow the product, so a couple of different approaches to that. One is, yes, we - it's remarkable that we've done as well as we have, in this sort of difficult market. And so, when the pressure starts to ease off a bit. And again, I'm observing these improvements in, say, the office market pretty early in the cycle. I think, it will become more evident in the next quarter or two. But that will switch that from a headwind to a tailwind, which should give us a benefit. When I look at our penetration rates into brokers, corporations, owners, institutions, banks, there is plenty of room to grow and that growth is going to be easier in a better market. I feel that LoopNet's growth is a little more neutral to that environment. But I think that the fundamentals in LoopNet of growing the sales force, improving the pricing model, that will all give us some headwind. As we've grown our revenue through the years, you have to keep growing your sales force at the same productivity level, in order to cover what would be a normal very low cancellation rate. So if you're only seeing 7% annual cancels in CoStar that, still is a nut you have to sell past to continue to grow subscription revenue. So as we grow the sales force, that will give us a little tailwind, too. So optimistic about how those all look in the year to come, barring any sort of external event that occurs that we can anticipate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may proceed.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. So early in the call, you made a reference Andy, to starting to see an upturn as you reprioritize sales resources, back to their core responsibilities. Can you just go into more detail on what you're seeing? And maybe why was the distraction greater than you were kind of expecting? Because I think when you set out on this dual sales responsibilities, you tried to structure the comp plans to protect the core bookings? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So we have seen an uptick in, say, CoStar sales in the most recent month, which is basically directly attributable to people putting more of their attention into their core product. So as they - as salespeople went into selling Homes.com inevitably, like them to keep selling both products, but I think they ended up spending a little more time in the home side. And they were not as experienced as selling that new product, the value propositions were not as clear to them. So, they pretty much were slowing down a little bit, as they moved into semi rookie status in a new product area. So I really appreciate their efforts in helping that Homes.com get off to a good start. But the reality is their time was just limited. And between the two, they couldn't maintain growth in homes, and the same level of production in their core products. So this is - this is one of the dilemmas of - that you always face when you're starting a major new product area that you hope to be a $1 billion business one day. You just don't have a sales force for a $1 billion product before you begin. So we're - the pace of ramping up the dedicated home sales force that we mentioned is ambitious. It's hard work, but I think that we're making really good progress for it. And I wish I could take you, on a tour through the sales floor in Richmond, where these hundreds of home salespeople are beginning to build a really highly energized, strong sales force. And I think they'll be able to grow, into carrying that load completely on their own. And by '25, 100% of the legacy core sales teams will be back focused on their products, and that will reenergize growth. So it's a price you pay, as you launch a new potential $1 billion product line. But I think it's well worth it. It's always painful when you're doing this, but it's worth it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. You may proceed.
Peter Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the question. Andy, I was just wondering if you could talk to the potential of the homes business, and the seasonality. I would imagine some of the shorter-term contracts, maybe the renewals part so great after six months, given the low in the season. Do you think that's going to be a feature of the business? And what can you do to save that off?
Andrew Florance: Pete, I don't really think that what - I think the primary issue there was that - as you put 1,300 people into selling a new product with a day or two of training, which is all you have when you're trying to move that many people into that product area. They were selling the product without - a solidly refined value proposition, as you want to see and they we're also not as experienced in providing follow-up sales training after - at the training after the sale, or product support after the sale. And so, there was a significant number of folks who thought they were buying a buyer agent lead diversion product, which is not what they were really buying, or they even though it wasn't sold that way in some cases, they perceived that's what they were buying, because that's all that you could buy in the industry for the last two decades. I feel very comfortable about the - what we're selling as a value proposition, which is the ability to win new listings in a competitive market, at a rate greater than you were before. And what we're showing is 50% improvement in win rate on new listings. That more than gives you an adequate ROI to justify the product. And when I mentioned that constantly improving NPS score, through the year on the product with members, that shows that members are beginning to understand that value proposition. It's resonating and we're getting better and better NPS scores. So, I believe that over time, people will look at this as an annual subscription. I don't think our product - I think for people that have consistent listings, and a lot of people do, like in residential real estate, you've got 1,000,006 folks, or where the number is, of which about 450,000 are actually in the business. And they're - and doing it full time to support themselves, and probably 400 and some thousand have a consistent inventory of listings. Those folks with a consistent inventory of listings, I think, are year round continuous high renewal rate subscribers to Homes.com. The folks who don't have any listings, many of them who bought into Homes.com early on. They're not going to get the same benefit from homes, just because they don't really win a lot of listings no matter what tools they have. So that - I think that's really more what happened early on, not cycle. That's too long a question. But Pete, didn't you like Chris' line about being CFO or CEO, whatever, of a major financial institution in loving the lender product. Yes, that was strong.
Peter Christiansen: Very strong. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW. You may proceed.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you say what the revised annual guidance this year includes for residential spend, and the nonresidential EBITDA margin for the full year? And just given all the moving pieces, Andy, with respect to residential and Homes.com, I think it would be helpful if you were willing to provide some early indication of how next year's investment levels might trend at least relative to this year, just to give some folks reassurance around how that might impact margins, over the near term? Thanks.
Andrew Florance: So I'll answer the second part first, and then Chris can answer the first part second. So I think that we are already - we launched Homes.com, with a very aggressive investment level that, I think is appropriate for a product opportunity this scale and size. So the good news - the bad news is that was a big investment. The good news is, it's at a level that I think it sustains us. So I don't see a need to increase our investment in marketing, or in Homes.com as we go into next year. So I think that improvement in EBITDA you've seen through the year, is sort of indicative of the fact that we saw a low point in net investment, in the EBITDA associated with that investment. So, I'll have Chris answer the second part.
Chris Lown: Yes. And I think to the second point, we're still on track to spend the amount we have discussed throughout the year in residential, and we continue to see continued growth in margins in the commercial businesses that we've discussed. So I think we're on track by for the numbers that we discussed historically, and no real change.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to also ask about the resi business. Can you elaborate on how much of your reduction to the residential guide is, due to the sales force productivity issues you mentioned versus client demand? And discuss how overall client demand for Homes.com memberships, is tracking relative to your internal expectations?
Andrew Florance: So I would say that, I would say that it's more - it's not so much about client demand. It is about sales force mechanics. It's about how many people you put - you can put onto the product and training cycle up, at what pace? So what we're seeing is, as we hire a significant number of - I don't want to say junior, but not senior salespeople. We're hiring a number of salespeople successfully into the homes sales force. A very high percentage of them are ramping up very quickly to a production level that, covers their cost in their first year [technical difficulty] with the company. And then moves them into being very profitable in out years. So it's not so much like they're all - like we're finding plenty of demand. It's more of a question of how many people do you have approaching the opportunity? And how fast can you hire people? I mean there's a limit to how many people you can hire into a sales - role like that, before you start to lose quality, or the things begin to rattle too much. So adding 108 people in a quarter is pretty good, but we wouldn't want to go too far ahead of that, because that's just a lot of people are bringing on board.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens Inc. You may proceed.
John Campbell: Hi guys, thanks for the question. I know there's some seasonality in the spin, particularly with marketing spend that's typically higher in the front half, but - it looks like sales and marketing dropped sequentially pretty sharply. That was the first, I think, sequential drop you guys have seen in 3Q since maybe 2019. So kind of related to Ryan's question here, as you think about the resi investment next year? Andy, it sounds like you don't expect that to go up. But my question is, could that initially go lower from a growth standpoint. I would imagine you're not probably doing the same amount of Super Bowl commercials, I would imagine the step down, and spend probably was a little bit less SEM, so you're still seeing good traffic at lower levels of spend. So I'm just curious about, if there's a potential for it to actually go lower next year?
Andrew Florance: Well, I'll give you one glimpse. we are anticipating a 33% reduction in Homes Super Bowl ads this year. So that gives you some indication. But again, we remain bullish about the opportunity and what we're accomplishing. We see indicators that make us feel good about where we're going with this opportunity. So, we are likely to continue to push on it into next year, and don't see us pulling back dramatically from where we were this year, nor accelerating from where we were this year.
Chris Lown: And I think it's important to remember, we will be growing the sales force pretty meaningfully. So actually, that sales force increase will drive expenses and will be partially offset by some lower marketing spend. So there will be some change in the mix, but inevitably, it probably ends up at the same level.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Hi Andy, just a big picture question here. As you think about the Homes.com product and just conceptually, you can make the argument that it's possible to build a perfect product, execute perfectly on our product, but for maybe factors beyond your control, it just doesn't work out. So how are you thinking about, some of the metrics beyond just like a net bookings number, to kind of understand the decision-making and how patient that you're willing to be, or how patient investors should be?
Andrew Florance: Well, again, you have this phenomena where people in seven months want a conclusive result, and that doesn't happen. You don't build a $1 billion product in seven months. And - but what we're looking at is we're looking at, our growth in consumer awareness, our ability to bring people to our site preference for our site, which we're seeing a clear preference for our site. And we are watching a shift in the industry, away from buyer agency lead diversion to something, where folks are looking to have the portals do what they do in the rest of the world, which is to market the home for sale, which is the whole point to begin with. So, we're pretty excited about everything that's occurring despite the fact that it's hard to launch it. And the fact that it requires a little bit of patience, and that it requires capital to be able to pursue an opportunity like this. So, when I look at the sales metrics at the micro level, and we just sum it up. And we look at the people we're bringing in, and what they're achieving and the growth in NPS scores just mechanically, it lays out to a good result and a good time period. Now, when does it become obvious to everybody that it is going in the right direction, it's not this year. It would be - it's difficult for me to tell when it becomes obvious that it's working, but it's probably next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. You may proceed.
Ashish Sabadra: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The core bookings were down 34% in the quarter. They're being down 38% year-to-date. How should we think about the impact of weak bookings going into next year? And how do we think about the puts and takes, to help offset that headwinds from the vehicle booking?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So inevitably, in a subscription business, net bookings ultimately translate into revenue in the following year. And so, it's fairly mechanical that we - at the third quarter, we have our net bookings, they're sort of in the ground and they'll roll forward to 2025. I think what Andy has talked about, is getting the sales force reengaged, but also investing in the sales force. So really pay attention to net bookings in 4Q, 1Q, 2Q of next year, which will then roll into a '26 growth. So again, I think it's a mechanical exercise. We have three quarters in the ground. You can roll it forward, but really pay attention to our net bookings over the coming quarters, to really get - line of sight on the second half of '25 growth into '26.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Rich Simonelli for any closing remarks.
Andrew Florance: I'm actually going to grab those closing remarks from Rich. So I should...
Rich Simonelli: Yes.
Andrew Florance: So, I just want to thank everyone for joining us on this earnings call. I look forward to updating you shortly here. If you have any additional questions following the call, please reach out to our very musically talented IR professional Rich Simonelli at getrich@costar.com. Thank you for joining us. Look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-23 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and thank you for standing by. Welcome to this Q2 2024 CoStar Group Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand it over to the Head of Investor Relations, Cyndi Eakin. Please proceed.
Cyndi Eakin: Thank you, Carmen. Good evening and thank you all for joining us to discuss the second quarter 2024 results of the CoStar Group.

Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group's press release issued earlier today and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on the information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are shown in detail in our press release issued today, along with definitions for those terms.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being webcast and the link is also available on our website under Investors. Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Cindy. Cindy I would note that that was the most upbeat reading of the preamble I've heard ever would suggest to me that you are looking forward to turning over your duties. So, good evening and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's second quarter earnings call. Second quarter 2024 revenue was $678 million, a 12% increase year-over-year, coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range and in line with consensus estimates. Our two billion dollar businesses continue to deliver double-digit year-over-year revenue growth with Apartments.com growing 18% and CoStar growing 10%. Company net new bookings were $67 million in the second quarter with 79% of our net new bookings coming from sales of our commercial real estate products and 21% from net new bookings of Homes.com memberships. Adjusted EBITDA was $41 million, which was well ahead of our guidance of $5 million to $10 million and consensus estimates of $10 million. Our commercial margins remained strong, delivering over 40% in the quarter and are expected to expand throughout the remainder of the year. Our average monthly unique visitors to our global websites reached a record of 183 million in the second quarter, according to Google Analytics, which is up 81% over the prior year. The Homes.com network delivered 148 million average monthly unique visitors for the second quarter, according to Google Analytics, which was an increase of 73% over the same quarter last year. Our Homes.com site alone delivered 99 million average monthly unique visitors for the quarter, an increase of 197% -- 197% over the same quarter a year ago according to Google Analytics. We believe that complete site-centric census style tool, like Google Analytics is more accurate than user-centric panel estimate counts generated by firms such as comScore or SEMRush. I believe tools like Google Analytics are like an election result, whereas a tool like SEMRush or comScore is more like an election poll. If I have the election results, I choose to report those rather than the sample poll result. Our leading competitors in the U.S. residential portal space combined and report traffic associated with home sales, home rentals, rural homes, land sales, and apartment rentals in their traffic numbers. For that reason, I believe the most accurate and best apples-to-apples comparison is comparing the traffic from our homes network of sites to the reported traffic of these three leading competitors. Our Homes.com network includes our sites with home sales, home rentals, rural homes, land sales, and apartment rentals. The most recent reported traffic numbers we have for the leading residential portal competitors is from their first quarter results, so the comparison is not perfect. Our reported Homes.com network traffic of 148 million average monthly unique visitors for the second quarter is fast approaching Zillow's first quarter report traffic of 217 million average monthly unique visitors. The Homes network now has solidly lapped Realtors' reported first quarter 70 million average monthly unique visitors and has thrice lapped, Redfin's reported first quarter 49 million monthly unique visitors. These solid traffic numbers far exceed our traffic performance expectation for this quarter early in the development of the new Homes.com. The second quarter was our first full quarter of selling Homes.com memberships and since mid-February, we have sold over $55 million in net new bookings. The first four full months selling Homes.com far exceeds the launch sales pace of any of our prior product launches. By comparison, it took two years after launch of Apartments.com to accumulate the level of net new bookings that Home has achieved in its first full four months of sales. The solid bookings numbers are exceptional for this early in development of the new Homes.com. We now have 10,200 member agents on the platform and 86% are on 12-month contracts. Marketing efforts continue to be successful, delivering almost 10 billion consumer impressions and 21,000 commercial placements since we launched the product. This is across broadcast, cable TV, streaming audio and video, digital and social media, and high-profile sponsorships. Unaided brand awareness continues to increase and is now at 27%, up from our prelaunch baseline of 4%. Over the past month or so, I attended focus groups with agents and consumers in Atlanta, Chicago, Irvine, and Nashville. Our growth in unaided awareness was clear. Agents reiterate that they prefer our business model of your listing, our lead, your listing, your lead, definitely, your listing, your lead. We have more work to do to make them aware of that preferred business model, and we'll do that work. In each session, the moderator asked agents and consumers to spend a few minutes using the Homes.com site. The response was fantastic. The overwhelming majority of participants said that Homes.com is the better home search site than competing sites. Common themes were that the site is clean, it's beautiful, ad-free, has more information than other sites have, has all the information you need in one spot, and participants like that the listing agent is clearly visible is not obscured and a listing agent who knows the most about the property can be readily reached to ask quick and simple questions of. Agents responded very well to our value proposition and two agents really stood out to me as they raved about how much value they were getting from their Homes.com membership. They stated that they were using the advantage as Homes.com membership offered to win more exclusive listings. So, I'd like to quote one Chicago participant named Laura. She said, "a couple of months ago, I became a premier agent on Homes.com. My listing that I used to get 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 views, I now get like 2 million views on my listings. And it's a listing tool, she went on to say, so that she can then say the seller, well, go up and look up Orland Park, and I'll show up first if I've got a listing there." And so then as she goes on to say, I say to the seller, my listing has 2 million views. Look at every other one after that, and they've got like 3,000, 4,000 views and I've got 2 million views. I'm like #winning." She goes on to say, "it's a listing tool. So, when a seller asks what are you going to do differently than everyone's else, most people will be saying the same things. And then I can say, Homes.com pull up a neighborhood and I show up first. Becca, an agent from California said something similar. She said, "Homes.com has been great for me as a listing agent. I've had -- I'm having calls directly on my listings. I have a paid subscription where it puts my information in front of buyers who are calling me directly. "In my actual listing presentation, she goes on to say, I do have marketing information about getting 60x more views on my listings since I'm a pro member on Homes.com and I think that has helped me secure listings." This was the first platform she says that I had enough confidence in that I actually paid for a Pro membership. Another agent from Columbia, South Carolina said, "within two days of signing up for my Homes.com membership, I secured a new listing that went under contract less than a week." Another agent from Spokane, Washington said, "Since I've joined Homes.com I've watched the amount of traffic on my listening increased 30 times to 40 times compared to us getting anywhere else." We built an analysis, actually Terry Rogers and team built an analysis, to understand the advantage member agents were having in winning new listings as compared to non-member agents. We create cohorts of members based upon the city, tier size they're in, the number of listings they had at the beginning of the study period, and the average list price of their listings. We compared members new listing win count to non-members wins for each month from March through June. This created a total of 192 cohorts, 192 cohorts. On average, members won 51% more new listings than did non-members. More importantly to me, in 95% of the 192 cohorts members outperformed non-member agents. This is very important and the core point. Winning new listings is a primary objective for real estate agents. We believe that the evidence is overwhelming that our product is enabling agents to achieve that core goal. We believe that the potential ROI for member agents is phenomenal. The average agent is getting 17 million annualized impressions for their listing and profile on Homes.com. Member listings get 46 times more exposure on average than non-member listings. Another analysis we ran indicated that on average, member agents are 20% more likely to sell the home in the first 10 days than non-members and members are getting on average $11,000 more for a home. That second analysis will vary from time-to-time, but multiple analyses have each shown a benefit for members over non-members in selling homes. So, in summary, I believe the product is a winner. As of today, we've only demoed approximately 3.5% of residential agents. Building a dedicated Homes.com sales team is the key driver to future Homes.com revenue growth. We have 63 dedicated Homes.com salespeople in production that I can see. We have an additional 53 in training and another 30 hired. We have been borrowing resources from our Apartments.com, CoStar LoopNet, and other sales teams to supplement the Homes.com sales team. But those borrowed sales resources will inevitably return to selling their core products as they should. Growing the Homes.com sales force must be our top priority. OnTheMarket, our U.K. residential real estate portal is making great progress. Listings on the platform are now up to 716,000, an increase of 41% from June of 2023. Average monthly visits for the month of June were 35 million, up 78% compared to June 2023 and average monthly unique visitors were up to 18 million in June or an increase of 118% over June 2023 according to Google Analytics. Lead counts are up 50% over the second quarter of last year and the sales results are looking good. A recent article from a site a publication called the Negotiator, said that a leading lead management platform has found that OnTheMarket has now overtaken Zoopla for engaged inquiries. Apartments.com continued its positive momentum with another strong quarter. Revenue was $264 million for the second quarter of 2024, representing 18% growth over the same period a year ago. We continue to add new customers with rentals of all sizes to our marketplace at a rapid pace and now have almost 76,000 paying communities on our network. In June, we had a record number of single-family rental listings represent an increase of 108% over the prior year. Single-family rental listings have boosted lead count by more than 4 times our Homes.com membership agents. Our mid-market efforts are contributing thousands of new properties, growing paid subscribers by almost 22% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. New construction is also contributing to subscriber growth with 75% of all new 100-plus unit communities advertising with Apartments.com. That's a great stat. Our sales team continues to deliver exceptional results and extremely high engagement with our clients and prospects. During the quarter, Paige's team conducted over 187,000 quality meetings, which is an increase of 23% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our second quarter Net Promoter Score of 94 continues to lead the industry or just about any industry, which is a testament to the quality of the sales team and their service. We continue to outperform our competitors and lead quality and conversion. In the second quarter, Market Connections, a third-party market research firm, conducted a survey of industry decision-makers responsible for 18,000 communities with over 1.5 million units under management. Apartments.com continues to lead all the metrics that matter to most -- matter most to multifamily owners and property managers. We're number one in advertiser usage and deliver the highest quality leads. We continue to have the highest lead-to-lease conversion rate, significantly outperforming our next closest competitor in every one of these three metrics. Our 2024 Apartments.com marketing campaign featuring Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, the inventor of the Apartminternet is in full swing again. We are reaching renters across all media channels during peak rental season and generating over 2.1 billion media impressions. This year, we launched a dedicated landlord campaign to generate awareness with landlords owning one to four rental properties and have generated almost $500 million brand media impressions to-date. As a result of our continued investment and success our unaided brand awareness, specifically attributed to apartment seekers, is now 74% compared to Zillow, which is only at 42%, 74% compared to 42%. Our average monthly unique visitors for the quarter grew 3% year-over-year to 48 million, significantly outperformed the overall market, which was down 3% year-over-year according to Google. Economic conditions in the apartment industry continue to create a favorable advertising environment. Apartment vacancy rates of 3, 4, 5-star properties, continued elevated levels with a 9.3% vacancy rate at the end of the quarter and are forecasted to remain at or above 9% for the remainder of this year. Unit level deliveries continued at all-time highs and are expected to be 561,000 units in 2024. Supply will continue to outweigh demand in the foreseeable future. Apartments.com continues to deliver strong growth and we expect to see Apartments.com revenue growth of 17% for the year, in line with our guidance. In the second quarter, CoStar continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth with $253 million of revenue, a 10% increase over the prior year and in line with our guidance. Our lender product had the highest net new sales quarter ever, with a 47% increase in revenue over the same period last year. We now have 298 banks and lending institutions in the platform, up 50% year-over-year with sales to several large institutions in the quarter. We believe that our product is superior to the competition, which is something we continue to hear from our customers. Lender is a $300 million market opportunity with 3,000 more significant lending institutions to pursue. The STR sales team had another strong quarter with a 54% increase in net new sales year-over-year. Revenue from our benchmarking product and CoStar subscriptions to hospitality clients increased 28% in the second quarter. We are well-positioned to penetrate this $300 million market opportunity with a best-in-class product. Our consistent strong revenue and sales performance for CoStar is the result of a steady stream of product innovation that delivers expanded capabilities and increase customer value. Over the past few years, we've integrated the STR benchmarking product, enhanced our fund data, added hospitality and CMBS data, launched a new lender product, and opened international reach for our CoStar customers. At the event of Q2, we just released our newest feature called Owner. The new Owner module of CoStar provides unparalled insight into the underlying portfolios of the world's largest real estate developers and owners, their key tenants acquisition and disposition trends, aggregate vacancies and availabilities in key context. Our usage data continues to show that these customers are engaging with the platform more despite the economic cycle. Our customers logged in 5 million times in the quarter and conducted 68 million property searches, up 8% over the same period a year ago. Renewal rates are up to 92% and our NPS scores are at 65%, which is the highest levels in our history for NPS for CoStar. We've grown our subscriber base to 230,000 CoStar professional users, which is up 19% year-over-year. We have a proven track record of growth throughout economic cycles and even in the face of historically low CRE transaction levels, CoStar is delivering solid growth and continues to be the mission-critical data and information product for brokers, owners, lenders, tenants, fund managers, and other participants in commercial property information markets. LoopNet revenue was $70 million, up 7% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our 5% to 6% guidance. International revenue grew 17% in the second quarter year-over-year. The LoopNet network remains the number one platform in the market with 6 times the traffic of our nearest competitor. Average monthly unique visitors for the second quarter were 13 million with direct and organic traffic at 75% of total traffic. Even considering the difficult commercial real estate market conditions, total detailed listing views are up 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. As the market normalizes over the coming years, LoopNet is poised to benefit significantly from that recovery. We continue to enhance all aspects of sales and client service. As a result, our NPS scores have improved to 58 or up 87% since last year. We're growing our dedicated sales team, which will help us further penetrate this large and global market opportunity. Real Estate Manager revenue was up 9% year-over-year with renewal rates at 99%. Real Estate Manager continues to take market share from legacy competitors. Two-thirds of our customers are sharing their lease data for anonymized analysis, which will greatly enhance our analytics in the CoStar platform. Land.com revenue grew 5% year-over-year, Signature Ads increased 9% in the second quarter, and Diamond Ad sales were up 10-fold in the last quarter. Land.com is exclusive sponsor of a new show in production, Ranchland, which will stream on Paramount Plus and CBS, featuring aspirational ranches that are listed for sale on Land.com. Each episode will feature an aspirational ranch currently on the market and listed on Land.com and will feature a day in the life of the ranch owner. I know none of you are going to want to miss that exciting show. BizBuySell revenue increased 6% year-over-year. The platform had a record $2 billion in enterprise value that transacted in the second quarter. Our franchise directory leads are up 25% and listing leads are up 16% over the same period last year. Providing these quality leads to our customers and having customer response rates in the mid-19s, correlates directly to our NPS score rising 15% to 55% this quarter. Our Ten-X platform continues to outperform the market with a trade rate of 50%, more than double the offline trade rate of 23%. We brought 57% more assets to the platform in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2024. CRE transaction volumes may be bottoming out with sales activity increasing slightly 6% year-over-year for the first time since the second quarter of 2022. To stress, sales are beginning to service, particularly for office and multifamily, but remain historically low, with lenders still preferring to extend loans. CMBS delinquency rates remain elevated and office delinquencies have increased notably to 7.4%. This is a significant opportunity as these properties will eventually need to change hands and Ten-X is the most efficient way to execute commercial real estate transactions. I believe that the results this quarter demonstrate the strength of our commercial real estate business with continued double-digit growth and strong EBITDA margins in the face of economic headwinds. I believe that this quarter, Homes.com is coming into focus as a better product with a better business model than our competitors have. I think that Homes.com value proposition is emerging clearly, it's compelling, and offers our future clients a huge potential ROI. Going forward, we need to focus on the blocking and tackling of building out our sales and marketing organization to realize the full revenue potential of Homes.com. At this point, I'm pleased to welcome our new CFO, Chris Lown, and will turn the call over to him, and here we go.
Chris Lown: Great. Thank you, Andy. Good evening. I'm excited to be here for my first of many CoStar earnings calls. I'm happy to report that CoStar has now reached its 53rd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, coming in at 12%, and we achieved a commercial business margin of 41% in the second quarter. Looking first at our Residential businesses. Residential revenue came in at $26 million, up 40% sequentially. In just four and a half months, we have delivered cumulative net new bookings of $55 million, which is a great accomplishment. We are focused on hiring dedicated Homes.com sales reps over the next year, who are more productive at selling homes memberships and will also allow many of our commercial sales teams to return to selling their core products full time. As Andy mentioned, focus groups have bolstered our confidence in our Homes.com offering and we are confident in our differentiated business model and our ability to capture this exciting long-term revenue and data opportunity. We now expect third quarter Residential revenue to come in around $30 million and we are revising our full year 2024 Residential revenue guidance to $105 million to $110 million. For the full year, we continue to expect to execute on our Homes.com investment plans. Apartments.com's second quarter revenue growth came in at 11%. The Apartments.com team continued to perform well with the highest number of sales reps and the highest sales productivity of any brand in the company. We are on track to achieve the guidance we provided last quarter, resulting in 17% year-over-year revenue growth. CoStar revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance and we are maintaining our previous full year guidance of 10% growth. We expect growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with the full year. LoopNet revenue grew 7% in the second quarter, slightly ahead of our 5% to 6% guidance range. We are maintaining our full year revenue outlook for LoopNet of mid-single-digit growth. Revenue from Information Services was flat sequentially and dropped 20% year-over-year due to the transition of STR into CoStar. We are reiterating our previously stated guidance of $130 million to $135 million for the full year and expect the third quarter to be consistent with the first two quarters of 2024. Other Marketplaces revenue was $31 million in the second quarter and we are maintaining our guidance for Other Marketplaces to be relatively flat in the third quarter and full year. From a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $41 million at a 6% margin, meaningfully above the high end of our $5 million to $10 million second quarter guidance. The favorable performance relates primarily to slower-than-anticipated hiring as well as the timing of investment spend. We anticipate incurring some of the spend in the second half of the year. Our sales force totaled some 1,240 people at quarter end, an increase of 7% year-over-year and around 30 salespeople hire sequentially. Most of the increase in the second quarter was in our Homes.com sales force. Our contract renewal rate was 90% for the second quarter, with the renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer at 95%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the second quarter, consistent with the prior quarter and the second quarter of 2023. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with $4.9 billion in cash, which are net interest income of $53 million in the second quarter, a 5.1% rate of return. Our full year 2024 revenue guidance is now in the $2.735 billion to $2.745 billion range, a 12% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. This range reflects our adjusted Residential revenue guidance for the second quarter -- second half of the year. The company expects third quarter revenue of $692 million to $697 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year with revised guidance of $195 million to $205 million. For the third quarter of 2024, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $47 million to $52 million. I will now turn the call back over to our call, operator, Carmen, to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question, please and it comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please proceed.
Peter Christiansen: Thank you. Good evening. Welcome Chris, great to have you. Congratulations for the shout out to Rich. Good evening Andy. Lots of salutations there, anyway. Andy, it sounds like -- however, the momentum in the new sales for the resi side, it seems to have hit a bit of a speed bump. It sounds a bit more like blocking and tackling on the sales force. Can you talk about adjusting the sales force to sell, who normally sell to institutional clients, how they're selling to residential agents? And I just need to follow-up. There's a notion that there's been either refunds or cancels throughout the quarter, is it a function of the agent out there just becoming more educated on what Homes.com provides and how it differs versus other portals? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So, I think that the broad sales force of 1,000-some people can comfortably sell the Homes.com product. However, they -- if you're an Apartment salesperson or CoStar salesperson, you've been selling those products for many years and after the initial rush of selling a new product, you begin to migrate back to your existing product. And it's the type of thing that you can try to push them into the two products, but realistically, longer term as you move into the second -- as we move forward towards the second full quarter, the third or fourth full quarter, we want to be relying more and more on a dedicated Homes.com selling team because there's just a natural instinct for the broad sales force to go back into their core products. The other thing is that the Homes.com team -- dedicated sales team does a better job with following up with the sales post sales and has higher Net Promoter Scores, dramatically higher Net Promoter Scores than do the salespeople that we're borrowing from the other products and who were basically renting. Have you ever treat a rental car, not as well as you treat your own car. Well, that's a little bit the way these other -- non -- the core sales forces treat some of the Homes folks -- Homes clients. And not in a bad way, it's just that the Homes.com dedicated team has a significantly higher NPS. So, -- and you don't want to -- we have some great products there with Apartments and Homes and you don't really want to push too hard to move them into a sales area there, that is not their long-term focus. So, in terms of -- I'm unaware of any refunds that we put out there. We did have a -- going into the new product, we had a completely lenient canceled policy in the initial time period. So, you could pretty much back out any time you want. It's my understanding that initially one of the single biggest reasons for cancellation is the credit card didn't process, which is not to be -- which is not unusual given residential agents with volumes down and commission-to-commission -- 100% commission-based pay. Now, there's a little bit of the ladder that you're talking about there, which is after two decades of agents being used to buying leads off of lead diversion sites in order to get buyer agency, there is definitely an education process. So, if I am an agent who doesn't really do normal residential real estate listings, I don't normally win listings as an agent, and I've been buying leads from a lead diversion site like Realtor, those sites are scraping the listing leads off of 100% of the agents and funneling them down to a small group of people that are just trying to work those buyer agency leads. We do something very different. We don't do those sort of mass scrape selling buyer agency leads. We focus on giving agents an advantage in selling their owners' home. And so we're giving them dramatically more exposure for their listings on our site and that helps them win new sale listing leads or exclusive listings. And it also helps them win buyer agency. It helps them win general branding and branding for the firm. But if you evaluate it through the lens of buyer agency scrape lead generation, it won't really meet your needs. So, there were a bunch of buyer agency only folks who are looking for something a little bit different upfront and now we don't really focus on those folks. We really direct our energy into people who have listings and the feedback is becoming better and better and better and better and it's really quite good because folks who are using it -- using Homes.com are winning 51% more listings. And if you think about what that means, it means everything. Winning a new listing is much more valuable than winning a buyer agency lead. A significant percentage of buyer agency leads never transact. A super high percentage of listings homes for sale will transact and transact quickly. And with all the things going on in the world, with the NAR, with the lawsuits, and the whole plaintiff lawsuits, the sale listing generation is a safe harbor in that storm and so agents prefer that. So, long, short of it is, yes, we had an incredibly -- just anytime you want to cancel, which is not what we normally do, we're past that, and we're redirecting and making sure that we're not -- we're educating people on, this is not a lead stealing site, this is a promoting the home and allowing agents to win listings and generally build their brand and win by our agency leads. Pete was that a long answer?
Peter Christiansen: It was good color. I'm going to -- we're going to take that in. Very good. Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please and it's from the line of Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Alexei Gogolev: Hi Andy and hi Chris. Welcome to the new role. I wanted to ask a quick question about the new guidance for the resi business. So, as I see it, you're now assuming roughly $4 million sequential increase of resi revenue in 3Q and then another $3 million or $5 million in the 4Q quarter, which is slightly different to the $10 million sequential increase that you were initially targeting. Just wondering what drove that decision to lower the guidance? And what is your feel around the membership additions that you're seeing at the moment?
Chris Lown: Sure. Thank you for the question. I think a couple of things. Obviously, this was the launch of a new product and there is a lot of brainpower going into -- trying to model out that analysis and what will happen and the initial results were very strong, and therefore, there was a reaction to that. I think what you're seeing now is more of a growing momentum that you'll see evolve over time and while we don't provide quarterly guidance, your numbers make broad sense to me. And so I think what you're seeing is, probably a more appropriate build of the business, hopefully a conservative build of the business. And therefore, I think it's a just a better understanding. I would also highlight as a new launch. As Andy had mentioned, compared to Apartments.com launch, this is phenomenally more successful. And I think we feel good about that and the model outlay and so as Andy said, we are hyper focused on getting Homes.com salespeople in their seats and that momentum will drive further growth as well.
Andrew Florance: And again, I would just add that the main issue is rotation of the core sales force back into their core products by their own choice largely and then now you move into the more long-term, as Chris says, into the long-term growth of the core sales group. And definitely a significant number the other product sales groups will keep selling homes because they want to, but you'll be relying on the growth of that dedicated sales force now.
Alexei Gogolev: Understood. Thank you. Andy. And Chris, just a quick follow-up on the exit rate EBITDA margin target. Would you mind confirming if it's still 15% to 16%?
Chris Lown: Within that range, yes.
Alexei Gogolev: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and it comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I'd also like to extend the welcome to Chris, and thanks to Cyndi. So, I want to stick with the Residential business because it sounds like you're seeing good traction with respect to online traffic and bookings and yet you're reducing your full year residential revenue guide by about $20 million to $25 million. It sounds like some of that better appreciation of the trajectory and perhaps some sales force productivity insights. But just want to elaborate, if you can on what's changed? Is it a function of hiring capacity with respect to the sales force? Is it a function of the productivity of the borrowed salespeople? Or is it a function of end market demand for your product?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So, I think the number one factor is human behavior and it is the borrowed sales force, a significant number of the borrowed sales force returning to their comfort zone of selling their core products. So, if I've been selling Apartments.com for seven years and doing really quite well, at some point, I feel anxious about selling a new product that I'm not going to be selling long-term. So, it really -- the beginning, middle and end of it is really about building a dedicated sales team just like CoStar has, just like STR has, just like Real Estate Manager has, just like LoopNet has, we got to build that core sales team for Homes.com, so they can sell and service that product as their first priority. And those folks are doing well. I'm happy with the results of this relatively new sales force, we just need to keep growing it. And that will be our priority. But it is -- as I look at where we are, having the traffic that is phenomenal and having the -- both the end users prefer the product over others in our studies and having the agents signifying -- find significant value in what we're doing if they're actually in real estate, is really good, and it gives -- and now it's just a question of building out that dedicated home sales team. But I'm reluctant, and I'm reluctant to pressure high-performing apartments or CoStar or Real Estate Manager salespeople to move into homes when they're really quite good at their core products.
George Tong: Got it, that’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please and is from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Heather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. You touched on Apartments earlier in the call, it'd be great to hear your thoughts about how you see trends into next year, especially given the supply dynamics? And also, I know there's been a lot of questions on competition, [Indiscernible] have gotten more into the apartment space and you touched on some of that earlier in the call as well. Just how you're thinking about keeping your leadership position as competition increases and the differentiating factors between your business?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So, as you look at the economic environment we're operating in for Apartments.com, I do believe we are in the Goldilocks zone. So, we don't want to see vacancy rates too high. People then aren't -- don't have liquidity to pay for the ads and we don't want to see them too low because the demand for the ads go down. So, in terms of how we maintain our competitive advantage, we have a robust and broad product development line Apartments.com, you can see the traffic continue to grow. And you can see us consistently outpacing and lead to -- in lead-to-lease conversion, into unaided awareness, and the traffic growth, just all the different metrics, we're doing quite well. And really, it's sort of a broader playbook here where there's a lot of room in this space because most of the apartment units are in the smaller category and in the mom-and-pop individual units and houses. And so frankly, nobody has any real penetration there. I mean it is while we're growing down there, we're in the single-digit penetration. So, there's tons of room for us to grow in there. And you will see likely some other players grow in there, but that's because it's a big market, and we're both developing a big market.
Heather Balsky: Thank you for that. And I could have missed it, but I was just curious, can you share just updated thoughts on commercial EBITDA margin for the year? And are your expectations still the same as they've been for the prior two quarters?
Chris Lown: We did provide guidance to what we did in the second quarter of around 41% and we do expect those to slightly be roughly in the same area.
Heather Balsky: Okay, thank you. So, 41%?
Chris Lown: Correct.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please and it's from the line of Soham Bhonsle with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Soham Bhonsle: Hey good evening everyone. Thanks for taking my questions and Chris welcome. Andy, I was hoping you could touch on some of the organic levers for CoStar Suite going forward. I think last quarter, you talked about 220,000-odd subscribers, STR and the lender product being an opportunity. But I was wondering if you could maybe break that down further as we sort of think about the growth drivers of the business over the next two to three years? Thanks.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So, continuing to develop products that are geared towards the corporate user, the owner, the lender institutions, that's a wide open area with relatively low penetration rates. And as we add more and more people in those other sectors or segments, it creates more energy in the customer base, brokers are more likely to engage in the product more if corporate users are engaging in the product owners are more likely to engage in the product when corporate users are in the product. So, we're building out a lot of vibrancy in the platform by going into those building features and functions to reach into the segments in which we have historically had -- had not been our first and second priorities but are huge growth areas. Also, we are continuing progress towards moving Germany, France, Spain, some other markets into CoStar, as well as our global hospitality functions. So, I believe, later this year, we'll be releasing the more full STR global functionality. So, global will be another driver. So, I think that those are the main segments. We still have a lot of way to -- I mean, as crazy as it is. All these years later, we still have a lot of brokers to sell to. And increasingly, residential firms over the last 10, 15 years have been doing more commercial. So, as we get into more and more into residential, we'll be providing more CoStar services to folks that you would have viewed as more historically residential. I had a call today with a Head of Sales of CoStar with a major residential player trying to figure out how they could get access to CoStar and LoopNet. And I don't think that call would have happened except for the fact that we're now on that CEO's radar because of Homes.com. So, CoStar Group -- I mean, sorry, CoStar remains the product with, as far as I can tell, after 38 years perpetual growth opportunity.
Soham Bhonsle: Great. And if I could just follow-up on commercial bookings in the quarter. It looks like you did improve quarter-over-quarter, but it's still down year-over-year. So, any color that you could sort of provide there when do you think that could start getting moving again? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Well, you see that in -- when you've given a fixed number of hours in the day, when those CoStar apartments, LoopNet salespeople shift over and start spending some amount of time selling Homes.com, which they did a lot in the period from February 12 into the second quarter, that comes at some substitution effect where they're selling in the core. So, I think predominantly, any reduction year-over-year is coming from that effort selling into Homes.com.
Soham Bhonsle: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and it's from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. Just -- Andy, maybe if you could just talk through kind of the key factors that are going to determine the budget for the Homes.com initiative over the next few years just with this -- the stutter in the net bookings? And then what's the exit rate assumed for ARR for Homes.com in the revenue guidance, please? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: So, I'll let Chris -- after I answer the first part, I'll let Chris answer the revenue guidance on exit ARR. So, I think that big picture, we are coming out with this Homes.com product offering in our first full quarter with a good result, which is more than, when I look at the early stages of Apartments.com, I believe we're running more than double the sales we ran Apartments.com, and it's a question of building it out. So, it's a little early in the first full quarter of launch to call it a stutter because you don't really have a reference point. So, we're -- we -- as we've said earlier, we do not anticipate growing the net investment in the product, but we do have high confidence that we are on the road to building the best site and creating substantial value, and we haven't changed our minds about this. So, we're going to continue investing at that same level. But you can see in our solid EBITDA beat this quarter, you sort of hit the NEDAR [ph] of that reinvestment period. And then, Chris, on the -- he's got the ARR question on exit.
Chris Lown: Thanks. The ARR question, we had provided previous guidance in the range of $475 million to $500 million and at the lower end of that range is where we still feel comfortable.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and it comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens. Please proceed.
John Campbell: Thanks and Chris, welcome to the CFO seat and congrats and looking forward to working with Rich again. But for Homes.com I know the unaided brand awareness metric, that's an important North Star for you guys. I think we're all trying to get a better grip on the rate of net resi investment spend in the years ahead. And so maybe just a two-part question here. So, first, should we be thinking about Homes.com reaching that 50% level is a trigger point for spend relief? And then secondly, you guys have obviously moved that unaided awareness up quickly. I mean, basically next to nothing when you acquired it. I think 27% now, took Homes.com -- excuse me, Apartments.com almost a decade to get to 50%. Obviously, you're spending multiple times more Homes.com. So, Andy, rather than ask you an exact date for Homes.com, which I wouldn't expect maybe just directionally, if you -- should we be thinking about that 50% level coming in the quarters ahead, the years ahead? Or should we be looking at that path -- Apartments.com path as a guide?
Andrew Florance: Well, I do not believe it is on the same. I believe it was going much faster and will continue to grow much faster than Apartments.com. So, we're constantly evolving the messaging just as we did with Apartments.com and fine-tuning it and shifting various value propositions out in the marketing. I would say that we anticipate similar to Apartments.com relatively constant investment as you build this out and only really increasing investment as we did with Apartments.com in the event that you can see a revenue and EBITDA financial result that's clearly attractive and can be communicated to the investors. But in building out something as valuable as the number one residential portal platform, it doesn't happen in one quarter. It is likely -- it is a multiyear effort, just like Apartments.com and CoStar. So, it is the steady, persistent, consistent, making progress down the road and don't anticipate radical changes anytime soon and don't anticipate increases that would slow EBITDA growth.
John Campbell: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you, Andy.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question and it's from the line of Nick Jones with Citizens JMP. Please proceed.
Nick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Two more on Homes.com. You've done a great job driving traffic up meaningfully. Can you speak to as you aim to get more leverage, the balance between maybe shifting focus to driving more app downloads or time on app in terms of getting maybe cheaper forms of traffic behind upper funnel advertising or social or things like that? And then I have a follow-up.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So, on the app download side, we are focused first and foremost on web mobile because that is the fastest way to collect traffic. That's the most predominant platform, it reduces friction, people aren't downloading your app to adopt a new product. So, as we're in here in the first couple of months of the new product, our design and development teams prioritize that. I'm sure you've had the experience. If you optimize everything around that web mobile platform, it's a great experience. And that's what we're hearing in the focus group from consumers is that hands down, they prefer it over app or web mobile of any of our competitors. They describe it as clean, they describe it as fast, they describe it as offering a lot more information than any other platform and they describe it as having the benefit of being able to ask the listing agent a quick question, without being hard sold by someone to something you weren't looking to buy. So, I'm sure you've been annoyed before when you're trying to look at something in a web mobile app and up pops the thing saying, okay, stop doing and go into download an app, not very popular. And when we look at numbers that our friends at Google have shared with us, they're pretty compelling and they show that competing sites are pulling de minimis traffic from their app downloads and that still everyone is predominantly competing in the web mobile environment. So, we're doing the app side, and I get it. If you can get everyone hooked on an app, you are less dependent on buying SEM traffic or less dependent organic traffic. But for everyone in the industry, it is overwhelmingly web mobile and so we're keeping up slightly behind the web mobile, we're keeping up app parallel functionality. But right now, we are basically about traffic attainment. And I am thrilled with the work our Homes product team has done and the development team has done building a fantastic web mobile. And so while we're snagging traffic from other folks, we're going on the fastest, most fluid platform, which is web mobile. In social, we're marketing anywhere and everywhere we can pull people at the most cost-effective price. So, yes, we're on -- if you can talk about digital marketing or streaming or anything social, we're on virtually everything. I'm sure you see us everywhere.
Nick Jones: I sure do. And then I guess, maybe a bigger picture question. I think earlier you alluded to maybe buyer leads are not as valuable, as getting listing leads it makes sense. But then how do you balance -- I guess, philosophically, how are you going to balance the value of the platform to essentially home buyers, which, I guess, sounds like our view is less valuable, then providing kind of upper funnel advertising for agents to go win more listings? Because over time, if the marketplace isn't balanced and you can't continue to draw home buyers, how do you continue to drive the ROIs? If the focus is really on driving listing, you follow the question, it's a little --, but I kind of heard two different comments on the call today.
Andrew Florance: So, I wouldn't hold you at fault for misinterpreting my bad formulation of the words apparently. But our first and foremost priority is to produce the best site possible for home buyers, which I believe we're doing. And so the home buyer comes first, first, and first and second, third and fourth, right? And so that's what we're doing. What we're trying -- and then -- and for sure, I firmly believe that the your listing, your lead model is preferred by sellers because when they make that important decision to hire a real estate agent to help them get the best result for selling their most important asset, their home, they want that real estate agent they hired to answer that first question for a potential lead, they don't want to go to someone who has never seen their home, knows nothing about their neighborhood. They want the seller -- they want the seller selling agent to get and that's what your listing, your lead model we have has. The agents like the your listing, your lead model because they want to get the leads off their listings. The biggest source of buyer agency leads actually comes from having listings. So, when someone calls on your sale listing, you're generating buyer leads because they are -- nine out of 10 times, they're not buying the house, they first call on. But as an agent, you can get them as a buyer agent show them other homes because you're an expert in the category in the neighborhood they're familiar with. You also get referral commissions and the leads you refer off your listings come back to you as referrals from other people's listings. What we're not doing is stealing everybody's leads and reselling them to a handful of lower-end agents. So, that does not mean that we're not creating buyer agency and we're not focusing on buyers, it means we're doing it more intelligently and we're doing it in a way that resonates with the industry long-term. And frankly, I'm really excited about the fact that I am becoming more and more confident that we have the vastly superior model. And I'm seeing one of our competitors starting to figure that out and attempting to pivot their business, which requires cannibalization of their business. And I see the other competitor not having figured out where they are and what's happening, and that's wonderful. So, we're not saying we're stepping away from buyers or buyer agency, far from it, we're just generating buyer agent more -- buyer agency more harmoniously with the way the industry has historically done it in a more sustainable advantaged way over the long-term. But thank you for giving me a chance to clarify.
Nick Jones: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that's all the time we have for Q&A today. I will pass the call back to Andy Florance for final comments.
Andrew Florance: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today for the call. And Chris, welcome aboard.
Chris Lown: Thank you.
Andrew Florance: No offense to Scott Wheeler, who I hope is listening today with a scotch in his hand, but Scott was good. Chris is clearly better, but so be it. And then Cyndi, thank you for all the calls you've done. Cyndi will be rotating to focusing in her new role as Chief Accounting Officer. And then we've gone to the bull pen and we're bringing the ever famous Rich Simonelli back to sit in the Investor Relations' seat. So, next quarter, I hope you'll be joining us, so we can update you, and we'll have Mr. Simonelli back and we'll ask him to play a brief ballot, we're going to ask them to set the preamble to music. Do you think you can do that, Rich? Thank you all for joining us. Look forward to talking to you guys next quarter.
Operator: And thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 17:00:00) =====

Andrew Florance: Good -- good evening everyone. Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's first quarter 2024 earnings call. First quarter 2024 revenue was $656 million, a 12% increase over first quarter of '23, coming in above the high-end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. Both apartments.com and CoStar surpassed the $1 billion revenue mark in the first quarter, a tremendous milestone for the company. Congratulations to both teams. Company wide net new bookings achieved an all-time high in the first quarter of $86 million fueled by a very strong launch of our Homes.com membership product. In the first quarter, 60% of our net new bookings were from sales of our commercial products and 40% were from net new bookings from our new Homes.com memberships and residential products. Overall, traffic to our global websites reached a record 170 million average monthly unique visitors in the first quarter according to Google Analytics, which is 93% above the first quarter of last year, an impressive 34% above our previous all-time high. CoStar Group has now reached 90% of the 194 million unique visitors still reported in the last earnings call. Our residential network reached a record 156 million monthly unique visitors in March according to Google Analytics. I believe we have clearly established Homes.com and our residential network as one of the two most trafficked residential marketplaces in the United States. Yesterday, we announced that we reached a definitive agreement to acquire Matterport, the global leader in immersive 3D Digital Twins and Artificial Intelligence for the real estate industry for $5.50 per share. Founded in 2011, Matterport pioneered the development of the first 3D capture solution to deliver dimensionally accurate photorealistic virtual tours or digital twins for any type of property. Matterport's proprietary and patented technology enables anyone to digitize a property using a variety of camera technologies, including cameras found on most smartphones. Matterport's 3D technology is utilized in nearly every sector of real estate, spanning residential, commercial, hospitality, retail and industrial spaces among others. Over the years, Matterport has curated what is considered the largest and most precise collection of spatial property data worldwide, with over 12 million spaces captured in 177 countries and representing more than 38 billion square feet of digital commercial property under management. Hundreds of thousands of new 3D digital twins for properties around the world are being added to this impressive database each month. Matterport makes it possible to experience real estate remotely. People now select their next home apartment, office, store, hotel or warehouse on their mobile device often without ever visiting the property. The pandemic accelerate the remote real estate shopping trend and we believe it is the new normal. CoStar Group and Matterport have nearly identical mission statements of digitizing the world's real estate. CoStar Group was one of the first adapters -- adopters of Matterport's technology and currently has almost 300,000 Matterport digital twins available in the CoStar information product and online property marketplaces. In March of this year, there were over 7.4 million views of Matterport 3D tours on Apartments.com. Visitors who interact with the Matterport on Apartments.com spend 16.6 minutes on the site, which is 134% more than the 7.1 minutes time on site if they do not interact with a Matterport. Properties with a Matterport generated 74 leads, which is 10x the seven leads generated for property without Matterport. Currently, 50% to 60% of consumers looking for an apartment say they're comfortable selecting their next apartment without visiting the property at all. As we listen to corporate real estate executives who use loop net, discussed their challenges of buying and leasing properties around the world. They tell us 3D digital twins are invaluable in facilitating technology for them. In residential focus groups, homebuyers are clearly telling us that they prefer listings that offer 3D digital twins so they can best understand the property. We believe that our substantial empirical data in our market research clearly shows that consumers and advertisers prefer real estate portals with digital twins. We intend to go all in on 3D digital twins adding more digital twins to Apartments.com, LoopNet, Homes.com. CoStar Land.com, BizBuySell, Real Estate Manager, STR Belbex on the market and others. We intend to add Matterport as one of the benefits of Homes.com membership. We believe adding 3D digital twins for Homes.com members will increase the leads we deliver, increased customer satisfaction, increased renewal rates, increase sales and increased site traffic further. We have thoroughly researched the many 3D digital twin solutions out there and have concluded that Matterport is the best solution for our client's needs. Given the fact that we intend to make a much greater commitment to capturing 3D digital twins, we decided to capture the value of our increased volumes by acquiring Matterport. We decided to capture the value of our increased volumes by acquiring Matterport. As we make Matterport's more ubiquitous, we believe others will buy more Matterport, making the company more valuable. We believe that we can accelerate Matterport sales to non CoStar Group advertisers by increasing Matterport's investments in sales and marketing. Well, Matterport has been very responsive to us as customers over the past 9 years, we see the acquisition is giving us increased ability to influence the product roadmap for Matterport to best serve our clients needs. I believe we're standing on the verge of a potential exponential acceleration in the technology surrounding 3D digital twins, which will create transformative value for real estate. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, generative AI, computational photography, NeRF, SMERF and Gaussian Splat, all have tremendous potential for real estate. Matterport has incredible research and development talent. These are the people who are very passionate about the future of digital twins and literally invented the genre. And we believe we're the -- they are the ones who will imagine and create the industry's future. Right Dave? We intend to actively support invest in Matterport spatial technology research and development efforts. Imagine the potential scan your home and move 3D digital twins of your furniture and art into a virtual moving truck and trialing it out in a potential new home virtually. Imagine using a 3D digital twin to virtually see various potential kitchen renovations in seconds. Imagine the value of creating a 3D twin of an unattractive raw office space and using generative AI to rapidly generate 3D realistic potential build outs of the office space for a future tenant to see.
Andrew Florance: Adding virtual reality to the Matterport, you can take a virtual tour of the property with your virtual agent walking to the space with you. The possibilities are certainly exciting to imagine and represent a massive opportunity to propagate new technologies to our global information and marketplace businesses. I believe CoStar Group faces two major challenges in our effort to make Homes.com the leading us real estate portal. First we need to build massive site traffic and; second, we need to successfully monetize our new your listing your lead model. As we report our first quarter results, I believe we are showing for the first time clear proof that we are very successfully delivering against those two important challenges. With almost 40 million in home's net new bookings and 156 million monthly unique visitors achieved in the quarter, we're growing revenue and traffic faster than in any other product launch in the history of the company. We launched the Homes.com brand marketing in February -- I think it was the 11th during the Super Bowl, and the results were outstanding. We believe the Homes.com marketing program is the largest in the history of real estate, delivering almost 9,000 commercial placements in the first quarter across broadcast and cable TV streaming audio and video, digital and social media and high profile sponsorships as well. In less than 2 months, our brand campaign generated almost 4.5 billion consumer impressions. Our marketing and media advertising and featuring Dan Levy, Heidi Gardner, as well as supporting roles from Jeff Goldblum and Lil Wayne, is proving effective with consumers as oh, a supporting role from yours truly Andy Florance. It's proving effective that consumers as evidenced by our unaided brand awareness, which increased from 4% in January to 24% in March of this year. With unaided awareness approaching 25% in just one quarter, we're halfway to our goal of 50% unaided consumer brand awareness for Homes.com. It will obviously work to go beyond the 50%. But 50% is a very important number. The consumer traffic response to our marketing efforts has been equally impressive. In March, the Homes.com site attracted 110 million monthly unique visitors according to Google Analytics, an increase of 386% over the same period last year. In March, monthly unique visitors to our overall residential network reached 156 million. That is pretty much U.S apartments and homes, which is basically an apples-to-apples comparison to our competitors. We believe Homes.com and our residential network continue to be the fastest growing residential market place in the U.S in terms of consumer traffic. We are also seeing quality improvements in our traffic metrics with direct traffic to Homes.com, increasing 115% Since the first quarter of last year. Sales of Homes.com memberships are off to a fantastic start. In the first quarter, our sales team sold almost 8,000 Homes.com membership subscriptions, making Homes.com product launch easily the fastest growing new product in the company history. For context, we launched Apartments.com in early 2015, and it took seven years to achieve our first quarter with 40 million annualized bookings. Homes.com reach the 40 million annualized bookings, in the first quarter we launched and it wasn't even a full quarter it was less than 2 months of selling. So as a really fast start. We're seeing a strong continuation of sales results in metrics that they mentioned in our last earnings call in February. 90% of [indiscernible] agent members were selected in the 12-month contract option, with the rest choosing the 6-month subscription. Through the end of the first quarter, the average monthly selling price of a membership was in the 475 to 500 per month range. We are signing up agent members of all sizes ranging from single agents with no listings up to large agent groups with hundreds of listings per year. We recently had a regional broker in Indianapolis sign up all 180 agents on their brokerage team. They want to enhance their marketing strategy and are excited about the Homes.com advertising opportunity to build their brand's awareness. Agent feedback has been extremely positive. An agent from Western Florida said "Homes.com has truly transformed my business with genuine leads that are directly connected potential buyers to my listings. No more confusion or wasted time. Just real quality leads that make a difference". Clearly, the your listing your lead model is resonating. Another agent from Westlake Village California said what impressed me most after I signed up was how Homes.com boosted the number of views I have compared with other listing agents in the area. Currently on average,Homes.com members listings and profiles are viewed 1.8 million times a month, or 200x more than 9,000 views a basic agent receives. Our company wide sales team of over 1,000 sales representatives is proving very effective in selling Homes.com It's still early days, but every one of our eight commercial product sales teams from the largest apartments.com to the smallest CoStar real estate manager are selling Homes.com memberships. In total, 85% of our sales representatives have successfully sold at least one Homes.com membership. We are selling memberships all over the country in major cities and markets, smaller communities and rural areas. Through last week, around 40% of our memberships were sold to agents outside the top metro areas. Looking at the roughly 70 major markets where we have a field sales presence. Every market has contributed dozens of new memberships with Dallas, leading the way in terms of total memberships and net bookings. Relative to city size Las Vegas and Columbus are the champions sales teams overall, each producing the highest net new bookings per person. It was really exciting is that our early sales success measured against our 500,000 plus agent prospect list is still only 1% penetration. This implies a total market opportunity of over 3 billion of revenue for our basic membership product. While the broader sales force has sowings Homes.com. In addition to their original product responsibility, we do expect a substitution effect and slightly lower sales for these non-homes products. As we build up a dedicated homes sales team, the non home sales teams will return more of their time to their original products. Our new VP of home sales, Andy Stearns is focused on building out our Homes.com dedicated Salesforce in Richmond, Virginia, with a goal of having over 300 sellers in place by the end of the year. The first 80 or so members of this team are proving very effective, turning in more Homes.com net bookings per person that companywide average after only 30 to 60 days with a company. Overall, I’m very pleased with our results and momentum from the first 60 days, since the launch of Homes.com marketing and sales efforts. I want to comment on our perception of the impact of recent class action lawsuits in the real estate industry. We are not experts. We're not involved, but it clearly is going to have some impacts in the industry. While Homes.com relies on a your listing, your lead model that focuses on selling the home as the highest priority, our competitors use a lead diversion model that focuses on generating buyer agency leads as their highest priority. We are not aware of any other portal in the world that uses such a lead diversion model the way our U.S. competitors do. Our competitors present agents listings with a contact agent button that diverts the leads away from that agent who's listing it is to one of their competitors who's listing it's not. We believe that the lead diversion model is very unpopular with home sellers, agents, buyers and brokers, which may be why it has not been very profitable. With recent seismic legal settlements in the real estate industry, we believe the portals that rely on the lead diversion models could become stressed. Legacy portals rely on MLS data feeds that provide them with information on offers to compensation to buyer, brokers so these portals can take a significant portion of the buyer-broker commission from the diverted leads. Going forward, under the terms of the settlement, those feeds can no longer include buyer-broker compensation fields. In addition, buyer agents will need to get buyers to enter into a written agreement, a written buyer agency agreement before they even show the buyers a house for sale. It may be difficult for the diversion model agents to get homebuyers to sign a written commitment to the agent just to see one house. Currently, only 30% of buyer agents ever get a written agreement at any point in the transaction process. In contrast, Homes.com connects homebuyers with directly the listing agent so they can arrange to see the house with no paperwork or commitments. We are increasingly confident in our ability to build out the #1 residential marketplace in terms of traffic, revenue and profitability in the years ahead. Our U.K. property portal, OnTheMarket, is off to a strong start in the first quarter. Coming into the quarter before we acquired OnTheMarket, it was a distant third place in the U.K. based on traffic. We have made a focused and successful effort to grow OnTheMarket market traffic. In March, according to similar web reporting, we surpassed Zoopla in site visits and are now the U.K.'s #2 residential property portal. Monthly unique visitors were 17 million in March, representing a 107% increase over the same period a year ago according to Google Analytics. The increase in traffic has translated to nearly 50% more leads for agents in March of 2024 versus the prior year. The early results tell us we are delivering on our strategy of investing and partnering with agents to generate high-intent leads at a fraction of the cost of competing U.K. portals. In response to the strategy, more and more agents are choosing to put their listings on the market. In March, we exceeded 15,000 advertisers on the portal and have grown listings almost 40% year-over-year. Apartments.com reached a significant milestone in the first quarter with annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $255 million, representing 21% growth compared to the first quarter of 2023 and above our guidance growth rate of 20%. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter with Apartments.com growing at or above 20%. I believe the continuing success story of Apartments.com is a tribute to the quality of the product, the effectiveness of our brand marketing and our ability to build the largest and most effective sales force in the industry. Three weeks ago on April 1, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of CoStar's acquisition of Apartments.com and what an amazing 10 years it's been. We transformed the way consumers find their next rental home growing our revenue from $75 million in 2014 to over $1 billion today. Our sales team is 5x larger, delivering 3,225% more sales than when we started. We went from fourth or fifth place in that industry in terms of traffic to the #1 traffic position with the brand most recognized by consumers. I would like to personally congratulate Fred, Paige, Jerry and the entire Apartments.com team for this outstanding success. And I'm looking forward to the next 10 years. providing the best possible rental experience for consumers and our advertising customers. And Fred, I'm looking for another tenfold increase plus in revenue, at least 12-fold increase. So good luck. Our 2024 marketing campaign is off to a great start. We kicked off with a fantastic Super Bowl ad during the most viewed Super Bowl game in history. The campaign generated over 2.3 billion media impressions in the first quarter of 2024, which is 3x the number of impressions delivered in the first quarter of last year. We launched five new television commercials featuring Brad Bellflower, the inventor of the Apartminternet, known to many of you as Jeff Goldblum. We expect this year's campaign to deliver our highest number of impressions ever over 12 billion while reaching 90% of renters across the U.S. Our brand marketing strategy continues to pay dividends, and our first quarter unaided brand awareness was 51%, which has outperformed Zillow's unaided brand awareness for 4 quarters in a row. Apartments.com continues to be the most highly trafficked rental website in the U.S., attracting over 43 million monthly unique visitors on average in the first quarter according to Google Analytics. According to Comscore, unique visitors in the first quarter of 2024 were relatively flat over the same period last year, which is quite the opposite of our competitors, with Zillow decreasing 13% and rent period down 21%. In addition, as Homes.com traffic grows, Apartments.com benefits from consumers that want to explore rental options. Monthly unique visitors sourced through Homes.com grew 21% in March year-over-year according to Comscore. With both Apartments and Homes' products to sell, the sales team conducted 189,000 quality meetings in the first quarter, an increase of 38% over the first quarter of last year. These efforts are clearly producing results as properties advertising on our platform reached an all-time high of 73,000 at the end of the quarter, while the number of under 50 unit properties advertising increased 31% over the prior period. It's important to keep in mind that despite such strong growth in advertisers and revenue, we remain below 12% penetration in the Apartments.com market opportunity, which we estimate to be worth $9 billion. Overall, economic conditions remain favorable for rental property advertising. Vacancy levels continue to set record highs for 3, 4 and 5 star properties, increasing 10 basis points above the fourth quarter of 2023 to reach 9.1%. New unit deliveries remain at elevated levels, with 495,000 units expected to be delivered in 2024 coming off the peak of 583,000 units that were delivered in 2023. CoStar revenue was $250 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the same quarter a year ago. Our [indiscernible] information product reached a significant milestone in the first quarter, just like Apartments.com did, but Apartments got there a month earlier. CoStar Group reached an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. So just to be keeping track, that's two of our products cross the $1 billion revenue run rate in the quarter. In other way, saying both CoStar and Apartments crossed $1 billion revenue run rate in the quarter. Regardless of economic cycles, we continue to see strong revenue growth in CoStar. The 20-year compound annual growth rate for CoStar is an impressive 12%, which we expect to continue for years to come. Our lender product delivered revenue growth of 57% in the first quarter year-over-year. The number of banks and lending institutions on our lender platform is now 285, an increase of 71% year-over-year. We are still in the early stages of what we believe to be a $300 million-plus revenue opportunity for our lender product. The CoStar hospitality product, STR, has experienced some of the fastest sales growth in the company, increasing 44% in the first quarter. Revenue from our benchmarking and CoStar subscriptions to hospitality clients increased 15% in the first quarter. Our CoStar sales force team -- our CoStar sales team force delivered the strongest sales of Homes.com in the quarter and their highest level of total net new bookings output since '22. CoStar renewal rates remain above 90%, and our NPS scores continue to grow. We now have 221,000 subscribers in the CoStar platform and they logged in 5.2 million times in the first quarter, with 24 million property searches conducted and a 17% increase compared to the prior year. So CoStar Group is robust, healthy and growing. LoopNet revenue was $69 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 9% over the first quarter of last year. The international revenue in the first quarter was up 29% compared to the first quarter of last year. LoopNet continues to be the leading commercial marketplace in the U.S., with over 13 million monthly average unique visitors according to Google Analytics. Our direct and organic traffic represents over 70% of average monthly unique visitors, which is a testament to our brand as we continue to generate quality leads for customers. We continue to enhance our sales capabilities and are seeing positive sales trends coming out of first quarter. Net new bookings increased 147% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The net sales per sales representatives, including Homes.com sales, was the highest of any period since we launched a dedicated sales force almost 18 months ago. The quality level of interactions with customers is also improving, with the LoopNet sales team Net Promoter Score increasing 70% from the same period a year ago. We welcomed Ben Drew to the President of LoopNet role this past week. Ben brings over two decades of digital marketplace and leadership experience, most recently, Ben served as President of Viator, the leading marketplace for travel experiences. Prior to Viator, Ben held roles with increasing levels of responsibility at TripAdvisor, the parent company of Viator. Even though commercial real estate trends -- commercial real estate sales transactions, volumes dropped 17% in the first quarter, the lowest level since beginning of the pandemic, Ten-X outperformed the market with an 8% increase in assets brought to the platform in the first quarter. The Ten-X trade rate increased from 48% in the fourth quarter of '23 to 56% in the first quarter of '24. The average number of bidders per auction was 3.2 this quarter, which was the highest number in a year and above the fourth quarter average of 2.3 per auction -- bidders per auction. Our approval rates of allowing proposed assets to trade in the platform increased as well in the first quarter, up 50% from the prior quarter, a good sign of improvement. Looking at the real estate economy, office sector vacancies now stood at 13.8% and have risen 19 consecutive quarters. Office attendance has shown a positive trend of 2% to 3% over the past year, but that is currently counterbalanced by declining overall office using job growth. But the true silver lining is construction levels with the current supply pipeline at the lowest level it's been in 10 years and construction starts this quarter, the lowest ever. This will likely translate into a shortage of premium office space and associated price premiums in the coming years. Be a good time to buy an office building. The industrial sector saw a 90% drop in demand in the first quarter compared to the average of the past 3 years. Deliveries in the quarter pushed vacancies up 50 basis points to 6.2%, the highest level since 2015. Retail vacancies remained largely unchanged in the first quarter, near the all-time low of 4%. In the residential sector, mortgage rates are still high enough to keep most Americans from listing their homes for sale, which is propping up home prices and impacting affordability. The recent decline in mortgage rates created positive momentum in sales, increasing affordability and increasing existing home sales to 500,000 homes a month. If rates continue to drop, we could see a significant increase of activity in the residential sector. So we've had a lot of good news to share with this quarter, but I think the most important news is that the early indications of the Homes.com investment is working. We are proving out our ability to generate traffic on Homes.com clearly. We are building the brand, and we are monetizing the site. We believe that before too long, Homes.com will be our largest revenue business in the portfolio. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, who seems to be sort of fading away. Go ahead, Scott.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I'll try to remain present for the next 10 or 20 minutes. Well, that was a great start to the year. I wish we could have a quarter like that every year. That's a pretty amazing highlight reel that you shared for the company, with the 3D groundbreaking acquisition and $1 billion businesses, the best product launch ever with Homes, record sales, the Super Bowl marketing launch, you even managed to wiggle in the word Gaussian Splat into your script, which -- it's a real word people, that wasn't a joke. You can look it up. So how are we going to top that in the second quarter? I don't know, but we better get going because we got a lot to do. So our streak of double-digit revenue growth continued in the first quarter at 12% overall for the company. And you know what I think the best news is here, it's our Residential business is now making a solid positive contribution to growth. After 2 years, we've endured this sort of painful revenue decline from the legacy Residential products like this quarterly drip, drip, drip, revenue erosion like water torture, while we are finally on the upswing with the launch of Homes.com monetization. Our Residential revenue came in at $19 million in the first quarter, which was up 90% sequentially from the fourth quarter of '23 and up 42% year-over-year, thanks to our Homes.com launch and a full quarter of OnTheMarket results. First quarter residential revenue was above our $15 million guidance estimate, primarily due to the fast start for the sales of Homes.com. So we are going to raise our revenue forecast for Residential revenues by $15 million at the midpoint to reflect faster growth of Homes.com. Our new estimates have revenue improving almost $10 million sequentially each quarter, with revenue growing to almost $50 million by the fourth quarter of 2024. Year-over-year revenue growth is expected to be 180% in total and around 105% organic in 2024. We now expect the exit run rate for Homes.com to be in the $130 million to $140 million range, which is up from the $100 million exit run rate I provided back in February. Revenue in our commercial businesses for the first quarter came in at $638 million, which was up 12% year-over-year and above expectations. We saw a sales substitution effect, as Andy mentioned in the first quarter, as we launched Homes.com which I expect will shift our revenue mix a bit more towards Residential than what we had assumed in our full year revenue outlook we shared in February. Now my original revenue forecast model, which quite frankly, wasn't much more than an educated guess at the time, given we had not launched Homes.com, I assume that the full year sales split would be 70% commercial and around 30% residential. While the actual sales split in the first quarter was around 60% commercial and 40% residential, which translates to around a $10 million revenue shift for the full year, commercial to residential. Well, it's not really a whole lot in the grand scheme of things. It's only about 0.4% of revenue, but I thought it was at least worth noting. And you'll hear some of those effects as I talk through the rest of the product groups. Apartments.com grew revenue 21% during the first quarter, ahead of our guidance of 20% revenue growth. Crossing $1 billion in annualized revenue and celebrating 10 years from the acquisition, it's remarkable to see five straight quarters thus far on of 20% plus growth of the size and the stage of this business has become. Like whoever puts a 20% growth rate 10 years out in your acquisition model. Well, I guess Fred did because he's done a great job, and the team delivered it. What's encouraging is that Apartments.com revenue reflects only 12% penetration of the multifamily revenue opportunity, and that's just in the United States. With a strong start to the year and considering a modest sales substitution effect, we are maintaining our revenue forecast for Apartments.com of around 17% revenue growth for the full year of 2024. CoStar revenue grew 11% in the first quarter, in line with our guidance expectations. We continue to see strong growth within our hospitality, lender and owner customers, while working through this downturn and the effects of continued high interest rates on commercial real estate. In the first quarter, our CoStar sales team sold more Homes.com memberships than any of our other sales teams. Recognizing the slight shift in sales mix year, we are adjusting our revenue forecast and expected CoStar revenue growth of around 10% for the second quarter and for the full year of 2024. LoopNet revenue grew 9% in the first quarter at the high-end of our guidance range, demonstrating the ongoing productivity improvements within our dedicated net sales team. Welcome to the team, Ben. Looking forward to seeing what you can do in the quarters ahead. We expect 5% to 6% revenue growth for LoopNet in the second quarter of 2024, with full year revenue growth in the mid single digits, broadly in line and unchanged from our previous LoopNet revenue outlook. Revenue from Information Services was $33 million in the first quarter, consistent with expectations. We expect revenue for the full year to be in the range of $130 million to $135 million, in line with the revenue growth guidance range we provided in February. Other Marketplaces revenue was $31 million for the quarter, slightly ahead of guidance. Ten-X trade rates and deal closings improved in the first quarter, providing the extra revenue versus our forecast. Revenue for the second quarter is forecast to be in line with the first quarter's results. and we confirm our previous guidance for the full year 2024 revenue to be relatively flat to the full year 2023 revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $12 million in the first quarter, $27 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily attributable to our strong revenue performance and lower-than-anticipated personnel costs, with some of the favorability coming from spend -- timing of spend that we now expect to occur in the back half of the year. We remain on track with similar investment levels of Homes.com as we planned for the year and that we discussed last quarter as well as the expected adjusted EBITDA margins in our commercial product businesses unchanged from what we said at the beginning of the year. The size of our sales force is about the same at the end of the first quarter as it was at the end of 2023, 1,200 sales members. As we grow our Homes.com sales force, we expect to have a total of around 1,500 sales team members by the end of this year. Our contract renewal rate was 90% for the first quarter of 2024, while the renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for 5 years or longer remained strong at 94%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the first quarter of 2024, consistent with the prior quarter. With a strong start to the year, we are increasing our revenue guidance to a range of $2.760 billion to $2.770 billion. Net midpoint guidance is up around $5 million, with Residential revenue up $15 million and Commercial revenue -- Commercial business revenue lower by $10 million from the fine tuning of our sales mix based on the first quarter sales split. Second quarter 2024 revenue is expected to range from $674 million to $679 million, representing revenue growth rate of 11% to 12% for the quarter. Our full year revenue outlook includes revenue growth of 12% in the first half of the year, accelerating to 14% in the second half of 2024. Isn't it great to accelerate revenue growth in a really bad property market? This business is pretty amazing. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new adjusted EBITDA forecast range for the full year is now $185 million to $205 million, up $15 million at the midpoint and indicating a margin of around 7% at the midpoint of the range. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin includes the highest marketing seasonal spend for the year, and are expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million or approximately 1%. Margins are expected to increase sequentially in the second half and exit the year in the range of 15% to 16%. Our outlook for interest, capital and taxes remains unchanged for what we communicated back in February. So I'll wrap up with a few financial comments on the pending acquisition of Matterport that was announced yesterday. Financially, Matterport operates a very attractive financial model, very similar to CoStar, but at a smaller scale. Matterport has a history of strong revenue growth with a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 31%. Their subscription business represents 60% of the overall revenue and is growing over 20% per year, has a very high renewal rate similar to CoStar. We love this kind of business. The Matterport subscriber customer base is highly diverse, operating across a variety of vertical markets with no single customer over 3% of revenue. Approximately 30% of their new 3D models, along with around 30% of revenue are generated outside of the United States. This customer and vertical market diversity creates a resilient financial growth profile just like CoStar. Matterport enjoys significant operating leverage on incremental subscription revenue with gross margins of around 70%. This is scalable for high profit margins and cash generation. Matterport has a strong and conservative balance sheet with over $400 million of cash and 0 debt. Sound familiar? The total purchase price of approximately $2 billion comes with around $400 million of cash and investments which is currently on the Matterport balance sheet, yielding an enterprise value of roughly $1.6 billion. The purchase consideration will be paid 50% from our available cash balances and 50% with CoStar stock. On a net basis, after closing, we expect to use around $550 million to $600 million of our cash to complete the acquisition. Matterport expects quarterly cash flow from operations to break even in the second half of 2024 and turn positive in 2025. The breakeven point is somewhat in line with what we might see as the expected time to close the transaction. With Matterport cash flow turning positive in 2025, and modest synergy assumptions, we expect the standalone acquisition to be neutral to slightly accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share in the first year post closing. Now it's far too early to estimate financial guidance outcomes for the acquisition. We expect the post integration benefits from this acquisition to be highly value accretive for many of the reasons that Andy described. We have a strong track record of successfully acquiring, integrating and growing great companies, which I believe will continue with the combination of Matterport technology and CoStar's marketplace scale, research capabilities and project -- product development expertise. We are in a very strong financial position as we head into the second quarter, with our growth and profit plans already exceeding our expectations for the year. We are focused on and committed to accomplishing our stated long-term revenue and profit goals and we've taken a big step closer to achieving those with the fast launch of Homes.com and the potential acquisition of Matterport. I certainly believe there will be many more exciting growth years ahead for the company. Well, that's about wraps it up for me. I guess you could say for the last time on the CoStar earnings call airwaves, I'd like to say thank you, Andy, for taking me along and what I so affectionately call Mr. [indiscernible] wild ride at CoStar for the past 8 years. That's truly been, I must say, the best and without question, the most entertaining time in my professional career. Well, I will, without doubt, miss all of you, as I climb the many peaks on my list, recovering the hot tub, and experiment with the endless combinations of whiskeys available to me in crafting the ultimate Manhattans. If you stop in some time, Andy or Cyndi, I will be certainly happy to mix one up for you. Well, with that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator for a bit of Q&A.
Andrew Florance: I’m sorry, [indiscernible] Brian Radecki is on -- Brian just texted me our former CFO. Sounded a little harsh.
Unidentified Company Representative: I love Brian. [indiscernible] I know.
Andrew Florance: He's having a little martini on his plane. Okay. So the -- before we jump over to Q&A, I apologize to the operator. But that was -- this is my 103rd earnings call. Scott is a relative rookie with only 32 earnings calls with us. Certainly, very grateful everything Scott has accomplished it was 8 years with CoStar Group. And so I thought we could all do his performance review here together. These are numbers guys, so let's review his performance with its stats. At Scott's first earnings call, we had a cash balance of $422 million. We now have $5.5 [ph] billion. In the first earnings call that Scott held, we were -- our stock price was at $18 and it's now grown to $85. That's a 21% CAGR on the stock price annually through his tenure. Now we're going to have to compare that to the last CFO that you just guessed Brian Radecki. He achieved a 23% compound annual growth rate and his predecessor CFO, Frank Carchedi turned in a 25% comp annual growth rate. However, but in fairness, the rule of small numbers with Carchedi and with Radecki because our cap rate was only $75 million when they began, you began at $5 billion. So you're the hands-down winner on market cap. So our market cap when you started was $6 billion, it's now $35 billion. So you're just the victor. So well done, Scott and you go into the CoStar CFO hall of fame. And now you've successfully summited CoStar mountain. God speed climbing all the other mountains around the world, your heart desires to climb, and I will take you up on the Manhattan. I'm not a big Manhattan guy, but I would look forward to a quality mix. So with that sort of unprofessional [indiscernible] we'll turn it over to Q&A with our operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. You may proceed.
Q - Peter Christiansen: Thank you. Good evening. Really nice trends, great execution here. Congrats, Scott. You got a fun ride.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Pete.
Peter Christiansen: Andy, I was just wondering if you could just put a little bit more color on the Homes.com production this last quarter, win-loss rates, inbound versus outbound, decision cycle? Any of that color, I think, would be helpful. Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So obviously, exceeded expectations. I would say that it is mostly outbound. There was strong inbound interest. There was a lot of convention sales. So there are a number of industry events out there, and people were buying a lot at various brokerage firm specific events. The close cycle is extremely fast. It typically is demo closed simultaneously. There isn't a win loss really because no one is providing a similar service in the United States. Our offering is unique. They're anecdotally, there -- we have heard some substitution effect with some of the lead diversion model legacy providers. But by and large, it is a short sales cycle pretty straightforward. We are selling the individual agents. They're typically paying with a credit card, but at the end of the demo. And again, the fact that 90% are going for an annual agreement is pretty positive. It would appear that priority for us going forward is just scaling the Homes.com sales team because while it's great to have overall sales force doing it, you eventually want to get everyone back to their core products and build big enough sales team to manage the 500,000 to 600,000 prospects we've got for this product.
Peter Christiansen: Thank you. Congrats again.
Andrew Florance: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. You may proceed. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon and I also want to extend, Scott, my congrats to you on your retirement. Well deserved.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, George. Thank you.
George Tong: So wanted to follow-up on the Homes.com progress with the sales. You mentioned selling 8,000 memberships in the first quarter, average price of $475 to $500 per month. I guess, do you see the average price changing as the growth trajectory matures? Or is it pretty much steady state and primarily going to be driven by volumes? And how have those volumes performed exiting the quarter? So how did the run rates look like exiting 1Q? And how do you overall think about the addressable market, like the total number of memberships that are available out there that you can tackle.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So that's correct. We are around 8,000 members and 475 to 500. I do not think that price really changes through time. There's no cherry picking bigger accounts or smaller potential accounts. It's been pretty much even movement across the board. So I'd anticipate that same price point, we are very happy with that price point. It's both priced way below what other competitors are charging for their relative services. And yet it's a pretty solid price point per person for CoStar Group overall. There was a surge of buying activity with a couple of big conferences early in -- or mid-February, and a little bit of some sales people moving back to selling Apartments.com and LoopNet and some return. But we are simultaneously accelerating the growth of the Homes team pretty aggressively. So the numbers remain solid as we leave the quarter. When you look at the overall potential, there is, I mean, I would love to get that number up to 100,000 members sooner rather than later. But you absolutely have the potential to reach hundreds of thousands of members. And by comparison, if you say, look at another real estate marketplace, we've got like LoopNet, you see, like, say, in Florida, California, you see 60%, 70%, 80% of properties marketed on that platform. So under our model, unlike some of the other models, we can achieve super high penetration rates. And so we want to balanced price and volume so that the broader market gets to participate and you create goodwill across a bigger section of residential real estate. But number has been great.
George Tong: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Alexei Gogolev: Hi, everyone. I had a question about EBITDA margin of your non-Residential business. Scott, could you elaborate a bit more what was the level of EBITDA margin in the first quarter and whether or not you're still on track to reach the full year target of roughly 42%?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Alexei, we are definitely still on target with what we expected for the year, for the 42% margin. And in the first quarter, hold on a minute, let me find that for you. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margins were about 39% to start the year.
Alexei Gogolev: Understood. And considering that you are also looking for positive EBITDA for Homes.com business or rather for the overall business for the second quarter, does that imply that you may have already peaked resi spend in the first quarter and that it will be roughly similar, but not higher in 2Q?
Scott Wheeler: When you look at the Residential forecast, we typically see in the second quarter, higher marketing expenses. In this case, it will be slightly lower in the second quarter because we had the fast launch in Q1. So quarter expenses will be roughly the same in the second quarter as the first, and then it will decline throughout the year in our Residential outlook. And our total expected spending in Residential remains unchanged to what we communicated back in February. I hope that helps.
Alexei Gogolev: It does, Scott. Thank you very much and I appreciate all the help over the years.
Scott Wheeler: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW. You may proceed.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Andy, just to elaborate on the pricing at Homes.com, when you say you're satisfied with where pricing is, is that just based on the basic tier currently. And what are your plans for adding additional premium tiers as time passes, that could potentially increase the average rate over time? Thanks.
Andrew Florance: So I really am happy with the pricing model we went to market with. We blended -- we obviously have to have an element that is price per listing because each listing takes up valuable real estate as it sorts higher in the order. You also have to acknowledge that someone might be selling properties in a market that the average home sale is 125 and some might be selling properties where the average home sale is $3 million. So our pricing scheme is somewhat bespoke to the particular agent. And the reaction to the pricing that we are putting out there is super positive. And I mean they had not a lot of pushback on it. So there was one person that the formula priced them out at $500,000 a month, and we didn't get the reaction we were looking for with them. But everyone else is doing pretty good. We are super early stages here with just 8,000 members where I anticipate we'll have hundreds of thousands of members. We are super early stage. It's super important, in my view, for a marketplace to go for mass adoption participation of agents is our highest priority. And it's -- we won't look at doing premium tiers for a period of time until our penetration rates are in the teens and 20%. We just want to focus on what is really important, which is getting that first level of membership in there. I can tell you anecdotally from our sales force, there's demand for premium tiers. Our clients, particularly in residential real estate, would appear to be highly competitive with one another. And agents who -- listings are now up on Page 1, instead of Page 30 are now complaining that they would like to buy #1 on the page. I don't want to be #5 on the page. So there's clearly demand for premium. But in other countries or where people have -- you're listing your lead model like we do, often it's the home seller who's paying for the premium going up to the gold diamond platinum levels. But I think there is certainly demand for gold level at the agent level.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for that color and congratulations, Scott, on the retirement. Enjoy those Manhattans.
Scott Wheeler: Thanks, Ryan. Like I said, stop by, and I'll whip you one up.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for question. Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. You may proceed.
Stephen Sheldon: Hey, thanks and I'll echo my congrats, Scott. Given the traction that you've seen with Homes.com, curious what you're wanting to see before you shift incentives back in your existing sales force to focus exclusively on their own core businesses, so suite with Apartments.com, et cetera. And do you have a rough time line, I guess, in mind for when that might happen?
Andrew Florance: We are really happy with the traction we've got. We want to keep that going. I would -- I want to be able to report good solid numbers for '24 on the Homes.com launch. I want to give time to Andy Stearns to build up the 300, 400 person sales force. And then the other factor, honestly, is the Apartments.com, LoopNet, CoStar sales people want to have an opportunity to sell Homes.com. So we're sort of responding to the sales force wanting to participate in an exciting event. There are some number of people who are good at selling their core product and maybe they haven't been successful the Homes, those folks have already returned to focusing on their core product, maybe 200 some people. think we will be using the broader effort through the end of the year and then in '25, we'll begin to focus more on a dedicated sales team. The good news is that the centralized team in Richmond is successfully selling at effectively the exact same pace of anyone out in the market next door to a real estate agent. So happy with that. It's a question of scaling the dedicated Homes team.
Stephen Sheldon: Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Just switching topics here to Apartments.com, can you maybe talk about the outlook for unit deliveries this year? It looks like that might peak. And then potentially what that means on a go-forward basis as we look into towards the end of the year and into 2025 for growth rates?
Andrew Florance: So yes -- so the unit deliveries are coming down slightly. They're still very high by historical standards. And we're up, what, 9.1% [indiscernible] where that is and we're 9.1% that is very high for the apartment industry, and we are up at the point at which you're a little uncomfortable with refinancings and liquidity for some of the owners of apartment buildings. It'd actually be nice to see a little more stability in the market and have that vacancy rate come down next year. But I think we have 2 to 3 years at least of elevated vacancy, which is sort of the Goldilocks environment for selling Apartments.com. So again, each of our products is going to go through different environmental cycles. So we will have to worry about that perhaps in 2, 3 years, maybe we won't have to worry about it in 2 or 3 years.
Surinder Thind: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens. You may proceed.
John Campbell: Hi, guys and Scott, I'll keep it going here. Congrats to you and best wishes on the next journey.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, John.
John Campbell: For sure. Staying on Homes.com, Andy, I think last quarter, you talked to only demoing the product, to 2% of all U.S. agents. I guess just with your hiring plans and the rate you've run this far, just how long do you feel it will take to kind of reach your target market?
Andrew Florance: Yes. I wish I had the precise number there for you. So when we spoke last time, it was -- we demoed 2%. I'm actually really pleased with the conversion rate. So when we get a demo to a close, that's high -- that’s a solid double-digit number, I think in the 20s to 30s from where we -- when we get a demo to the close rate. So the bigger challenge is having enough people and getting enough demos. But that's great. We'll eventually get demos with everyone eventually. So you just keep on bringing different marketing messages out there to folks. You keep trying to reconnect for people in various environments and context, and we'll get there. So we are still at the -- as we pass through the 40 million mark, we have demoed 7%.
Scott Wheeler: Of the prospects, the 500,000 some prospects up to this point, we've demoed about 7%.
Andrew Florance: So there's 540,000 core prospects we've defined and we've demoed 7%. Now we have sold a lot of product to folks who have no listings. So the 540,000 is probably the wrong denominator. The denominator could be 1 million plus given the fact that so many people with no listings have subscribed.
John Campbell: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one quick follow-up related to that, [indiscernible]. Those who are subscribing without listings, what do you typically see as the key draw for them?
Andrew Florance: Well, you have -- you always have a large number of folks who are trying to break in the residential real estate who have not to date been as successful as they'd like. Over 97% of agents are really do both buyer agency and seller agency. There are some instances where established agent at the moment doesn't have a listing, but they've got listings last year. But if you have done some transactions at the last 3 years, and you can get your name up on neighborhoods as being an expert, if you can sort to the top of a major directory for an area. If you can retarget people come to the site and looking for properties that are relevant to your experience level, even if you have no listing, we do give you hundreds of thousands of exposures and both on the site and off the site with retargeting. So there is value there. I do think that realistically with the changes with the lawsuits and any future changes coming down the road with an adjusted apartment activity, that residential real estate will be a little bit more of a sport of people with listings will get more listings, but happy to help people without new listings or people with lot of listings.
John Campbell: Thanks, Andy.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for letting me back in. I guess I got scared away by the baby crying.
Andrew Florance: Heather, if you're confused, I think many people in the listening audience today are confused. There was a -- our last CFO, who is an outstanding CFO, and he's listening right now. I got a little [indiscernible] at the emotional overload of leaving CoStar and we haven't let them live it down. In another 10 years, we'll stop talking about it.
Heather Balsky: Appreciate it. I appreciate you have to play it again. So on Matterport, I'm just curious a little bit to hear how you're thinking about that business being part of CoStar going forward? There's been some headlines around Homes.com, but curious about the broader business strategy and its existing sort of standalone business. Like how are you going to integrate it? How do you plan to use it more? And do you think you can do something to kind of jump start the existing sort of revenue growth strategy?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So in terms of -- let's start with the existing growth strategy. I am highly confident by -- through pulling levers on pricing, on switching between upfront purchase equipment, subscription models, relying more heavily on capture networks. I feel -- and then also by the virtue of the fact that we aggressively adopt the digital twins more broadly. That all those things together will allow us to significantly accelerate the sales or revenue of Matterport outside of it being used inside of anything in CoStar. In other words, outside of being used as part of Homes.com Apartments.com, LoopNet, so on and so forth. But -- and I think Matterport penetration will have some slight different numbers on that. I'm confident sub 5% in the United States. I'm confident sub 1% in Europe. And at that -- at those levels, I am a big believer in the value of a Matterport when you're trying to sell a $500,000 or $1 million property. And then I think those adoption rates will ultimately go up 50% or more for digital twins with people moving real estate. There was a time when only 5% of the real estate listings had a photo. So the digital twins is going to be -- I think. And there are a number of different players out there, and our goal will be to try to capture a leading share of the digital twin. So there are different solutions at different quality levels. When you look at how we integrate it into our product, we are going to -- first of all, we believe that just -- the overall goal of what we're doing is helping people lease and sell their real estate or to analyze real estate. These three dimensional, these 3D, three spatial twins are transformative, really important tools, and we are going to make them ubiquitous across our sites. So we've been an aggressive adopter to date, we're going grow it dramatically. And virtually everything we are doing. So even think about something like our CoStar Real Estate Manager, a significant percentage of the Fortune 500 use CoStar Real Estate Manager to manage their leases, critical dates, their facility strategies, giving their real estate people the ability to look at a 3D representation, a walk through one of their facilities is super valuable. Even if it's something is as small as a -- the equipment room on a cellular antenna, being able to go into that Matterport and seeing what the RAC configuration is and see how much room there is, is there room for more RACs, that kind of stuff. The stuff is ubiquitous and super valuable. So being aggressively adopting it, we think will fuel growth and differentiate us from other folks. But the other thing is I think there's an enormous amount of data here. So if you think of the failure of AVMs, automated valuation models, to deliver real value, my belief is that one of the big failures of AVMs to date has been the fact that they are taking tabular data, a handful of tabular data fields around one point on a map is really fails to capture the real characteristic of the real estate asset. When you have a Matterport, you're able to recognize infinitely more information about the space you're in, you can determine quality, you can determine build out, you determine just things like sensing the fact that there's really [indiscernible].There's a -- the nature of the layout, looking at the views out the windows, are you looking at another building 5 feet away or do you have a view of the Hudson River, which one is it? So I think this will also -- there's an enormous data advantage here that you can use to inform automated valuation models and understand market statistics better. And that's certainly true with certainly residential, but also commercial real estate. So if I'm trying to understand where lease rates are, and I can ascertain that this space was raw, which machine vision can do. Artificial intelligence can determine whether it was unfinished space versus polished space, that's going to impact how you calculate the economics of what the lease deal was. And then with -- right now, Matterport is really beautiful at being able to move through a space in a semi-natural format. But with the work that Apple, the commitment that Apple has and Meta has to building headsets, I believe that you will, in the next 3 years or so have smooth walk-through capabilities through these digital twins, which will be super powerful. The ability to also take the twin outside of the structure and actually capture the exterior of the structure and possibly moving the capture equipment to a drone as well. So in my spare time, I have been putting expensive Matterport's on top of expensive drones and trying to capture it externally. But it's hard to do that with a weekend research projects, really need professionals to do that.
Scott Wheeler: Leading to extensive write-offs and expensive drones.
Andrew Florance: No, no big crashes yet. No big crashes. But the odd looks from the neighbors. But the -- so I think the technology is going to be -- is going to go through a real exponential acceleration. I think the data is super valuable. I think it's table stakes going forward for marketing space. I think it moves the AVMs. And I think as the rest of the world figures out that it's really silly. To me, today, to mark an office building or a warehouse building or a hotel event space or a home without a digital twin is thoughtless. It's sort of inadequate. Do I sound passionate about that?
Heather Balsky: Yes. I appreciate the answer. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Andy for any closing remarks.
Andrew Florance: Well, I'd like to thank you all for joining us again for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm glad we were able to report good results, initial results on the Homes.com monetization. And again, thank you, Scott, for all the outstanding work you've done. And Brian, I apologize for Scott, poking the bear on the last CFO. Bye, everyone.
A - Scott Wheeler: Goodbye, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-03-04 17:00:00) =====

Andrew Florance: Fantastic job, Cindy. Thank you. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for CoStar Groups fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings call Total revenue for the full year of 2023 was $2.46 billion, a 13% increase over the full year of 2022 Coming in above the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $640 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This is our 13th year in a row of double-digit revenue growth. We turned in another very strong year in sales in 2023 achieving our second highest net new bookings level ever of $286 million, this performance in the face of higher interest rates and demand shocks that kept property markets distressed in 2023 demonstrates the resilience of our business. Our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $492 million and $130 million for the fourth quarter ahead of both the high end of our guidance range and consensus estimates. I'm proud to say that we achieved a major profit milestone in 2023 in our commercial real estate information and marketplace businesses as we deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of 40% for the full year. For the past three years thousands of our team members have worked with professionalism and committed focus to build the new homes.com the premier marketplace for buying, selling and renting homes in the United States. We've conducted dozens of focus groups across the country listening to hundreds of agents, homebuyers and home sellers learning why they were so dissatisfied with the legacy offerings and what they hope for in a better residential portal. We heard loud and clear that brokers, agents, sellers, buyers, and investors all dislike real estate portals that use agent’s listings as bait to draw in homebuyers and then sell them off to other agents as leads with exorbitant commission splits. We learned that homebuyers buy a home in a community not in isolation. So they want quality in-depth information on neighborhood schools, parks, restaurants, and local culture. Our product teams have designed what we believe is clearly the best residential real estate site in the world. The site is clean, powerful, intuitive, appealing, and spam free. Our software developers rose to the challenge and built a lightning-fast reliable platform that met the design specifications perfectly. Good job, Jerry and Zach and crew. Our content team comprised of hundreds of photographers, drone pilots, writers, voiceover talent, musicians, geographers, and video editors captured the essence of tens of thousands of U.S. neighborhoods, schools, and parks. Our dream team drew 2.6 million miles, captured 1.5 million images, shot 3.8 million video clips, and conducted over 350,000 drone flights. This investment creates an experience that consumers love, strengthens our SEO traffic position, and provides a significant advantage over competitive sites. Our efforts to grow traffic on homes.com in 2023 were a big success. Homes.com was the fastest growing real estate website at the end of 2023 with over 600% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter according to Google Analytics. Our residential network traffic in the fourth quarter totaled 95 million average monthly unique visitors growing 94% year-over-year. We were easily in second place in traffic by this measure, well ahead of the 66 million average monthly unique visitors at realtor.com reported two weeks ago. Our largest competitors Realtor and Zillow reported either flat or declining traffic in the fourth quarter of 2023. I believe we will be able to report even stronger traffic numbers in the near future. After building the site and traffic for over two years, last week we launched a massive marketing campaign for homes.com with four commercials during the Super Bowl, an event that was watched by an estimated 123 million viewers. We ran a clever apartments.com commercial in the first quarter with Invading Aliens to set Jeff Goldblum up for a memorable cameo in the first homes.com ad in the second quarter connecting the two brands. In the spots Dan Levy plays the nephew inheriting his uncle's business homes.com and he sets out to reinvent the company and make it better than ever. He is supported by his hesitant sidekick played by SNL's Heidi Garner. The spots draw attention to the value of our neighborhood and school data that we offer home shoppers. The Super Bowl was only the kick-off. In the week following the Super Bowl we generated an estimated 560 million impressions across prime broadcast TV, syndicated TV, cable TV, morning shows, late-night shows, major streaming audio and video platforms, and of course on Google in various forms. During the course of the year we will be in the Olympics, the Oscars, the Emmys, March Madness, the U.S. Open, the Stanley Cup playoffs, Major League Baseball and much more. We believe that we will generate approximately $80 billion each in 90% of U.S. households with our message in 2024. We believe that no other competitor is investing close to what we're investing in this effort. We believe we can grow share. We believe that we have a better product and can significantly shift share and create a very attractive ROI for our investors. While we have excellent traffic numbers, we do not yet have the unaided awareness we need to sustain the top traffic position and to draw the volume of advertisers we seek. As we did with apartments.com, our plan is to grow unaided awareness from the low single digits to more than 50%. That process will take time, but we believe that it will drive brand awareness, SEO, SEM efficiency, traffic, audience, customer demand, and revenue. On Monday, February 12th, the day after the Super Bowl, we were ready to begin monetizing homes.com, selling memberships to agents a quarter earlier than we had previously communicated to you. As we did when we launched the new LoopNet, the new apartments and the new apartments.com, we deployed the entire CoStar Group sales force to sell homes.com. Our goal is to catapult our growth forward and quickly capitalize on the momentum and exposure generated from our marketing campaign. Our 1,000 plus person sales force gives us instant national reach with experienced sales people that live in many of the very same neighborhoods as the 1.5 million residential property agents that we intend to reach. We trained the full sales team in January and rolled out very attractive incentive structures that reward our sellers to sell both homes and their primary brands like CoStar or apartments along with homes. The more they sell of both brands combined, the more money they make. In addition to leveraging the strength of our entire CoStar Group sales team, we are rapidly building a sales force dedicated to selling only homes.com. We've recruited a vice president, sales managers, and 100 sellers to date and intend to have over 300 account sales representatives in place by the end of the year. The response to our sales effort is phenomenal. From a standing start, we sold almost 5.2 million. It was 5 million half an hour ago. 5.2 million annualized subscription revenue in just a little over a week. From a modest start on Monday, our sales climbed each day and by Friday, we were selling $1.1 million in memberships in a single day. We've sold more than 827 memberships so far with approximately 90% of the agents selecting 12-month memberships with the rest choosing a six-month subscription. We've seen agents with larger portfolios signing up at price points in the thousands of dollars a month, so far topping out at $7,400 a month. We have proposals out at much higher price points. We also have agents with just a listing or so signing up at price points of only $100 to $200 a month. It doesn't matter if you're an agent with a large portfolio or small portfolio. Either way, we're charging a small fraction of the serious ridiculously high 30% to 40% of commissions being charged by Zillow and Realtor.com to agents. We have only demoed 0.02% of the agents out there at this point. If we maintain this pace, we could sell around $200 million in annual reoccurring revenue in our first 12 months of selling. The great news is that agents are definitely willing to spend for advertising exposure and they absolutely love the Homes.com 'your listing, your lead' business model. Our direct field sales team, telephone sales teams, and e-commerce sales channels are all producing results. We are initially focused on approximately 500,000 of the 1.5 million agents in the country. The annual revenue potential of this initial pool of agents for a basic homes.com membership is over $2.5 billion. Knowing that apartments.com basic silver ads comprise around 25% of all apartments.com listings, if this same ratio were to apply to homes.com, then the potential opportunity could be as high as $10 billion. Overall, I'm very proud of what the team has worked so hard to accomplish with homes.com in only three years and believe it will be the most successful product launch in CoStar Group history. This coming year also marks a turning point as we've reached the peak year of our residential investment. With sales and revenue growing in the months ahead, we expect overall company profit levels to increase each quarter throughout the year and for the foreseeable future. In December, we successfully closed our acquisition of OnTheMarket in the United Kingdom for £100 million. We believe that at the time of the acquisition of OnTheMarket, we believe that the time of the acquisition of OnTheMarket was one of the top three residential portals in the U.K. £100 million is 2% of the current leading portal, Rightmove's £4.4 billion market cap. Rightmove currently has significantly more traffic than OnTheMarket, so a top priority for us is to grow the appeal of the site for homebuyers and sellers and grow traffic. Just one month in, we're making huge progress, increasing January 2024 site traffic to OnTheMarket by 81% year-over-year, according to Google Analytics. We didn't waste time. We believe that we are now the fastest growing residential portal in the U.K. As our traffic has grown, our leads have also grown 81% since December of 2023. Rightmove announced at their recent investor day that they plan to grow revenue per agent by 42% to over £2,000 per agent per month over the next five years. That is 10 times what OnTheMarket charges agents today. Rightmove is also committed to maintaining at least 70% profit margin levels through 2028, leaving them little room for investing in product and technology. You simply cannot make this stuff up, but you have to love it. In sharp contrast, we plan to continue CoStar's longstanding strategy of investing and partnering with agents in the industry to generate and attract high intent leads at a fraction of the cost of other U.K. portals while still achieving an attractive margin. Agents are telling us that they're in search of an alternative to Rightmove's unfriendly agent listing fees and are supportive of OnTheMarket. Since acquisition, we have added over 1,000 agent advertisers and 57,000 listings to the site, again, in a matter of two months. Our long-term intention is to create the number one property portal in the U.K. by combining CoStar's marketing and traffic generation expertise, the market-leading technology we've developed in homes.com, CoStar's research and content generation capabilities, and the strength of our established commercial real estate platform in the U.K. The European residential market opportunity is estimated to be $17 billion, and we intend to build and expand our share of the residential opportunity in Europe, beginning with OnTheMarket. Apartments.com had a phenomenal year. Revenue for the year was $914 million, or 23% growth over 2022. This is almost $170 million of incremental annual revenue, the largest contribution ever for any of our brands. As of January this year, Apartments.com is now not only the largest business by revenue at CoStar, but also officially our first billion-dollar revenue run rate business. But here comes CoStar right behind it, and then homes. The sales team delivered exceptional results at Apartments.com in 2023, with annualized net new bookings growing 34% over 2022. We now have almost 71,000 communities advertising their availabilities on Apartments.com, which is 11% above the fourth quarter of 2022, and almost twice that of our nearest competitor. Our highly productive sales team conducted over 623,000 quality meetings in 2023, which was 37% higher than in 2022, and a new record. Our customers love our sales team, rewarding them with a 94% net promoter score rating for the full year of 2023. We continue to expand our mid-market sales effort by growing our sales team and developing targeted product offerings that suit the needs of mid-sized communities. Net productivity for our sales team increased by 14% in 2023, as compared to 2022, which resulted in a 44% growth in properties under 50 units advertising on Apartments.com. The opportunity in the small property sector is massive at almost $7 billion, and our penetration in this sector is still below 5%. Our award-winning marketing campaign, featuring the wonderful and very funny Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, inventor of the Apartminternet, entertained audiences and delivered over 12 billion media impressions and almost 1 billion visits to our websites during the year. We jump-started our 2024 media campaign with a Super Bowl ad. This is year 10 of our brand-building marketing campaign since we launched Apartments.com back in 2015. This consistent, long-term brand marketing strategy continues to prove successful as we finish the year with 52% unaided brand awareness, with renters in the fourth quarter 6 percentage points above our closest competitor. Based on a recent study by market research firm Market Connections, industry decision makers representing 15,000 communities named Apartments.com as the most widely used advertising solution at 74%. The research also found that Apartments.com was the most well-known advertising solution, beating our closest competitor by 25%. The Apartments.com brand is stronger than it's ever been, delivering almost a billion visits to our websites and 43 million average monthly unique visitors during 2023, according to Google Analytics. Our customers care about the number of potential renters utilizing our site every month to find a place to live, making unique visitors a key metric. For the past eight quarters in a row, Apartments.com held the number one position in terms of monthly average unique visitors when comparing our traffic to Zillow's publicly disclosed average monthly unique visitors. Overall economic conditions are expected to remain favorable for rental property advertising. Vacancy rates increased in 2023 for three to five-star properties by 160 basis points to 9.1%, and are expected to increase in 2024 as new unit deliveries are expected to remain high in 2024 at approximately 470,000 units. We expect to see Apartments.com generate strong double-digit revenue growth in 2024, somewhere in the high teens or more, which is balanced to some degree by the level of Homes.com sales effort that's top-performing advertising Juggernaut delivers in 2024. CoStar delivered another strong quarter with revenues of $925 million and 11% year-over-year growth rate. Fourth quarter, revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $238 million. We have never seen this level of positive revenue growth for CoStar while we're at the bottom of a severe property market downturn. The strength of CoStar continues to be our ability to expand the information, content, and analytic capabilities in the product to diversify into bigger and broader customer sets, like owners, lenders, and corporate tenants. In 2023, we sold twice as much to the owner, lender, and corporate tenant sectors than we did to brokers. Net sales in the fourth quarter to owner, lender, and tenant customers grew almost 30% compared to the third quarter of this year. The CoStar lender product had an exceptional year in 2023, nearly doubling our customer base and delivering over five times the revenue that we realized in 2022. We now have over 1,000 active users for our lender product. Our opportunity pipeline is large, with over 300 institutions progressing through our sales process. Our competitive data advantage has helped us win virtually every deal versus the main competitors in this space, including winning seven of the largest CRE lenders in the industry. Looking ahead, there is significant opportunity to expand the CoStar lender addressable market beyond our initial focus on depository institutions. As regional banks and credit unions tighten up their credit lending requirements, their commercial lending requirements, private lenders are stepping in to fill the void. We believe the total addressable market for our expanded target customer set is over 600 million. We are currently serving less than 15% of this opportunity and have plans to increase our sales and product teams to accelerate our growth next year. We released our hospitality benchmarking product in the CoStar platform in 2023 and are rapidly migrating our SDR customer base into the CoStar environment. Over 600 customers are now using the benchmark product in CoStar, with the remaining customers to be migrated in the first half of 2024. More than 18,000 users are now in CoStar managing their hotel's performance and optimizing their revenue through the reimagined tools and additional analytic capabilities. As a result of the movement of SDR benchmarking at CoStar, revenues from our hospitality benchmark subscriptions will now be reported as part of CoStar, similar to our integrated approach of our lender products for financial institutions being CoStar. The transition of SDR benchmarking to CoStar in 2024 is a major milestone for our roadmap to build the full suite of SDR product capabilities in CoStar. We plan to incorporate forward booking information, complete P&L benchmarking, and international market performance this year and the next. SDR overall had an incredible year. 2023 revenue grew 13% over last year, delivering the highest annual ever result since we bought SDR in 2019. The team had a record sales quarter to end the year, growing 54% over the fourth quarter of last year. Subscription revenue grew 17% in 2023 over the prior year and now makes up 81% of the overall revenue, the highest percentage since the acquisition. SDR's quarterly renewal rate is now in a very impressive 98%. With the full capability of CoStar and SDR combined, we expect to unlock increased value for our customers and grow strong double-digit revenue towards what we believe is a 300 million hospitality market opportunity. Overall, we remain very confident in the strength and value of CoStar's platform and our growth performance in the downturn. Renewal rates for CoStar remain rock solid at 92% and we're seeing early indications of increased leasing and sales activity as we move into the first quarter of 2024. Although it's too early to call a recovery in the property markets, we expect solid mid-single digit revenue growth from CoStar in 2024. LoopNet revenue was $265 million in 2023, up 15% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. Signature listings, signature ad listings were up 11% in the fourth quarter, delivering more traffic and leads to our customers. International revenue in the fourth quarter was up 33% and net new bookings were up 186% over the fourth quarter of 2022. LoopNet continues to be the number one listing site for commercial properties. Average monthly unique visitors to the global network in the fourth quarter were up 11% year-over-year and was seven times the traffic of the next largest competitor. In the U.K., LoopNet is now the number one dedicated commercial property marketplace by traffic after launching only a little over a year ago. We continue to expand internationally given our success to date and the size of the opportunity. We plan to launch LoopNet in France and Spain in 2024. In -- 2023 was a year of growth for LoopNet sales team. At the end of 2022, only 40% of the sales were managed by LoopNet dedicated sales representatives and we've now effectively transitioned to 80% of those accounts from CoStar reps to LoopNet reps. The LoopNet sales team is focused on ramping up activity, face-to-face meetings and MPS scores following the success formula of apartments.com. As a result, we expect to deliver increased sales productivity and bookings as we move through 2024. Ten-X continues to demonstrate the value of our digital sales platform for our commercial properties. In a year when sales transactions were down 49%, Ten-X brought $4.5 billion in assets to the platform, which was a modest decline of 9% relative to the market's steeper decline. We delivered a 52% trade rate in 2023, nearly double the offline trade rate, but below the rates we achieved in 2022. Overall, Ten-X revenue finished the year around 20% below prior year levels. Despite this decline, we increased our share of property sales in the $1million to $10 million asset category during the year, moving more transactions from offline to online. The market outlook for the coming year remains uncertain, although interest rates have stabilized near-term, bid-ask spreads and debt constraints remain a challenge. Regardless of these uncertainties, in the first 45 days of 2024, our trade rate and number of bidders per asset have increased from the fourth quarter of 2023 levels. There are still billions of dollars of transactions occurring each year in the $1 billion to $10 billion asset category, which we continue to pursue as part of what we believe is a $3 billion long-term market opportunity. The real estate capital markets in the fourth quarter continue to be impacted by higher borrowing costs, tight lending standards, and deteriorating real estate fundamentals. In 2023, transaction volumes were down 49% and price declines ranged from 10% to 35% across all sectors. Banks continue to slow their loan growth as property fundamentals decline and delinquencies rise. With interest rates expected to decline later this year, current expectations are for sales volumes to increase compared to last year. We saw some early indications in January with sales volumes rising 6.4%. The office sector continues to be the most challenged with 58 million square feet of negative absorption in 2023. Absorption since the pandemic now sits at negative 178 million square feet. Office attendance is 60% of what it was before 2020, though that understates demand since hybrid work requires higher peak use. The market sits at a record high 13.5% vacancy rate. A silver lining is the decline in construction starts, which we predict will eventually result in a shortage of premium office space. Since our 15-year lease at our Washington DC headquarters location is set to expire in 2025, we assess more than 25 viable sites in the greater Washington DC metro area. We ultimately decided to purchase a five-star trophy LEED Platinum office building located at 1201 Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia. We were able to purchase the building and the land lease for a significant discount to both recent valuations and current replacement costs. We also received nearly $7 million in both tax and economic incentives. While past performance does not ensure future performance, you might recall that back in 2010 during the great financial crisis, we acquired our 1331 L Street location for $42 million, a then significant discount to replacement costs, and sold it within two years and the sale lease back for $101 million, more than twice what we bought it for. We are betting that the office market is at a Nadar [ph] again. We will likely execute a sales lease back on 1201 Wilson Boulevard at some point in the future. The industrial sector has also seen a historic wave of new construction push vacancies up from all-time lows, but at 5.7%, industrial vacancies are still at half their peak levels. Industrial demand has remained positive, though, and the rise in vacancies should be mitigated by a pullback in construction starts in the second half of 2023. The retail sector continued to be the best performing in the fourth quarter with both positive absorption and limited new construction. The result was vacancy rates dropping to 4%, an all-time low. Conditions should remain healthy for retail with under construction at near all-time level lows. The U.S. hotel sector ended the year with RevPAR growth of 4.9%, outpacing inflation and being driven by ADR growth of 4.3% and occupancy growth of 0.6%. Robust group demand and corporate transient demand were the primary contributors to growth. RevPAR is expected to continue to outpace inflation in 2024 with 4.1% growth projected. In the U.S. residential sector, mortgage rates have come down from 7.8% to 6.6%, but rates are still high enough to prevent homeowners from selling, creating low inventory of homes for sale, and low levels of homes being sold. But if interest rates continue to drop, affordability will improve, and even a drop to 6% would mean home ownership would become affordable for an additional 37 million Americans. In the context of a distressed commercial real estate market, CoStar turned in an outstanding performance in 2023, growing revenue 13% with record levels of profitability in our CRE business. It is clear that CoStar Group's diversified subscription business is highly resilient in a distressed property cycle. We believe that we will improve profits and margins again in 2024 to $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA with 42% margins. Our entire team has worked extraordinarily hard in building the Homes.com platform and business. We believe that we just launched CoStar Group's next transformative billion-dollar business. In the conversations we are having with brokerage leaders, and agents, they tell us they are 100% behind our year-list and year-lead business model, but it gets better for brokers, agents, homebuyers, and home sellers. I am thrilled to see that support with $5.2 million in annualized subscription sales in just the first six business days of selling Homes.com. The first half of 2024 is the peak investment for Homes.com, and we believe profits and margins will start showing significant growth in the second half of 2024. After my brief remarks, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler. Are you still there, Scott?
Scott Wheeler: Still here. Ready to go. Thank you for those brief remarks. Okay. So clearly 2023 was a very strong year for the company, but that sure feels like a long time ago, doesn't it? These last few weeks have really been like turning a page when you get into the launch of Homes.com, the advertising brand campaign, the selling efforts. I think 2024 is going to be a great year. I can already tell. But first, let's wrap up on 2023. The full-year revenue growth was an impressive 13% versus prior year, which was ahead of our guidance and forecast. What I found interesting was that 2023 was the 13th consecutive year of double-digit growth, and we grew 13%. Did you know that? And last year, when our 12th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, we grew 12%. I wonder what that means this year. We'll see. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, but we actually turned in a great revenue performance in 2023. Profit results also came in above expectations, with full-year adjusted EBITDA at $492 million and 20% margin, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. What I think most is impressive is that you can still see our core CoStar business delivering 40% profit margins and a record high, 45% in the fourth quarter, before you consider the investments we're making moving into the residential sector. I think it's important we keep an eye on the underlying strength of this business portfolio as we exit the investment phase of Homes.com particularly, and we'll expect profitability to increase, as Andy mentioned, once again as we move through 2024. So looking at our revenue by our different businesses, Apartments.com grew 23% in the fourth quarter and the full year, in line with our expectations. Apartments.com added twice the amount of revenue in 2023 than its nearest competitor, and increased revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 sequentially over the third quarter, which demonstrates both the strength of our product platform and our 97% subscription model in Apartments.com. Now, our competitors are still in the game of chasing transaction revenue, which is why their revenue cycle is up in the middle of the year and then drops back in the fourth quarter. These transactions sure feel good during an upswing in market demand, but will leave you weak and unable to invest in a cyclical downturn. We expect Apartments.com revenue growth rates somewhere in the 17% to 18% range for the full year of 2024, and we're estimating 20% revenue growth for the first quarter. We expect our renewal pricing levels to moderate this coming year as inflation in the economy has come down. Also, we continue to grow aggressively in the smaller property space, which carries lower price points relative to institutional scale communities. We're going to see increased levels of productivity in 2024 for our large and more experienced salesforce and apartments. Now, the question is, will this increased output benefit Apartments or Homes.com? So far, this sales team is proving very effective at selling both. CoStar revenue grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year of 2023 at the top end of our full year guidance range. As Andy mentioned, in 2024, we will report STR benchmarking revenue in CoStar, as the STR product is now fully integrated in the CoStar platform and customer migrations will be complete this year. Including our benchmarking revenue, we expect full year and first quarter CoStar revenue growth in the range of 11% to 12%. So in 2024, CoStar will become our second brand business, producing over $1 billion in revenue. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the STR revenue shift, we expect CoStar revenue growth of between 7% to 8% consistent with what we indicated in our third quarter earnings call back in October. LoopNet revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter, exceeding our 11% guidance. Revenue for the full year was $265 million, or a 15% increase over prior year, at the top end of our guidance range of 14% to 15%. We expect to see first quarter LoopNet revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9%, as the sales results for LoopNet in the fourth quarter were lower than earlier in the year, following the full account transitions from CoStar to LoopNet. We expect our LoopNet sales team to make meaningful contributions to selling both LoopNet and Homes.com in 2024. So accordingly, our LoopNet 2024 forecast range assumes revenue growth in the mid-single digit range. Revenue from information services grew 9% for the full year, as expected. As a reminder, information services includes STR, real estate manager, our original lender products, and a few smaller information-related products, Thomas Daily and Business Imo in Europe. In 2024, a big piece of this revenue, the STR benchmarking, will move up into CoStar. Also, as we continue to grow our integrated CoStar lender product, more and more of the original lender products residing in information services are also moving into CoStar. This is good news, of course, as we are executing on our strategy to integrate all of the information services products inside the CoStar platform. When the dust settles on all this, we expect information services revenue for 2024 in the range of approximately $130 million to $135 million, with $33 million of revenue in the first quarter. Our real estate manager business is now the largest single component of information services, which we expect to grow in the mid-to-high single digits in 2024 for real estate manager. Other marketplace revenue was $134 million for the full year of 2023, ahead of our expectations for the fourth quarter, with modestly higher transaction revenues from Ten-X. Our subscription marketplace businesses, lands and business for sale, contributed solid double-digit growth, as they do year in and year out. We expect similar outcomes in 2024, with revenue relatively flat to the 2023 overall, and first quarter revenue a little below $30 million. Our 2024 revenue outlook includes double-digit revenue growth in the subscription marketplace businesses, and a rather conservative view, I must say, of Ten-X transaction revenue. We've not built any transaction market recovery assumption into 2024, so if a recovery does materialize in the months ahead, then we should benefit. Residential revenue, I saved the best for last, I can finally talk about forward growth expectations for homes.com. First, to round off on 2023, our residential revenue was $10 million in the fourth quarter, and $44 million for the full year of 2023. In line with our expectations for the legacy Homesnap revenue, and inclusive of a small amount of revenue from the on-the-market acquisition. Our 2024 residential revenue outlook includes three components. These are homes.com, on-the-market, and the legacy residential products, formerly known as Homesnap. Homes.com is generating revenue. I've been waiting three years to say that. I'm just going to have to say it again. Homes.com is generating revenue. I think it definitely felt better the second time. So it was exciting to see our first homes.com membership product putting points on the sales board this year. We have every brand sales team in every city across the country competing to sell homes.com, and this is certainly going to be fun to watch. I think the CoStar team is a little bit salty still from having apartments reach $1 billion in revenue first, and they are currently leading the homes.com top selling contest ahead of apartments. What's fun is that every sales team, no matter how big or small, has a shot at victory. Pound for pound, I'm seeing lands.com sales team is ahead of everyone in terms of net sales per person of homes.com, and their team is one-tenth the size of apartments. Momentum is certainly building, and all nine of our brand sales teams have contributed net new sales for homes.com. Of course, it's very early in the year, and with every salesperson in CoStar incentivized to sell both their core brand products as well as homes.com, it's a bit challenging, as you might imagine, to pin down a sales and revenue outlook by brand this year. Will we sell more homes.com, or will we sell more of our commercial brand products? It's really too early to tell, but I believe we are going to sell a whole lot of both. It's a great problem to have, and regardless of the specific mix of products we sell, we believe that 2024 will be the best net sales year in the company's history by a wide margin. Well, let's look at what happened the last time we took this approach, which was back in February 2015 when we appointed the entire sales force at the launch of apartments.com. As we came into 2015, our total net sales bookings for the company were growing around 15% year-over-year. In 2015, with everyone selling our new apartments.com ad products in addition to their core branded products, our net new bookings increased almost 80%, with sales of all brands growing year-over-year. Now to par with Mr. Florance a few moments ago, we all know that past performance is not indicative of future results. However, there are a number of factors working in our favor with homes.com. We know the size of the residential market opportunity is multiple times bigger than multifamily. We just launched the biggest marketing campaign in real estate history, four times the size of our apartments.com initial marketing campaign. And nobody else in the industry is competing with a “your listing, your lead” business model that doesn't try to take agent commissions, but lets them buy advertising exposure to sell their listings. I think these are all very positive relative to our apartments.com experience back in 2015. So taking our best educated guess, our 2024 forecast assumes revenue contribution from homes.com memberships in the $50 million to $60 million range in 2024, starting from 0 in the first quarter and exiting a year with an approximate $100 million quarterly run rate. Now you might think my forecast looks a bit wimpy as you keep hearing Andy talk about updating our sales efforts every minute over here. But one step at a time, we're just getting started. We expect on the market our new U.K. residential business to deliver approximately $40 million in revenue in 2024. First quarter revenue is expected to be in the $10 million range. The results of on the market were insignificant to our overall financial results in 2023 as the acquisition closed in the middle of December. We expect legacy residential products to continue to decline in 2024 as we sell customers homes.com memberships. We expect full year 2024 revenue of around $20 million from the legacy products. So combining all the components of our residential business, our forecast assumes revenue in the range of $110 million to $120 million in 2024, starting the year with a little over $15 million in the first quarter and growing to over $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Year-over-year total revenue growth is expected to be 150%. And year-over-year organic revenue growth in residential is around 70% in 2024. So to wrap up on 2023, net income was $96 million for the fourth quarter and $375 million for all of 2023, an increase of around $5 million compared to 2022. It's nice to see net income improve while we are in a major investment cycle. And that's thanks to our net interest income, which was an impressive $220 million in 2023. We earned roughly 5% on around a $4.2 billion net cash balance for the year. Let's talk about a few of our performance metrics, first with our sales force, which totaled approximately 1,160 people at the end of the year. With modest increases in 2023, focused on our marketplace businesses of apartments.com and LoopNet. Salesforce expansion in 2024 will be primarily concentrated in our homes.com residential business. Contract renewal rates were 90% in the fourth quarter of 2023. And these remain strong at 95% for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 80% in the prior year. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect full year revenue to range from $2.75 billion to $2.77 billion, implying an annual growth rate of between 12% and 13%. First quarter 2024 revenue is expected to range from $645 million to $650 million, representing revenue growth of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $170 million to $190 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of around 7% for the entire year. First quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to dip slightly into negative territory as we launch our brand marketing campaign ahead of the revenue growth in homes.com. We expect to see positive margins return after the first quarter and grow for the remainder of the year with adjusted EBITDA margins in the 12% to 13% range in the second half of 2024, and exiting much higher than that. Our financial strategy for 2024 is to once again drive operating leverage and profit generation in our commercial businesses while we fund our residential marketplace strategy. We expect to increase profit margins in our commercial portfolio, which should be generating approximately $1.1 billion of profit before investments in homes.com and on the market in 2024. We're off to a strong start with homes.com sales this year with plans to increase our total residential investment levels in 2024 to support the brand launch and build our sales capabilities. 2024 will be the peak net investment year for residential, which includes our full marketing campaign on the market in the U.K. and our teams reaching full strength in content, technology, and sales. Our level of capital expenditures is expected to increase in 2024 from around $150 million in 2023 to around $800 million in 2024 as we enter the big construction years for our Richmond campus and at our new headquarters building in Arlington, Virginia. The operating capital, apart from the building projects, is expected in the $40 million to $45 million range in 2024, which is consistent with the same spending levels in 2023. Our forecast for net interest income, is around $200 million for 2024, which takes into the account our increased capital spend and the possible interest rate reductions in the years ahead. In summary, I'm very proud of the exceptional results we delivered in 2023 during a year complicated by high interest rates, inflation, and continued economic uncertainties. We remain focused on our strategic investment in residential markets while producing record profit levels in established commercial businesses. With monetization of homes.com this year, we're adding another strong double-digit growth revenue stream to our brand portfolio and moving past the peak of the residential investment cycle and onto the next phase of profit growth and profitability improvement for the company. Overall, we're making great progress towards our long-term revenue and profit objectives and remain confident in our ability to grow homes.com to become yet another high margin billion dollar revenue business for CoStar. Having said all that, I think it's time to turn the call back over to our operator for the question and answer session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open.
Pete Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question here. Andy, I guess, top of mind here, I appreciate the sales blitz as you're dedicating the whole team here to get Homes.com onto a great footing. What are you looking towards, I guess, throughout the year to start migrating all the sales activity back to a dedicated sales force? And how are you thinking about cost of acquisition, ongoing cost to serve from a marketing perspective here as you attract new agents to the platform? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Well, thank you for the question, Pete. I just wanted to update you since we came in here and began the call. We're now at $5.3 million. We've sold 58 more accounts.
Scott Wheeler: You need to stop looking at that.
Andrew Florance: Yes, I think I've addicted to that meter. So the -- yes. So we will engage the entire sales force throughout 2024 on selling the product. To be honest with the whole sales force, I believe, wants to participate in selling the product, and I think it works best. So nothing sounds better than when you listen to a salesperson talking to a prospect and saying I'm a couple of blocks away. I just got another update, it doesn't look real. So the it really is effective when someone -- when we can sign these 500,000 accounts to people right in their own neighborhoods, the salesperson can say, Well, I'm 3 blocks away from your office, I come by tomorrow. That it works really well. So it will take us a full year to build up a dedicated Homes.com sales team. I do not believe that this has dramatically more. I think it will be similar to any other product in terms of service and support. It is like Apartments.com. You do have to touch base with the customers, make sure that they're well taken care of and that they understand the performance of their membership. But I would say that in 2025, you would begin to see the shifting back to the general group. But right now, we want speed of sales.
Pete Christiansen: Great. Thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Balsky: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. So I realize it's a big year. You're excited by the launch. I'm excited to hear the next update on the bookings for Homes.com. But can you help us better understand the spend from here? You talked about this being the year of peak spending. So what should we expect kind of as we move out into 2025, 2026, 2027? And the targets that you laid out for 2027, what are your thoughts on them today now that you've officially started to monetize Homes.com? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: Thanks for the question, Heather. I'll give you just some context there. Like I mentioned, the peak net investment this year. As we finalize resource growth, obviously, in sales, you'll see some of those costs annualized forward into 2025 off 2024. But the rest of the cost base is now in 2024 doesn't really move much in the years ahead. So that's really how we're thinking about it, and we think we have plenty of investment here to now be growing the Homes.com business for a long, long time at really strong rates. The update that you're looking forward to next quarter is going to be a fun one because we all want to start drawing those lines around the revenue growth for Homes and how that will perform, which obviously sets us on the track towards those 2027 goals. So I think we'll talk more about that next quarter, but we are still seeing traction towards 2027, and we're committed to still reaching those levels. Too early to tell yet on the revenue leverage rates for Homes.com, which make a big difference as you would expect.
Andrew Florance: With over a week of experience.
Scott Wheeler: With only a week of experience. More to come, but thanks for the question.
Heather Balsky: Thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
George Tong: Hi, thanks good afternoon. You're investing approximately $1 billion in residential this year, which is nearly double the amount of spend from 2023. Can you discuss where the residential investments are going? And then from a margin perspective, we talked about how margins should improve in the back half. Could you give us a little bit more clarity on the margin cadence by quarter as you move through the year?
Scott Wheeler: Sure, George. Let me take the margin cadence question. I mentioned that we'll be in the 12% to 13% in the second half. I think exiting the year, we'll be over 15%, probably 16% going out of the year. And then in the first quarter, we mentioned the minus $8 million to $12 million there, and then we'll take a step between first and third quarter in the second. So you see a steady sequential increase in the margin profile overall for the company. When you look at where the investment going for residential, we've added OnTheMarket and as you watched the announcements around what we're doing there, we committed to putting in around $50 million of marketing that right now has us moving up rather quickly with both listings, traffic and inching up closer towards the number two position. So that's proving to be very valuable right now. And then the rest of the investment is, as you would expect, it's in the Homes.com U.S. business, which is the biggest part is going to be our marketing investments and then followed by the teams that run our content research and technology. So those have been the biggest pieces all along. They'll continue to be the biggest pieces probably in that order as we go forward.
Andrew Florance: And we don't anticipate those growing in the out years. We anticipate them moderating. So we've probably been a bit more aggressive. We have been more aggressive in year 1 than we were with Apartments.com. Apartments.com took two, three years to build up this time we went right at it.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.
Alexei Gogolev: Thank you everyone. Just to clarify the previous comment, Andy. So do you feel like you are front-loading some of the investments that may have initially been planned for 2025 and 2026, you are front-loading it into 2024 in resi?
Andrew Florance: Well, given the fact that more than half of the investment is marketing between the United Kingdom and the United States. I think that's fair to say. So when you look back, I believe, in year one, we spent $40 million in marketing on apartments for branding. So I think we're a touch more aggressive this time around, and that's an understatement. But we are doing that with, I think, a pretty sober eye on the ROI and what we hope to achieve. And I think that it's only a week of sales. It gives you an idea that -- there's a market there. There's a product there, and we think it will enable us to move faster than any competitor expected us to move.
Alexei Gogolev: Understood. Perfect. And Scott, could you help us reconcile the net new bookings figure? I fully recognize that it was a record figure for the year, $286 million. But could you talk a bit more about the dynamic in the fourth quarter and whether there was any cyclicality in there?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Certainly, we see a little bit in the fourth quarter cyclicality on those numbers. I think that the $286 million this year was slightly behind the $300 million or so we made last year, still as you look at the components, Apartments.com is delivering the strongest performance given the vacancy levels in that industry and what that team is able to do. And then CoStar and LoopNet relatively softer in the fourth quarter than what we would have seen previously. And that really makes up the bulk of all of our net revenue. As we get into next year, you'll see less of a drag from the legacy residential products, which also helps us as we add Homes.com to get higher growth in our total company sales next year, which is something that we expect to happen with the sales force and the productivity they can give us right out of the gates here.
Alexei Gogolev: Perfect. Appreciate it. Got it, thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Understanding that the Homes brand campaign is still early innings of seeing how that plays out. But maybe you could elaborate on what flexibility you might maintain around investments this year, depending on how performance evolves? I'm curious if there are specific milestones or circuit breakers you've built in around agent adoption traffic, etcetera, to inform and revisit those plans as the year plays out, whether that's laying on the gas even more or perhaps pulling it back? Just trying to understand how set in stone the investment plans are this year.
Andrew Florance: Sure. From what I can see here in February with a relatively early view of traffic and sales. We're at the -- we're very -- I'm very pleased with our initial results and pleased what we think we see in traffic. So it exceeds -- or it meets and exceeds my best expectation for where we'd be at this point and frankly, pretty excited about it. I don't see a scenario where we accelerate the investment in marketing. I think we went to the -- we put the accelerator to the pedal to the floor and the floor is pretty tough. And I don't think there's any where to go from here. 80 billion impressions or 600 impressions per household is pretty aggressive. We think it will pay off. In terms of circuit breaker going the other way, becoming more conservative, again, we don't see early stage. We don't see any indication of a reason to pull back. We're exceeding our expectations right now dramatically. And so we could, and we do have significant flexibility. So if the unlikely were to happen, we could pull back dramatically but I don't anticipate that being the case. I think the bigger question is, do we moderate the level in 2025 or 2026 based on what we're achieving.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens. Your line is open.
John Campbell: Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. Good afternoon. So Andy, as much as I want to ask you if the Homes.com bookings meter has moved over the last couple of minutes, I'm going to hold off. I'm guessing we're going to get plenty of updates in the quarters ahead. But bigger picture question here, just on the industry kind of legal backdrop. Obviously, a lot of moving parts there. I think it's clear, at least from where I sit, that things seem to be progressing in the favor of Homes.com as far as the value proposition. But what is your take specifically on dual agency, whether you think that's where the market is heading and how you think Homes.com is uniquely positioned to capitalize on that?
Andrew Florance: Sure. So obviously, the legal situation is complex and there are going to be lots of angles and views on that. And we -- I will not be the leading expert on that, but certainly, things are in flux. I know the big broker terms are pursuing settlements. I know the major brokerage firms don't want to fight an extended protracted battle on whether or not sellers should be forced to compensate by our agents. I would not be surprised if there wasn't an outcome where buyers paid their own agent. They can finance that, I believe. I do believe that Homes.com is advantaged competitively for sure in that our revenue model is agnostic to whether or not there is a buyer/broker participation rule in place. Our product is generating buyer/agency leads. It's generating seller leads. It's helping people sell homes with more exposure and more lead generation. And this is unlike any of the competing models that rely on the seller agent having a pre-agreed split with the buyer agent. So if that worked, and again, I don't know what's going to happen, but if it were to shift to the buyer pay and the buyer agent, I would think that we would have significant advantage in funding our business moving forward. I think that some of the competitors have tried to begin to migrate their business to a world in which there's not a buyer broker participation rule, but I believe it requires a level of cannibalization that they haven't yet processed. And what they're doing is sort of half measure at best. So I think we're going to do well and win whatever happens, but I think it would create tailwinds if we ended up with a settlement that required buyers to pay their buyer broker commission. But people like their buyer broker. We're helping people. We are sending hundreds of thousands of leads for buyer brokers -- for buyer brokerage but we'll send seller listing leads. We'll send leads for people buying homes. We'll be here generating leads, and we're not on one side, just one side. We're more diversified than the competitors.
John Campbell: Okay. Makes a lot of sense. And then somewhat related to that, you mentioned sending free leads. When you guys refer to the Homes.com revenue model, you often refer to the term membership. I'm hoping if you could maybe unpack what exactly that means, maybe starting off with the base level of spend? And then what other products and services are kind of included in that “membership”?
Andrew Florance: Sure. Membership is pretty straightforward. It means that you're -- you as an agent, it sold to the agent, and it is priced based upon the sort of transaction volumes you historically do and the price point you operate in and will eventually be based on the market you're in. But it is very price competitive with what has been out there historically. When you are a member, your listings sort higher and have more agent branding on them. You have a number of your listing detailed pages, have more agent branding on it as well as your other listings. When you go to the agent director or the neighborhood page or the school page, the agents who are members sort to the top of those different neighborhood pages, school tenant zone pages, whatnot. We aggressively retarget traffic who are engaging with member listings and agent profiles. So to simplify or not simplify it, but you member might receive, on average, 1.3 million impressions a month for their listings and their agent bio. A non-member, while they get leads for free gets 5,000. So 5,000 versus 1.3 million impressions. There's a significant advantage in being a member. And right now, depending upon the firm, we're seeing an 8 to 14 times increase in lead flow for members if they're sorting to the top of these pages. Where they're getting the most dramatic increase in lead flow is on the agent bio pages. Home buyers will tend to go a couple of pages deep looking for the right home, but home buyers or home sellers are not willing to go past page one or two of agents that they might hire. That's where we see the highest advantage in winning selling listings and winning buyer agency on our site. The good news is it's working.
John Campbell: Very helpful. Thanks Andy.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill down further on the resi monetization, the commentary around $200 million annual recurring bookings continuing at this pace. I was just wondering, as we think about like the agent within that bookings, how are you thinking -- you talked about a wide range there from $100, $200 per month to as much as $7,400. Are there certain kinds of agents that you're targeting? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So we are -- there's 1.6 million agents. I think we're initially targeting 540,000 agents. I think we set a floor -- I won't get the exact number, but I think $30,000, $40,000 annual earnings is what we -- or higher. So it's a pretty broad swath. Price points are from $100, $200 at the lower end, up to tens of thousands of dollars to $100,000 a month for one of these bigger teams with lots of agents on them. I've spent the last week monitoring sales calls, listening to the sort of reaction and the dialogue of the discussion. One of the things I'm very pleased with is that, I would say, overall, though the price points are different, the prospects and buyers have been pretty resonant with what we're doing. So I think we've dialed it in correctly and we'll be refining the strategy as we go through the year. Scott, would you add anything on that?
Scott Wheeler: That's the initial population, of course, that we came out with the targets. And what we're seeing is that the inbound lead flow is very strong from all agents. So our sales force is going after their top prospects in the target list, but also responding to all the leads that are coming in as quickly as possible. And then on top of that, we have our e-commerce channel, which agents can go in and sign up with a few clicks and have all their information and they're ready to go. So all of those are performing well, and we'll continue to expand the group we target. But right out of the gate, we've got a lot to cover quickly.
Andrew Florance: 10 more memberships, another 50,000.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for the color.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Andy for closing remarks.
Andrew Florance: Thank you. Appreciate that. So today, I've got more interested in concluding remarks that I normally have. So I have some news to share with you. Scott Wheeler joined us as our CFO 8 years ago or so. During those 8 years, he's done a fantastic job at the helm of our finance department. We've seen our revenues triple in that time period, and we've gone from strength to strength. I would count Scott more than just a valued colleague. He's become a good friend of mine. As you may know, Scott loves to climb mountains. He was the first father daughter team to summit the tallest mountain in every U.S. state. It wasn't much of an accomplishment in Florida. It was a much bigger accomplishment in Alaska. Scott has accomplished as much as anyone could wish to professionally. So now he's earned the opportunity to retire and pursue his climbing passion in the golden years ahead.
Scott Wheeler: Golden? That was off.
Andrew Florance: Scott will remain with the company until June to facilitate a transition, and I will bring back the other two former CFOs to help in the transition as well. Scott is our third public company CFO with each of our prior CFOs also having served exactly 8-year tenure. We'll begin a search for our 2024 to 2032 CFO immediately. I would have let Scott announce his own retirement, but the last CFO to retire became for Clint when he announced his retirement so I wanted to avoid that awkwardness today. Scott leaves with no disagreements or issue, he simply wants to enjoy the fruits of his labor Godspeed, Scott, and thank you so much. I would like to thank everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter call on April 2023, 2024. Thank you very much for participating. Thank you, Mr. Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I'll cry after the call.
Andrew Florance: You need a tissue, man?
Scott Wheeler: That was kind of you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2024-02-20 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the CoStar Group Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.

Andrew Florance: Fantastic job, Cindy. Thank you. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for CoStar Groups fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings call Total revenue for the full year of 2023 was $2.46 billion, a 13% increase over the full year of 2022 Coming in above the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $640 million or 12% growth year-over-year. This is our 13th year in a row of double-digit revenue growth. We turned in another very strong year in sales in 2023 achieving our second highest net new bookings level ever of $286 million, this performance in the face of higher interest rates and demand shocks that kept property markets distressed in 2023 demonstrates the resilience of our business. Our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA was $492 million and $130 million for the fourth quarter ahead of both the high end of our guidance range and consensus estimates. I'm proud to say that we achieved a major profit milestone in 2023 in our commercial real estate information and marketplace businesses as we deliver adjusted EBITDA margins of 40% for the full year. For the past three years thousands of our team members have worked with professionalism and committed focus to build the new homes.com the premier marketplace for buying, selling and renting homes in the United States. We've conducted dozens of focus groups across the country listening to hundreds of agents, homebuyers and home sellers learning why they were so dissatisfied with the legacy offerings and what they hope for in a better residential portal. We heard loud and clear that brokers, agents, sellers, buyers, and investors all dislike real estate portals that use agent’s listings as bait to draw in homebuyers and then sell them off to other agents as leads with exorbitant commission splits. We learned that homebuyers buy a home in a community not in isolation. So they want quality in-depth information on neighborhood schools, parks, restaurants, and local culture. Our product teams have designed what we believe is clearly the best residential real estate site in the world. The site is clean, powerful, intuitive, appealing, and spam free. Our software developers rose to the challenge and built a lightning-fast reliable platform that met the design specifications perfectly. Good job, Jerry and Zach and crew. Our content team comprised of hundreds of photographers, drone pilots, writers, voiceover talent, musicians, geographers, and video editors captured the essence of tens of thousands of U.S. neighborhoods, schools, and parks. Our dream team drew 2.6 million miles, captured 1.5 million images, shot 3.8 million video clips, and conducted over 350,000 drone flights. This investment creates an experience that consumers love, strengthens our SEO traffic position, and provides a significant advantage over competitive sites. Our efforts to grow traffic on homes.com in 2023 were a big success. Homes.com was the fastest growing real estate website at the end of 2023 with over 600% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter according to Google Analytics. Our residential network traffic in the fourth quarter totaled 95 million average monthly unique visitors growing 94% year-over-year. We were easily in second place in traffic by this measure, well ahead of the 66 million average monthly unique visitors at realtor.com reported two weeks ago. Our largest competitors Realtor and Zillow reported either flat or declining traffic in the fourth quarter of 2023. I believe we will be able to report even stronger traffic numbers in the near future. After building the site and traffic for over two years, last week we launched a massive marketing campaign for homes.com with four commercials during the Super Bowl, an event that was watched by an estimated 123 million viewers. We ran a clever apartments.com commercial in the first quarter with Invading Aliens to set Jeff Goldblum up for a memorable cameo in the first homes.com ad in the second quarter connecting the two brands. In the spots Dan Levy plays the nephew inheriting his uncle's business homes.com and he sets out to reinvent the company and make it better than ever. He is supported by his hesitant sidekick played by SNL's Heidi Garner. The spots draw attention to the value of our neighborhood and school data that we offer home shoppers. The Super Bowl was only the kick-off. In the week following the Super Bowl we generated an estimated 560 million impressions across prime broadcast TV, syndicated TV, cable TV, morning shows, late-night shows, major streaming audio and video platforms, and of course on Google in various forms. During the course of the year we will be in the Olympics, the Oscars, the Emmys, March Madness, the U.S. Open, the Stanley Cup playoffs, Major League Baseball and much more. We believe that we will generate approximately $80 billion each in 90% of U.S. households with our message in 2024. We believe that no other competitor is investing close to what we're investing in this effort. We believe we can grow share. We believe that we have a better product and can significantly shift share and create a very attractive ROI for our investors. While we have excellent traffic numbers, we do not yet have the unaided awareness we need to sustain the top traffic position and to draw the volume of advertisers we seek. As we did with apartments.com, our plan is to grow unaided awareness from the low single digits to more than 50%. That process will take time, but we believe that it will drive brand awareness, SEO, SEM efficiency, traffic, audience, customer demand, and revenue. On Monday, February 12th, the day after the Super Bowl, we were ready to begin monetizing homes.com, selling memberships to agents a quarter earlier than we had previously communicated to you. As we did when we launched the new LoopNet, the new apartments and the new apartments.com, we deployed the entire CoStar Group sales force to sell homes.com. Our goal is to catapult our growth forward and quickly capitalize on the momentum and exposure generated from our marketing campaign. Our 1,000 plus person sales force gives us instant national reach with experienced sales people that live in many of the very same neighborhoods as the 1.5 million residential property agents that we intend to reach. We trained the full sales team in January and rolled out very attractive incentive structures that reward our sellers to sell both homes and their primary brands like CoStar or apartments along with homes. The more they sell of both brands combined, the more money they make. In addition to leveraging the strength of our entire CoStar Group sales team, we are rapidly building a sales force dedicated to selling only homes.com. We've recruited a vice president, sales managers, and 100 sellers to date and intend to have over 300 account sales representatives in place by the end of the year. The response to our sales effort is phenomenal. From a standing start, we sold almost 5.2 million. It was 5 million half an hour ago. 5.2 million annualized subscription revenue in just a little over a week. From a modest start on Monday, our sales climbed each day and by Friday, we were selling $1.1 million in memberships in a single day. We've sold more than 827 memberships so far with approximately 90% of the agents selecting 12-month memberships with the rest choosing a six-month subscription. We've seen agents with larger portfolios signing up at price points in the thousands of dollars a month, so far topping out at $7,400 a month. We have proposals out at much higher price points. We also have agents with just a listing or so signing up at price points of only $100 to $200 a month. It doesn't matter if you're an agent with a large portfolio or small portfolio. Either way, we're charging a small fraction of the serious ridiculously high 30% to 40% of commissions being charged by Zillow and Realtor.com to agents. We have only demoed 0.02% of the agents out there at this point. If we maintain this pace, we could sell around $200 million in annual reoccurring revenue in our first 12 months of selling. The great news is that agents are definitely willing to spend for advertising exposure and they absolutely love the Homes.com 'your listing, your lead' business model. Our direct field sales team, telephone sales teams, and e-commerce sales channels are all producing results. We are initially focused on approximately 500,000 of the 1.5 million agents in the country. The annual revenue potential of this initial pool of agents for a basic homes.com membership is over $2.5 billion. Knowing that apartments.com basic silver ads comprise around 25% of all apartments.com listings, if this same ratio were to apply to homes.com, then the potential opportunity could be as high as $10 billion. Overall, I'm very proud of what the team has worked so hard to accomplish with homes.com in only three years and believe it will be the most successful product launch in CoStar Group history. This coming year also marks a turning point as we've reached the peak year of our residential investment. With sales and revenue growing in the months ahead, we expect overall company profit levels to increase each quarter throughout the year and for the foreseeable future. In December, we successfully closed our acquisition of OnTheMarket in the United Kingdom for £100 million. We believe that at the time of the acquisition of OnTheMarket, we believe that the time of the acquisition of OnTheMarket was one of the top three residential portals in the U.K. £100 million is 2% of the current leading portal, Rightmove's £4.4 billion market cap. Rightmove currently has significantly more traffic than OnTheMarket, so a top priority for us is to grow the appeal of the site for homebuyers and sellers and grow traffic. Just one month in, we're making huge progress, increasing January 2024 site traffic to OnTheMarket by 81% year-over-year, according to Google Analytics. We didn't waste time. We believe that we are now the fastest growing residential portal in the U.K. As our traffic has grown, our leads have also grown 81% since December of 2023. Rightmove announced at their recent investor day that they plan to grow revenue per agent by 42% to over £2,000 per agent per month over the next five years. That is 10 times what OnTheMarket charges agents today. Rightmove is also committed to maintaining at least 70% profit margin levels through 2028, leaving them little room for investing in product and technology. You simply cannot make this stuff up, but you have to love it. In sharp contrast, we plan to continue CoStar's longstanding strategy of investing and partnering with agents in the industry to generate and attract high intent leads at a fraction of the cost of other U.K. portals while still achieving an attractive margin. Agents are telling us that they're in search of an alternative to Rightmove's unfriendly agent listing fees and are supportive of OnTheMarket. Since acquisition, we have added over 1,000 agent advertisers and 57,000 listings to the site, again, in a matter of two months. Our long-term intention is to create the number one property portal in the U.K. by combining CoStar's marketing and traffic generation expertise, the market-leading technology we've developed in homes.com, CoStar's research and content generation capabilities, and the strength of our established commercial real estate platform in the U.K. The European residential market opportunity is estimated to be $17 billion, and we intend to build and expand our share of the residential opportunity in Europe, beginning with OnTheMarket. Apartments.com had a phenomenal year. Revenue for the year was $914 million, or 23% growth over 2022. This is almost $170 million of incremental annual revenue, the largest contribution ever for any of our brands. As of January this year, Apartments.com is now not only the largest business by revenue at CoStar, but also officially our first billion-dollar revenue run rate business. But here comes CoStar right behind it, and then homes. The sales team delivered exceptional results at Apartments.com in 2023, with annualized net new bookings growing 34% over 2022. We now have almost 71,000 communities advertising their availabilities on Apartments.com, which is 11% above the fourth quarter of 2022, and almost twice that of our nearest competitor. Our highly productive sales team conducted over 623,000 quality meetings in 2023, which was 37% higher than in 2022, and a new record. Our customers love our sales team, rewarding them with a 94% net promoter score rating for the full year of 2023. We continue to expand our mid-market sales effort by growing our sales team and developing targeted product offerings that suit the needs of mid-sized communities. Net productivity for our sales team increased by 14% in 2023, as compared to 2022, which resulted in a 44% growth in properties under 50 units advertising on Apartments.com. The opportunity in the small property sector is massive at almost $7 billion, and our penetration in this sector is still below 5%. Our award-winning marketing campaign, featuring the wonderful and very funny Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, inventor of the Apartminternet, entertained audiences and delivered over 12 billion media impressions and almost 1 billion visits to our websites during the year. We jump-started our 2024 media campaign with a Super Bowl ad. This is year 10 of our brand-building marketing campaign since we launched Apartments.com back in 2015. This consistent, long-term brand marketing strategy continues to prove successful as we finish the year with 52% unaided brand awareness, with renters in the fourth quarter 6 percentage points above our closest competitor. Based on a recent study by market research firm Market Connections, industry decision makers representing 15,000 communities named Apartments.com as the most widely used advertising solution at 74%. The research also found that Apartments.com was the most well-known advertising solution, beating our closest competitor by 25%. The Apartments.com brand is stronger than it's ever been, delivering almost a billion visits to our websites and 43 million average monthly unique visitors during 2023, according to Google Analytics. Our customers care about the number of potential renters utilizing our site every month to find a place to live, making unique visitors a key metric. For the past eight quarters in a row, Apartments.com held the number one position in terms of monthly average unique visitors when comparing our traffic to Zillow's publicly disclosed average monthly unique visitors. Overall economic conditions are expected to remain favorable for rental property advertising. Vacancy rates increased in 2023 for three to five-star properties by 160 basis points to 9.1%, and are expected to increase in 2024 as new unit deliveries are expected to remain high in 2024 at approximately 470,000 units. We expect to see Apartments.com generate strong double-digit revenue growth in 2024, somewhere in the high teens or more, which is balanced to some degree by the level of Homes.com sales effort that's top-performing advertising Juggernaut delivers in 2024. CoStar delivered another strong quarter with revenues of $925 million and 11% year-over-year growth rate. Fourth quarter, revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $238 million. We have never seen this level of positive revenue growth for CoStar while we're at the bottom of a severe property market downturn. The strength of CoStar continues to be our ability to expand the information, content, and analytic capabilities in the product to diversify into bigger and broader customer sets, like owners, lenders, and corporate tenants. In 2023, we sold twice as much to the owner, lender, and corporate tenant sectors than we did to brokers. Net sales in the fourth quarter to owner, lender, and tenant customers grew almost 30% compared to the third quarter of this year. The CoStar lender product had an exceptional year in 2023, nearly doubling our customer base and delivering over five times the revenue that we realized in 2022. We now have over 1,000 active users for our lender product. Our opportunity pipeline is large, with over 300 institutions progressing through our sales process. Our competitive data advantage has helped us win virtually every deal versus the main competitors in this space, including winning seven of the largest CRE lenders in the industry. Looking ahead, there is significant opportunity to expand the CoStar lender addressable market beyond our initial focus on depository institutions. As regional banks and credit unions tighten up their credit lending requirements, their commercial lending requirements, private lenders are stepping in to fill the void. We believe the total addressable market for our expanded target customer set is over 600 million. We are currently serving less than 15% of this opportunity and have plans to increase our sales and product teams to accelerate our growth next year. We released our hospitality benchmarking product in the CoStar platform in 2023 and are rapidly migrating our SDR customer base into the CoStar environment. Over 600 customers are now using the benchmark product in CoStar, with the remaining customers to be migrated in the first half of 2024. More than 18,000 users are now in CoStar managing their hotel's performance and optimizing their revenue through the reimagined tools and additional analytic capabilities. As a result of the movement of SDR benchmarking at CoStar, revenues from our hospitality benchmark subscriptions will now be reported as part of CoStar, similar to our integrated approach of our lender products for financial institutions being CoStar. The transition of SDR benchmarking to CoStar in 2024 is a major milestone for our roadmap to build the full suite of SDR product capabilities in CoStar. We plan to incorporate forward booking information, complete P&L benchmarking, and international market performance this year and the next. SDR overall had an incredible year. 2023 revenue grew 13% over last year, delivering the highest annual ever result since we bought SDR in 2019. The team had a record sales quarter to end the year, growing 54% over the fourth quarter of last year. Subscription revenue grew 17% in 2023 over the prior year and now makes up 81% of the overall revenue, the highest percentage since the acquisition. SDR's quarterly renewal rate is now in a very impressive 98%. With the full capability of CoStar and SDR combined, we expect to unlock increased value for our customers and grow strong double-digit revenue towards what we believe is a 300 million hospitality market opportunity. Overall, we remain very confident in the strength and value of CoStar's platform and our growth performance in the downturn. Renewal rates for CoStar remain rock solid at 92% and we're seeing early indications of increased leasing and sales activity as we move into the first quarter of 2024. Although it's too early to call a recovery in the property markets, we expect solid mid-single digit revenue growth from CoStar in 2024. LoopNet revenue was $265 million in 2023, up 15% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range. Signature listings, signature ad listings were up 11% in the fourth quarter, delivering more traffic and leads to our customers. International revenue in the fourth quarter was up 33% and net new bookings were up 186% over the fourth quarter of 2022. LoopNet continues to be the number one listing site for commercial properties. Average monthly unique visitors to the global network in the fourth quarter were up 11% year-over-year and was seven times the traffic of the next largest competitor. In the U.K., LoopNet is now the number one dedicated commercial property marketplace by traffic after launching only a little over a year ago. We continue to expand internationally given our success to date and the size of the opportunity. We plan to launch LoopNet in France and Spain in 2024. In -- 2023 was a year of growth for LoopNet sales team. At the end of 2022, only 40% of the sales were managed by LoopNet dedicated sales representatives and we've now effectively transitioned to 80% of those accounts from CoStar reps to LoopNet reps. The LoopNet sales team is focused on ramping up activity, face-to-face meetings and MPS scores following the success formula of apartments.com. As a result, we expect to deliver increased sales productivity and bookings as we move through 2024. Ten-X continues to demonstrate the value of our digital sales platform for our commercial properties. In a year when sales transactions were down 49%, Ten-X brought $4.5 billion in assets to the platform, which was a modest decline of 9% relative to the market's steeper decline. We delivered a 52% trade rate in 2023, nearly double the offline trade rate, but below the rates we achieved in 2022. Overall, Ten-X revenue finished the year around 20% below prior year levels. Despite this decline, we increased our share of property sales in the $1million to $10 million asset category during the year, moving more transactions from offline to online. The market outlook for the coming year remains uncertain, although interest rates have stabilized near-term, bid-ask spreads and debt constraints remain a challenge. Regardless of these uncertainties, in the first 45 days of 2024, our trade rate and number of bidders per asset have increased from the fourth quarter of 2023 levels. There are still billions of dollars of transactions occurring each year in the $1 billion to $10 billion asset category, which we continue to pursue as part of what we believe is a $3 billion long-term market opportunity. The real estate capital markets in the fourth quarter continue to be impacted by higher borrowing costs, tight lending standards, and deteriorating real estate fundamentals. In 2023, transaction volumes were down 49% and price declines ranged from 10% to 35% across all sectors. Banks continue to slow their loan growth as property fundamentals decline and delinquencies rise. With interest rates expected to decline later this year, current expectations are for sales volumes to increase compared to last year. We saw some early indications in January with sales volumes rising 6.4%. The office sector continues to be the most challenged with 58 million square feet of negative absorption in 2023. Absorption since the pandemic now sits at negative 178 million square feet. Office attendance is 60% of what it was before 2020, though that understates demand since hybrid work requires higher peak use. The market sits at a record high 13.5% vacancy rate. A silver lining is the decline in construction starts, which we predict will eventually result in a shortage of premium office space. Since our 15-year lease at our Washington DC headquarters location is set to expire in 2025, we assess more than 25 viable sites in the greater Washington DC metro area. We ultimately decided to purchase a five-star trophy LEED Platinum office building located at 1201 Wilson Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia. We were able to purchase the building and the land lease for a significant discount to both recent valuations and current replacement costs. We also received nearly $7 million in both tax and economic incentives. While past performance does not ensure future performance, you might recall that back in 2010 during the great financial crisis, we acquired our 1331 L Street location for $42 million, a then significant discount to replacement costs, and sold it within two years and the sale lease back for $101 million, more than twice what we bought it for. We are betting that the office market is at a Nadar [ph] again. We will likely execute a sales lease back on 1201 Wilson Boulevard at some point in the future. The industrial sector has also seen a historic wave of new construction push vacancies up from all-time lows, but at 5.7%, industrial vacancies are still at half their peak levels. Industrial demand has remained positive, though, and the rise in vacancies should be mitigated by a pullback in construction starts in the second half of 2023. The retail sector continued to be the best performing in the fourth quarter with both positive absorption and limited new construction. The result was vacancy rates dropping to 4%, an all-time low. Conditions should remain healthy for retail with under construction at near all-time level lows. The U.S. hotel sector ended the year with RevPAR growth of 4.9%, outpacing inflation and being driven by ADR growth of 4.3% and occupancy growth of 0.6%. Robust group demand and corporate transient demand were the primary contributors to growth. RevPAR is expected to continue to outpace inflation in 2024 with 4.1% growth projected. In the U.S. residential sector, mortgage rates have come down from 7.8% to 6.6%, but rates are still high enough to prevent homeowners from selling, creating low inventory of homes for sale, and low levels of homes being sold. But if interest rates continue to drop, affordability will improve, and even a drop to 6% would mean home ownership would become affordable for an additional 37 million Americans. In the context of a distressed commercial real estate market, CoStar turned in an outstanding performance in 2023, growing revenue 13% with record levels of profitability in our CRE business. It is clear that CoStar Group's diversified subscription business is highly resilient in a distressed property cycle. We believe that we will improve profits and margins again in 2024 to $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA with 42% margins. Our entire team has worked extraordinarily hard in building the Homes.com platform and business. We believe that we just launched CoStar Group's next transformative billion-dollar business. In the conversations we are having with brokerage leaders, and agents, they tell us they are 100% behind our year-list and year-lead business model, but it gets better for brokers, agents, homebuyers, and home sellers. I am thrilled to see that support with $5.2 million in annualized subscription sales in just the first six business days of selling Homes.com. The first half of 2024 is the peak investment for Homes.com, and we believe profits and margins will start showing significant growth in the second half of 2024. After my brief remarks, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler. Are you still there, Scott?
Scott Wheeler: Still here. Ready to go. Thank you for those brief remarks. Okay. So clearly 2023 was a very strong year for the company, but that sure feels like a long time ago, doesn't it? These last few weeks have really been like turning a page when you get into the launch of Homes.com, the advertising brand campaign, the selling efforts. I think 2024 is going to be a great year. I can already tell. But first, let's wrap up on 2023. The full-year revenue growth was an impressive 13% versus prior year, which was ahead of our guidance and forecast. What I found interesting was that 2023 was the 13th consecutive year of double-digit growth, and we grew 13%. Did you know that? And last year, when our 12th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, we grew 12%. I wonder what that means this year. We'll see. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, but we actually turned in a great revenue performance in 2023. Profit results also came in above expectations, with full-year adjusted EBITDA at $492 million and 20% margin, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. What I think most is impressive is that you can still see our core CoStar business delivering 40% profit margins and a record high, 45% in the fourth quarter, before you consider the investments we're making moving into the residential sector. I think it's important we keep an eye on the underlying strength of this business portfolio as we exit the investment phase of Homes.com particularly, and we'll expect profitability to increase, as Andy mentioned, once again as we move through 2024. So looking at our revenue by our different businesses, Apartments.com grew 23% in the fourth quarter and the full year, in line with our expectations. Apartments.com added twice the amount of revenue in 2023 than its nearest competitor, and increased revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 sequentially over the third quarter, which demonstrates both the strength of our product platform and our 97% subscription model in Apartments.com. Now, our competitors are still in the game of chasing transaction revenue, which is why their revenue cycle is up in the middle of the year and then drops back in the fourth quarter. These transactions sure feel good during an upswing in market demand, but will leave you weak and unable to invest in a cyclical downturn. We expect Apartments.com revenue growth rates somewhere in the 17% to 18% range for the full year of 2024, and we're estimating 20% revenue growth for the first quarter. We expect our renewal pricing levels to moderate this coming year as inflation in the economy has come down. Also, we continue to grow aggressively in the smaller property space, which carries lower price points relative to institutional scale communities. We're going to see increased levels of productivity in 2024 for our large and more experienced salesforce and apartments. Now, the question is, will this increased output benefit Apartments or Homes.com? So far, this sales team is proving very effective at selling both. CoStar revenue grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year of 2023 at the top end of our full year guidance range. As Andy mentioned, in 2024, we will report STR benchmarking revenue in CoStar, as the STR product is now fully integrated in the CoStar platform and customer migrations will be complete this year. Including our benchmarking revenue, we expect full year and first quarter CoStar revenue growth in the range of 11% to 12%. So in 2024, CoStar will become our second brand business, producing over $1 billion in revenue. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the STR revenue shift, we expect CoStar revenue growth of between 7% to 8% consistent with what we indicated in our third quarter earnings call back in October. LoopNet revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter, exceeding our 11% guidance. Revenue for the full year was $265 million, or a 15% increase over prior year, at the top end of our guidance range of 14% to 15%. We expect to see first quarter LoopNet revenue growth in the range of 8% to 9%, as the sales results for LoopNet in the fourth quarter were lower than earlier in the year, following the full account transitions from CoStar to LoopNet. We expect our LoopNet sales team to make meaningful contributions to selling both LoopNet and Homes.com in 2024. So accordingly, our LoopNet 2024 forecast range assumes revenue growth in the mid-single digit range. Revenue from information services grew 9% for the full year, as expected. As a reminder, information services includes STR, real estate manager, our original lender products, and a few smaller information-related products, Thomas Daily and Business Imo in Europe. In 2024, a big piece of this revenue, the STR benchmarking, will move up into CoStar. Also, as we continue to grow our integrated CoStar lender product, more and more of the original lender products residing in information services are also moving into CoStar. This is good news, of course, as we are executing on our strategy to integrate all of the information services products inside the CoStar platform. When the dust settles on all this, we expect information services revenue for 2024 in the range of approximately $130 million to $135 million, with $33 million of revenue in the first quarter. Our real estate manager business is now the largest single component of information services, which we expect to grow in the mid-to-high single digits in 2024 for real estate manager. Other marketplace revenue was $134 million for the full year of 2023, ahead of our expectations for the fourth quarter, with modestly higher transaction revenues from Ten-X. Our subscription marketplace businesses, lands and business for sale, contributed solid double-digit growth, as they do year in and year out. We expect similar outcomes in 2024, with revenue relatively flat to the 2023 overall, and first quarter revenue a little below $30 million. Our 2024 revenue outlook includes double-digit revenue growth in the subscription marketplace businesses, and a rather conservative view, I must say, of Ten-X transaction revenue. We've not built any transaction market recovery assumption into 2024, so if a recovery does materialize in the months ahead, then we should benefit. Residential revenue, I saved the best for last, I can finally talk about forward growth expectations for homes.com. First, to round off on 2023, our residential revenue was $10 million in the fourth quarter, and $44 million for the full year of 2023. In line with our expectations for the legacy Homesnap revenue, and inclusive of a small amount of revenue from the on-the-market acquisition. Our 2024 residential revenue outlook includes three components. These are homes.com, on-the-market, and the legacy residential products, formerly known as Homesnap. Homes.com is generating revenue. I've been waiting three years to say that. I'm just going to have to say it again. Homes.com is generating revenue. I think it definitely felt better the second time. So it was exciting to see our first homes.com membership product putting points on the sales board this year. We have every brand sales team in every city across the country competing to sell homes.com, and this is certainly going to be fun to watch. I think the CoStar team is a little bit salty still from having apartments reach $1 billion in revenue first, and they are currently leading the homes.com top selling contest ahead of apartments. What's fun is that every sales team, no matter how big or small, has a shot at victory. Pound for pound, I'm seeing lands.com sales team is ahead of everyone in terms of net sales per person of homes.com, and their team is one-tenth the size of apartments. Momentum is certainly building, and all nine of our brand sales teams have contributed net new sales for homes.com. Of course, it's very early in the year, and with every salesperson in CoStar incentivized to sell both their core brand products as well as homes.com, it's a bit challenging, as you might imagine, to pin down a sales and revenue outlook by brand this year. Will we sell more homes.com, or will we sell more of our commercial brand products? It's really too early to tell, but I believe we are going to sell a whole lot of both. It's a great problem to have, and regardless of the specific mix of products we sell, we believe that 2024 will be the best net sales year in the company's history by a wide margin. Well, let's look at what happened the last time we took this approach, which was back in February 2015 when we appointed the entire sales force at the launch of apartments.com. As we came into 2015, our total net sales bookings for the company were growing around 15% year-over-year. In 2015, with everyone selling our new apartments.com ad products in addition to their core branded products, our net new bookings increased almost 80%, with sales of all brands growing year-over-year. Now to par with Mr. Florance a few moments ago, we all know that past performance is not indicative of future results. However, there are a number of factors working in our favor with homes.com. We know the size of the residential market opportunity is multiple times bigger than multifamily. We just launched the biggest marketing campaign in real estate history, four times the size of our apartments.com initial marketing campaign. And nobody else in the industry is competing with a “your listing, your lead” business model that doesn't try to take agent commissions, but lets them buy advertising exposure to sell their listings. I think these are all very positive relative to our apartments.com experience back in 2015. So taking our best educated guess, our 2024 forecast assumes revenue contribution from homes.com memberships in the $50 million to $60 million range in 2024, starting from 0 in the first quarter and exiting a year with an approximate $100 million quarterly run rate. Now you might think my forecast looks a bit wimpy as you keep hearing Andy talk about updating our sales efforts every minute over here. But one step at a time, we're just getting started. We expect on the market our new U.K. residential business to deliver approximately $40 million in revenue in 2024. First quarter revenue is expected to be in the $10 million range. The results of on the market were insignificant to our overall financial results in 2023 as the acquisition closed in the middle of December. We expect legacy residential products to continue to decline in 2024 as we sell customers homes.com memberships. We expect full year 2024 revenue of around $20 million from the legacy products. So combining all the components of our residential business, our forecast assumes revenue in the range of $110 million to $120 million in 2024, starting the year with a little over $15 million in the first quarter and growing to over $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Year-over-year total revenue growth is expected to be 150%. And year-over-year organic revenue growth in residential is around 70% in 2024. So to wrap up on 2023, net income was $96 million for the fourth quarter and $375 million for all of 2023, an increase of around $5 million compared to 2022. It's nice to see net income improve while we are in a major investment cycle. And that's thanks to our net interest income, which was an impressive $220 million in 2023. We earned roughly 5% on around a $4.2 billion net cash balance for the year. Let's talk about a few of our performance metrics, first with our sales force, which totaled approximately 1,160 people at the end of the year. With modest increases in 2023, focused on our marketplace businesses of apartments.com and LoopNet. Salesforce expansion in 2024 will be primarily concentrated in our homes.com residential business. Contract renewal rates were 90% in the fourth quarter of 2023. And these remain strong at 95% for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 80% in the prior year. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect full year revenue to range from $2.75 billion to $2.77 billion, implying an annual growth rate of between 12% and 13%. First quarter 2024 revenue is expected to range from $645 million to $650 million, representing revenue growth of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $170 million to $190 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of around 7% for the entire year. First quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to dip slightly into negative territory as we launch our brand marketing campaign ahead of the revenue growth in homes.com. We expect to see positive margins return after the first quarter and grow for the remainder of the year with adjusted EBITDA margins in the 12% to 13% range in the second half of 2024, and exiting much higher than that. Our financial strategy for 2024 is to once again drive operating leverage and profit generation in our commercial businesses while we fund our residential marketplace strategy. We expect to increase profit margins in our commercial portfolio, which should be generating approximately $1.1 billion of profit before investments in homes.com and on the market in 2024. We're off to a strong start with homes.com sales this year with plans to increase our total residential investment levels in 2024 to support the brand launch and build our sales capabilities. 2024 will be the peak net investment year for residential, which includes our full marketing campaign on the market in the U.K. and our teams reaching full strength in content, technology, and sales. Our level of capital expenditures is expected to increase in 2024 from around $150 million in 2023 to around $800 million in 2024 as we enter the big construction years for our Richmond campus and at our new headquarters building in Arlington, Virginia. The operating capital, apart from the building projects, is expected in the $40 million to $45 million range in 2024, which is consistent with the same spending levels in 2023. Our forecast for net interest income, is around $200 million for 2024, which takes into the account our increased capital spend and the possible interest rate reductions in the years ahead. In summary, I'm very proud of the exceptional results we delivered in 2023 during a year complicated by high interest rates, inflation, and continued economic uncertainties. We remain focused on our strategic investment in residential markets while producing record profit levels in established commercial businesses. With monetization of homes.com this year, we're adding another strong double-digit growth revenue stream to our brand portfolio and moving past the peak of the residential investment cycle and onto the next phase of profit growth and profitability improvement for the company. Overall, we're making great progress towards our long-term revenue and profit objectives and remain confident in our ability to grow homes.com to become yet another high margin billion dollar revenue business for CoStar. Having said all that, I think it's time to turn the call back over to our operator for the question and answer session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open.
Pete Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question here. Andy, I guess, top of mind here, I appreciate the sales blitz as you're dedicating the whole team here to get Homes.com onto a great footing. What are you looking towards, I guess, throughout the year to start migrating all the sales activity back to a dedicated sales force? And how are you thinking about cost of acquisition, ongoing cost to serve from a marketing perspective here as you attract new agents to the platform? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Well, thank you for the question, Pete. I just wanted to update you since we came in here and began the call. We're now at $5.3 million. We've sold 58 more accounts.
Scott Wheeler: You need to stop looking at that.
Andrew Florance: Yes, I think I've addicted to that meter. So the -- yes. So we will engage the entire sales force throughout 2024 on selling the product. To be honest with the whole sales force, I believe, wants to participate in selling the product, and I think it works best. So nothing sounds better than when you listen to a salesperson talking to a prospect and saying I'm a couple of blocks away. I just got another update, it doesn't look real. So the it really is effective when someone -- when we can sign these 500,000 accounts to people right in their own neighborhoods, the salesperson can say, Well, I'm 3 blocks away from your office, I come by tomorrow. That it works really well. So it will take us a full year to build up a dedicated Homes.com sales team. I do not believe that this has dramatically more. I think it will be similar to any other product in terms of service and support. It is like Apartments.com. You do have to touch base with the customers, make sure that they're well taken care of and that they understand the performance of their membership. But I would say that in 2025, you would begin to see the shifting back to the general group. But right now, we want speed of sales.
Pete Christiansen: Great. Thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Heather Balsky: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. So I realize it's a big year. You're excited by the launch. I'm excited to hear the next update on the bookings for Homes.com. But can you help us better understand the spend from here? You talked about this being the year of peak spending. So what should we expect kind of as we move out into 2025, 2026, 2027? And the targets that you laid out for 2027, what are your thoughts on them today now that you've officially started to monetize Homes.com? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: Thanks for the question, Heather. I'll give you just some context there. Like I mentioned, the peak net investment this year. As we finalize resource growth, obviously, in sales, you'll see some of those costs annualized forward into 2025 off 2024. But the rest of the cost base is now in 2024 doesn't really move much in the years ahead. So that's really how we're thinking about it, and we think we have plenty of investment here to now be growing the Homes.com business for a long, long time at really strong rates. The update that you're looking forward to next quarter is going to be a fun one because we all want to start drawing those lines around the revenue growth for Homes and how that will perform, which obviously sets us on the track towards those 2027 goals. So I think we'll talk more about that next quarter, but we are still seeing traction towards 2027, and we're committed to still reaching those levels. Too early to tell yet on the revenue leverage rates for Homes.com, which make a big difference as you would expect.
Andrew Florance: With over a week of experience.
Scott Wheeler: With only a week of experience. More to come, but thanks for the question.
Heather Balsky: Thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
George Tong: Hi, thanks good afternoon. You're investing approximately $1 billion in residential this year, which is nearly double the amount of spend from 2023. Can you discuss where the residential investments are going? And then from a margin perspective, we talked about how margins should improve in the back half. Could you give us a little bit more clarity on the margin cadence by quarter as you move through the year?
Scott Wheeler: Sure, George. Let me take the margin cadence question. I mentioned that we'll be in the 12% to 13% in the second half. I think exiting the year, we'll be over 15%, probably 16% going out of the year. And then in the first quarter, we mentioned the minus $8 million to $12 million there, and then we'll take a step between first and third quarter in the second. So you see a steady sequential increase in the margin profile overall for the company. When you look at where the investment going for residential, we've added OnTheMarket and as you watched the announcements around what we're doing there, we committed to putting in around $50 million of marketing that right now has us moving up rather quickly with both listings, traffic and inching up closer towards the number two position. So that's proving to be very valuable right now. And then the rest of the investment is, as you would expect, it's in the Homes.com U.S. business, which is the biggest part is going to be our marketing investments and then followed by the teams that run our content research and technology. So those have been the biggest pieces all along. They'll continue to be the biggest pieces probably in that order as we go forward.
Andrew Florance: And we don't anticipate those growing in the out years. We anticipate them moderating. So we've probably been a bit more aggressive. We have been more aggressive in year 1 than we were with Apartments.com. Apartments.com took two, three years to build up this time we went right at it.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.
Alexei Gogolev: Thank you everyone. Just to clarify the previous comment, Andy. So do you feel like you are front-loading some of the investments that may have initially been planned for 2025 and 2026, you are front-loading it into 2024 in resi?
Andrew Florance: Well, given the fact that more than half of the investment is marketing between the United Kingdom and the United States. I think that's fair to say. So when you look back, I believe, in year one, we spent $40 million in marketing on apartments for branding. So I think we're a touch more aggressive this time around, and that's an understatement. But we are doing that with, I think, a pretty sober eye on the ROI and what we hope to achieve. And I think that it's only a week of sales. It gives you an idea that -- there's a market there. There's a product there, and we think it will enable us to move faster than any competitor expected us to move.
Alexei Gogolev: Understood. Perfect. And Scott, could you help us reconcile the net new bookings figure? I fully recognize that it was a record figure for the year, $286 million. But could you talk a bit more about the dynamic in the fourth quarter and whether there was any cyclicality in there?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Certainly, we see a little bit in the fourth quarter cyclicality on those numbers. I think that the $286 million this year was slightly behind the $300 million or so we made last year, still as you look at the components, Apartments.com is delivering the strongest performance given the vacancy levels in that industry and what that team is able to do. And then CoStar and LoopNet relatively softer in the fourth quarter than what we would have seen previously. And that really makes up the bulk of all of our net revenue. As we get into next year, you'll see less of a drag from the legacy residential products, which also helps us as we add Homes.com to get higher growth in our total company sales next year, which is something that we expect to happen with the sales force and the productivity they can give us right out of the gates here.
Alexei Gogolev: Perfect. Appreciate it. Got it, thank you.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Understanding that the Homes brand campaign is still early innings of seeing how that plays out. But maybe you could elaborate on what flexibility you might maintain around investments this year, depending on how performance evolves? I'm curious if there are specific milestones or circuit breakers you've built in around agent adoption traffic, etcetera, to inform and revisit those plans as the year plays out, whether that's laying on the gas even more or perhaps pulling it back? Just trying to understand how set in stone the investment plans are this year.
Andrew Florance: Sure. From what I can see here in February with a relatively early view of traffic and sales. We're at the -- we're very -- I'm very pleased with our initial results and pleased what we think we see in traffic. So it exceeds -- or it meets and exceeds my best expectation for where we'd be at this point and frankly, pretty excited about it. I don't see a scenario where we accelerate the investment in marketing. I think we went to the -- we put the accelerator to the pedal to the floor and the floor is pretty tough. And I don't think there's any where to go from here. 80 billion impressions or 600 impressions per household is pretty aggressive. We think it will pay off. In terms of circuit breaker going the other way, becoming more conservative, again, we don't see early stage. We don't see any indication of a reason to pull back. We're exceeding our expectations right now dramatically. And so we could, and we do have significant flexibility. So if the unlikely were to happen, we could pull back dramatically but I don't anticipate that being the case. I think the bigger question is, do we moderate the level in 2025 or 2026 based on what we're achieving.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from John Campbell with Stephens. Your line is open.
John Campbell: Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. Good afternoon. So Andy, as much as I want to ask you if the Homes.com bookings meter has moved over the last couple of minutes, I'm going to hold off. I'm guessing we're going to get plenty of updates in the quarters ahead. But bigger picture question here, just on the industry kind of legal backdrop. Obviously, a lot of moving parts there. I think it's clear, at least from where I sit, that things seem to be progressing in the favor of Homes.com as far as the value proposition. But what is your take specifically on dual agency, whether you think that's where the market is heading and how you think Homes.com is uniquely positioned to capitalize on that?
Andrew Florance: Sure. So obviously, the legal situation is complex and there are going to be lots of angles and views on that. And we -- I will not be the leading expert on that, but certainly, things are in flux. I know the big broker terms are pursuing settlements. I know the major brokerage firms don't want to fight an extended protracted battle on whether or not sellers should be forced to compensate by our agents. I would not be surprised if there wasn't an outcome where buyers paid their own agent. They can finance that, I believe. I do believe that Homes.com is advantaged competitively for sure in that our revenue model is agnostic to whether or not there is a buyer/broker participation rule in place. Our product is generating buyer/agency leads. It's generating seller leads. It's helping people sell homes with more exposure and more lead generation. And this is unlike any of the competing models that rely on the seller agent having a pre-agreed split with the buyer agent. So if that worked, and again, I don't know what's going to happen, but if it were to shift to the buyer pay and the buyer agent, I would think that we would have significant advantage in funding our business moving forward. I think that some of the competitors have tried to begin to migrate their business to a world in which there's not a buyer broker participation rule, but I believe it requires a level of cannibalization that they haven't yet processed. And what they're doing is sort of half measure at best. So I think we're going to do well and win whatever happens, but I think it would create tailwinds if we ended up with a settlement that required buyers to pay their buyer broker commission. But people like their buyer broker. We're helping people. We are sending hundreds of thousands of leads for buyer brokers -- for buyer brokerage but we'll send seller listing leads. We'll send leads for people buying homes. We'll be here generating leads, and we're not on one side, just one side. We're more diversified than the competitors.
John Campbell: Okay. Makes a lot of sense. And then somewhat related to that, you mentioned sending free leads. When you guys refer to the Homes.com revenue model, you often refer to the term membership. I'm hoping if you could maybe unpack what exactly that means, maybe starting off with the base level of spend? And then what other products and services are kind of included in that “membership”?
Andrew Florance: Sure. Membership is pretty straightforward. It means that you're -- you as an agent, it sold to the agent, and it is priced based upon the sort of transaction volumes you historically do and the price point you operate in and will eventually be based on the market you're in. But it is very price competitive with what has been out there historically. When you are a member, your listings sort higher and have more agent branding on them. You have a number of your listing detailed pages, have more agent branding on it as well as your other listings. When you go to the agent director or the neighborhood page or the school page, the agents who are members sort to the top of those different neighborhood pages, school tenant zone pages, whatnot. We aggressively retarget traffic who are engaging with member listings and agent profiles. So to simplify or not simplify it, but you member might receive, on average, 1.3 million impressions a month for their listings and their agent bio. A non-member, while they get leads for free gets 5,000. So 5,000 versus 1.3 million impressions. There's a significant advantage in being a member. And right now, depending upon the firm, we're seeing an 8 to 14 times increase in lead flow for members if they're sorting to the top of these pages. Where they're getting the most dramatic increase in lead flow is on the agent bio pages. Home buyers will tend to go a couple of pages deep looking for the right home, but home buyers or home sellers are not willing to go past page one or two of agents that they might hire. That's where we see the highest advantage in winning selling listings and winning buyer agency on our site. The good news is it's working.
John Campbell: Very helpful. Thanks Andy.
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our last question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill down further on the resi monetization, the commentary around $200 million annual recurring bookings continuing at this pace. I was just wondering, as we think about like the agent within that bookings, how are you thinking -- you talked about a wide range there from $100, $200 per month to as much as $7,400. Are there certain kinds of agents that you're targeting? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So we are -- there's 1.6 million agents. I think we're initially targeting 540,000 agents. I think we set a floor -- I won't get the exact number, but I think $30,000, $40,000 annual earnings is what we -- or higher. So it's a pretty broad swath. Price points are from $100, $200 at the lower end, up to tens of thousands of dollars to $100,000 a month for one of these bigger teams with lots of agents on them. I've spent the last week monitoring sales calls, listening to the sort of reaction and the dialogue of the discussion. One of the things I'm very pleased with is that, I would say, overall, though the price points are different, the prospects and buyers have been pretty resonant with what we're doing. So I think we've dialed it in correctly and we'll be refining the strategy as we go through the year. Scott, would you add anything on that?
Scott Wheeler: That's the initial population, of course, that we came out with the targets. And what we're seeing is that the inbound lead flow is very strong from all agents. So our sales force is going after their top prospects in the target list, but also responding to all the leads that are coming in as quickly as possible. And then on top of that, we have our e-commerce channel, which agents can go in and sign up with a few clicks and have all their information and they're ready to go. So all of those are performing well, and we'll continue to expand the group we target. But right out of the gate, we've got a lot to cover quickly.
Andrew Florance: 10 more memberships, another 50,000.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for the color.
Operator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Andy for closing remarks.
Andrew Florance: Thank you. Appreciate that. So today, I've got more interested in concluding remarks that I normally have. So I have some news to share with you. Scott Wheeler joined us as our CFO 8 years ago or so. During those 8 years, he's done a fantastic job at the helm of our finance department. We've seen our revenues triple in that time period, and we've gone from strength to strength. I would count Scott more than just a valued colleague. He's become a good friend of mine. As you may know, Scott loves to climb mountains. He was the first father daughter team to summit the tallest mountain in every U.S. state. It wasn't much of an accomplishment in Florida. It was a much bigger accomplishment in Alaska. Scott has accomplished as much as anyone could wish to professionally. So now he's earned the opportunity to retire and pursue his climbing passion in the golden years ahead.
Scott Wheeler: Golden? That was off.
Andrew Florance: Scott will remain with the company until June to facilitate a transition, and I will bring back the other two former CFOs to help in the transition as well. Scott is our third public company CFO with each of our prior CFOs also having served exactly 8-year tenure. We'll begin a search for our 2024 to 2032 CFO immediately. I would have let Scott announce his own retirement, but the last CFO to retire became for Clint when he announced his retirement so I wanted to avoid that awkwardness today. Scott leaves with no disagreements or issue, he simply wants to enjoy the fruits of his labor Godspeed, Scott, and thank you so much. I would like to thank everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2023 earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter call on April 2023, 2024. Thank you very much for participating. Thank you, Mr. Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I'll cry after the call.
Andrew Florance: You need a tissue, man?
Scott Wheeler: That was kind of you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Andy Florance : Thank you, Cyndi. It reminds me of summer camp, gather around the campfire kids. Cyndi is going to read the safe harbor statement again. All right. Let's be serious. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $606 million or 13% growth year-over-year. Revenue growth in our Commercial Information and Marketplace business was an impressive 15% year-over-year. We continue to deliver strong double-digit revenue growth which, in this case, is particularly impressive during one of the most difficult property markets in decades.  I'm pleased to see our portfolio is strong across the board with Apartments.com, CoStar, LoopNet, Real Estate Manager, STR, Lands.com and businesses for sale all delivering double-digit revenue growth. We continue to deliver outstanding sales results with $82 million of net new bookings in the second quarter, our second highest sales quarter ever.  I believe we crossed a monumental milestone in June when our residential portal network continued its phenomenal growth and became the second most heavily trafficked residential marketplace in the U.S. Overall, traffic to CoStar Group's websites reached a high of 105 million monthly unique visitors in June, according to Google Analytics. Earlier this year, we moved into third place when we surpassed Redfin's first quarter self-reported home and estimated rental site traffic. Then in the second quarter, we moved up again the second place, as we had 84 million average monthly unique visitors to our residential portal network, surpassing realtor.com self-reported traffic of 72 million monthly unique visitors from their earnings release on May 11, 2023. CoStar Group's residential network combines residential rental site and homes traffic for sales site traffic, as others do. Homes.com is the fastest-growing residential portal with network traffic growing 130% year-over-year in June to 38 million monthly unique visitors. That's an accomplishment one year after we launched Homes.com or within the first year, won't be launching Homes.com. Congrats, Jerry, Livie and the whole team and Todd. Apartments.com once again delivered an outstanding quarter. Apartments.com revenue was $224 million in the second quarter, accelerating to 23% year-over-year growth. The Apartments.com sales team delivered a record net new sales quarter with net sales bookings increasing 84% compared to the same quarter last year.  The month of June was our highest sales month ever. We continue to add new customers to our marketplace at a rapid pace and now have over 66,000 paying communities on our network, representing an increase of 12% over the second quarter of last year. Our mid-market efforts are contributing thousands of new properties, growing paid subscribers by almost 40% in the second quarter.  New construction is also contributing to subscriber growth. 65% of all new 100-plus unit communities are advertising with Apartments.com. And of those advertising, 80% are at the platinum level or higher. Our sales team continues to deliver exceptional results and high productivity. Our sales productivity is up 24% over the second quarter of last year. The number of quality meetings with customers increased by 13% to 155,000 compared to the first quarter.  Our Net Promoter Score rose to a very impressive 95%, the highest since the quarter -- first quarter -- I'm sorry, that's the highest since the third quarter of 2020, and a really impressive number.  I'm proud to say our team delivered strong performance of the National Apartment Association Annual Conference in Atlanta last month. They were motivated by a surprise appearance by an always entertaining Jeff Goldblum. Our team delivered almost double the sales level of last year's conference. I'd like to extend a special thanks to Paige Forrest, Fred Saint and the whole sales team at Apartments.com for in continuing to produce exceptional results quarter after quarter, month after month. In June, monthly unique visitors for Apartments.com grew 9% year-over-year significantly outperforming the market, which is down approximately 9% year-over-year according to Google. Our 2023 Apartments.com marketing campaign is in full swing. We are reaching renters across all media channels during peak rental season and generating over 2.8 billion media impressions, up 11% over last year.  Since the launch of this year's campaign, we're already seeing phenomenal results with unaided awareness for Apartments.com reaching a very impressive 49%. That's the highest level ever. Our data indicates that this level of unaided awareness has never been achieved by anyone in the online rental marketplace category. Economic conditions in the apartment industry continue to create a favorable advertising environment. Apartment vacancy rates on three, four and five-star properties continue to rise increasing 220 basis points over prior year to 7.9%. Unit-level deliveries are at all-time highs, and supply will continue to outweigh demand for the foreseeable future. We expect vacancy rates to continue to increase for the next four quarters, peaking at around 9% in mid-2024. With favorable advertising conditions, a strong and growing sales force and industry-leading products, we expect to see Apartments.com revenue growth accelerate to 25% through the end of this year. Over at Homes.com, we continue to make great progress in implementing our strategy. Traffic to our homes network reached a new high of 38 million unique visitors in June according to Google Analytics, growing 130% and over the same period last year. Sequentially, our Homes.com average monthly unique visitors grew 75%, as we continue to grow traffic share towards our next milestone of 50 million unique visitors. With returning users up 416% in June versus a year ago, I believe consumers are appreciating Homes.com's outstanding UX and the ability to contact the listing agents directly and clearly, the ones who know more about the property than some other unrelated agent. According to comScore, Homes.com unique visitors are up 224% in the second quarter over the same quarter last year, while Zillow's traffic is down 5%, realtor.com is down 13% and Redfin is up 4%.  I'm pleased with our success growing site traffic on Homes.com to date, and I believe we have a lot of runway ahead as we continue to implement our content, product and marketing plans. This is a marathon and not a sprint. We are clear that we have more and bigger traffic levers to pull to grow traffic over the quarters to come.  Our future growth in traffic will come in waves. Any period where traffic lulls, it may just be the trough before a monster wave comes. I'm very confident that 18 months from now, we will have very impressive rankings. Alongside our increase in consumer traffic, we continue to focus on agent engagement. We've built an incredible committee of 1.1 million real estate agents on Homesnap Pro with hundreds of thousands of active users each month. We have integrated the top feature set of our Homesnap Pro product into the Homes.com platform and have begun migrating agents over to Homes Pro, our new agent-facing set of tools.  Our new Homes Pro product will provide significant benefit to our current Homesnap users, including access to 15 times the consumer traffic, millions of free leads and additional tools and feature upgrades. With these tools fully integrated, agents for the first time will be able to experience the full value of professional tools integrated with a heavily trafficked, agent-friendly your listing, your lead business model. In June, we launched our first installment of proprietary content on Homes.com with massive volumes of immersive neighborhood videos, informative write-ups and photographs. We also released a comprehensive set of school profiles, information ratings, all giving us what I believe to be the most complete coverage of schools on any residential property website. We are still in the very early stages of our content strategy, but I'm encouraged by the consumer response to what we've built so far. We recently conducted another round of focus groups in various cities with both consumers and agents and tested our product features and content. I have attended hundreds of focus groups in dozens of cities over the past three decades. The consumer and agent response we received them these most recent focus groups is the best I've ever seen, really encouraging responses. I believe we're on the right track.  We have much more work ahead to build out the full new Homes.com product offering, but I believe that based upon the focus groups, there will be a very positive consumer response to what we deliver. CoStar revenue for the second quarter was $229 million, an 11% increase over the same period last year. That's coming in above our 10% revenue guidance. We're seeing higher levels of sales to new logo accounts, and I'm encouraged by the strong sales results to owners, lenders and corporate users, which grew 134% over the first quarter of this year.  Clearly, our efforts to shift our sales team to focus on owner, lender and tenant prospects is paying off. Sales activities to these customer types were approximately 20% higher in the second quarter than the first quarter of this year, and are expected to increase further in the second half of the year. Another positive sign for CoStar was our 92% renewal rate in the quarter, which increased from the 91% renewal rate in the first quarter.  Our CoStar Lender product had its best sales quarter ever, with net new sales nearly doubled the sales results from the first quarter of this year. We've had success selling to financial institutions of all shapes and sizes with a product that's proving far superior to competitive offerings. Our ability to match individual properties to loan portfolios alongside our credit default model are valuable differentiators of CoStar Lender that others simply cannot match.  Our clients continue to refer to our solution as the best-in-class and the gold standard. We're still in the early stages of this $300 million market opportunity with 200 customers signed and 5,800 more potential customers ahead. In April, we released property investment fund data into CoStar. The release includes 12,600 investment funds, which we have linked to 70,000 commercial properties in the CoStar database. This new information adds to CoStar's unique data sets, providing the ability to search for funds based on their property portfolio characteristics, transactions and listings.  In the two months since we introduced the product, we have closed over 100 CoStar sales where the fund data was a critical part of the value proposition. In May, we released our new tenant application, which includes enhancements to our existing tenant location information as well as a new corporate user feature. The new corporate user feature aggregates all locations for the 32,000 largest corporations that occupy five or more locations. This product allows users to run a query on a large corporate occupier for example, Walmart, and see all of their locations, the types of buildings they occupy, building details, financial information on the company and credit risk. Brokers find this information very valuable as they quickly understand how large tenants utilize space across their portfolios and identify opportunities to serve those companies.  I believe the strong pace of new product introductions, alongside the sales team's focus on owners, lenders and corporate users will continue to support strong revenue growth even as we navigate one of the worst points of the current CRE cycle. LoopNet revenue was $66 million for the quarter, up 16% year-over-year and in-line with revenue growth of 16% in the first quarter. LoopNet continues to be the most highly trafficked commercial real estate marketplace, capturing 14 million average monthly unique visitors for the second consecutive quarter, up 13% year-over-year. According to SEM Rush data for the month of June, LoopNet and LoopNet Canada have seven and eight times the traffic of our nearest competitors, respectively. Unique visitors to the Canadian network are up 51% year-over-year. While the LoopNet marketplace remains strong and competitively advantaged, LoopNet's sales growth should have been stronger in the second quarter. We believe the lower sales resulted from a combination of factors and that most of these factors are correctable. These factors include a growing and relatively young sales team a training program, which has room for improvement, a large number of account transitions and a poorly conceived commission plan that drove lower activity levels and a weak customer service, which reduced our renewal rates.  Does that sound like a CEO that's not happy with something? That's true. Countering that, the climbing commercial real estate vacancy rates did create positive countercyclical demand for leasing solutions similar to the positive results environment we're seeing in Apartments.com. In fact, I was on the phone this morning with Mike, who is one of our more experienced LoopNet sales reps, and he said he's witnessing unprecedented demand for advertising for LoopNet in this severe downturn. He says that office owners who in the past or industrial owners who never considered advertising before in the internet are now all in trying to drive leads to their troubled leasing assets. We will increase service levels while reinforcing customer retention is a priority in a revised incentive compensation plan. Despite the near-term disruption, I remain very confident in the long-term LoopNet growth opportunity in our direct sales team and strategy. Our LoopNet network of international marketplaces delivered strong growth in the second quarter with revenue increasing 35% year-over-year and net new sales up 24%. Our international expansion efforts will continue in the second half of the year as we plan on launching LoopNet in France and Spain, which will run alongside of our Bureau Loco, Business MO and Belbex marketplaces. STR revenue was 11% compared to the second quarter of last year, with subscription revenue growing an impressive 14%. For the second quarter in a row, STR achieved record sales results with more and more subscriptions.  When we purchased STR in 2019, approximately 60% of STR revenue was subscription-based and 40% was one-off transactional. The STR team has done a great job of transitioning the business to 80% subscription revenue currently. Renewal rates on STR subscriptions are at an amazing 97%. In May, we successfully launched our STR benchmarking product in CoStar and the initial results are encouraging. Our teams have migrated over 60 customers to the benchmarking product in CoStar with another 250 customer migrations in progress. The transition is anticipated to be completed in approximately one year, encompassing over 900 corporate accounts and 6,000 independent hotels. The release of the new benchmarking product represents a digital transformation of the beloved and 38-year-old industry standard Star report.  The feedback from clients on this integration and enhancement is astounding. One customer referred to it as an epical change. I don't think I refer to anything as epical changes. But owners and operators are thrilled with the new advanced analytics options, data visualizations, abundance of historical data and of course, the trusted STR report.  We anticipate this release will open access to new clients as the data is invaluable for asset acquisition, operations and disposition. I'm looking forward to completing the migration to CoStar, which will accelerate our growth into what we see as a $300 million market opportunity. CoStar Real Estate Manager signed a number of the world's largest companies to our lease administration and transaction management solutions in the second quarter. Most of these names are confidential, but you'd recognize, for example, the company behind the word processing software that I wrote this on.  Year-over-year subscription revenue grew 14% in the second quarter. Subscription revenue climbed at 92% of revenue in the first half of '23 versus 87% in 2021. We enjoyed a 100% customer renewal rate in the second quarter. Today, 7 out of 10 of the largest U.S. banks are using Real Estate Manager lease accounting, lease administration or transaction management solutions.  BizBuySell continues to experience double-digit growth and is expected to exceed $30 million in revenue in 2023, an important milestone. Quarterly traffic to the BizBuySell network reached an all-time high of 12.6 million sessions in Q2, which is 25% growth year-over-year and lead volume to advertisers was up 30% during the same quarter. BizBuySell is the leading marketplace in the business for sale category. Our land business is on track to increase revenue by double digits and to exceed a major milestone of $50 million in revenue. When we acquired Land in Farm and LandsofAmerica, those businesses had $4 million of revenue. So $50 million is an important growth milestone. Implementing our and our playbook, we added LandWatch, combined sites into Land.com network greatly increased traffic exposure for clients and recently added gold and platinum ads. Our investment in product and people continues later this year with the launch of diamond ads and adding sales headcount, which increased 26% year-over-year, and our target is to increase at 50% year-over-year. Ten-X continues to perform well, while overall CRE market conditions remain challenging. Q1 '23 CRE transactions, commercial real estate transactions, were down 51% year-over-year, and Q2 further declined to 63% year-over-year down. That is the steepest decline since the Great Recession where transaction volumes had declined 66% year-over-year.  Bid-ask spreads continue to grow wider due to higher interest rates and constricted debt loan-to-value ratios, and all that's caused upward pressure in cap rates. The overall CMBS delinquency rate rose to 3.9% in June, the highest rate in 14 months and it's expected to grow in 2023 and 2024. We appear to be seeing a very severe significant pretend and extend phase from lenders and distressed assets are coming but it's just a question of when, not if.  Ten-X applied its proven principles of syncing value expectations with our seller broker customers to onboard assets with reserve pricing set to current market conditions. For Q2, Ten-X onboarded $1.5 billion of inventory, a 27% increase year-over-year and two times '23 volume. And we delivered a solid 52% trade rate, and that compares favorably to the offline world's 23% trade rate.  Due to the ongoing bid-ask misalignment, Ten-X over $2.9 billion of potential inventory that was deemed high risk for transaction success because the seller had an unrealistically high opinion of value. So we didn't take those properties on in order to avoid wasting money on underwriting them and lowering our trade rates.  We continue to build and improve our platform for the future. The Ten-X sales force grew 36% year-over-year and delivered higher quality high-valued assets in Q2. The average asset value was up 33% year-over-year from $3.5 million to $4.6 million. The average winning bid was up 11% year-over-year from $3.2 million to $3.7 million and the average buyer premium was up 27% year-over-year from 72,000 to 92,000. There was a 53% year-over-year inventory growth in the $1 million to $10 million range which is what we consider Ten-X a sweet spot.  We've made significant progress with our technology with the Ten-X platform, now fully integrated in the CoStar ecosystem. Customers can now fully manage their transactions digitally through the marketing auction contracting and closing phases of a sale. Sellers and brokers can now manage their listings and leads in marketing center and buyers can interact with their brokers and sellers via the Ten-X LoopNet and CoStar sites. Finally, to lift everybody up, I would -- I thought I would talk a little bit about the commercial real estate economy, really sort of pick things up. Did you know [Indiscernible] means to lift up, yeah. So the capital markets continue to see the impact of rising interest rates. As I mentioned, second quarter sales transaction volumes were down 63% compared to the same quarter and was down across all property types in the commercial real estate markets. Prices are also falling, but the lack of real deal activity makes price transparency difficult.  The debt market has not yet seen a wave of distress with delinquencies still very low by historical standards, but there has been some movement. The next couple of years will bring more clarity to that market as more than $1 trillion in CMBS debt comes due. The office sector continued to weaken in the second quarter and can now be characterized as the worst it's ever been. Vacancies now sit at 13 -- what a horrible thing to have to say. Vacancy rates now sit at 13.1%, their highest levels ever. However, office space that's no longer occupied by a tenant or is underutilized by tenant is not truly stably leased. Most lenders are not considering space leased that -- considering space leased but not occupied to be leased, there's got to be a tenant actually in this space before lenders consider at least.  Based on that fact, the phantom or true effective vacancy rate is closer to 57% if you assume a 50% tenant occupancy of lease space. That is, by far, the worst vacancy rate in the history of the office industry. Tenants gave back 40 million square feet in the first half of 2023 with another $100 million forecast to be given back to the remainder of the year. Net absorption was negative again in the second quarter and now totals more than 150 million square feet negative since the pandemic began. Negative absorption was a third of that level in the '28 financial crisis at negative 50 million square feet. So this is much worse than the '08 situation.  Conditions will likely not improve anytime soon. We expect vacancy rates continue to arise. Overall sales prices for office buildings are down 5.9% and delinquency rates while still low, have tripled since the end of last year to 4.4% currently. I believe the downward price pressure is much higher than a 5.9% decline and that the quality of office loan collateral is weaker than many presented to be. The hotel sector continues its recent trend of slow growth in the second quarter. Room rates rose at around the level of inflation, having limited potential for improved profitability. Resort destination show signs of slowing growth as consumer spending cooled, while hotels and urban markets report improved growth supported by corporate group demand and transient travelers. Higher interest rates have put a damper on construction and deal activity.  The industrial and retail sectors continue to be relatively healthy at 4.7% industrial vacancy rate is historically low and annual growth for rent remains very strong. Retail vacancy reached another all-time low with continued positive absorption. Announced store openings continue to exceed store closures. So that's good news. The residential sector continues to face challenges with a 30-year mortgage rates around 7%, monthly prices on the rise in the last three months, and affordability is reaching a low not seen since 1986. And creates challenging condition.  Total home sales fell 16% year-over-year with more than 60% of the existing mortgage rates below 4% and more than 80% below 5% and rate lock will keep inventory of existing homes low. People are not going to be trading out of those low interest rates. Builders have responded though as single-family housing starts moved higher earlier this year new homes account for 15% of all sales compared to only 10% a few years ago. Builders are offering incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and price discounts to attract buyers. Still, affordability remains a challenge.  So despite that difficult real estate market, CoStar delivered yet another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth, our second highest sales quarter ever. We exceeded 100 million monthly unique visitors for the first time in June, which was an incredible milestone and demonstrates our ability to deliver successful leading property marketplaces across multiple sectors and across multiple countries. Our marketplace networks continue to grow and provide value to our advertising customers as time when vacancies are on the rise. Although the composition of our revenue growth continues to shift with the market dynamics, I'm very confident in our ability to deliver our financial projections for 2023. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to young Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler : Thank you, old CEO, Andy.
Andy Florance : Now, now.
Scott Wheeler : I appreciate that introduction. I believe I'm one digit younger than you still for another month or two.  Great quarter financially, a lot to cover. So let me jump right into the revenue by our service areas. So CoStar revenue grew 11%, as Andy mentioned, slightly above our guidance at 10% with the strength in our net new sales exceeding our forecast. So we saw a stronger new customer sales in the quarter, particularly to owners, investors and lenders. And even our broker sales stabilized in the second quarter, we signed almost 800 new broker agreements this quarter. Vast majority of them are in the one to two broker size category. So that's definitely an improved trend from the last couple of quarters.  We expect CoStar revenue growth to be 10% in the third quarter, and now between 10% to 11% for the full year, a modest increase from our previous outlook. Apartments.com's second quarter revenue growth of 23% was in line with our expectations. We had another record sales level for Paige and the team. The new property volumes increased 12% year-over-year and volumes in the mid-market category growing much more rapidly at 40% growth year-over-year.  We are seeing more and more customers now upgrading to the higher tier ads, particularly the 100 unit and above-unit properties are doing that quite a bit more now. Our net add level upgrades are now at or above the levels that we're operating at before the 2021 disruption in the apartments market. We expect that trend to continue.  With continued strong sales results, we now expect third and fourth quarter revenue growth of 25% for Apartments.com which is up from the 24% assumed in our last outlook. So our full year revenue growth outlook is slightly up in the range of 23% to 24% for apartments. LoopNet revenue grew 16% in the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter of the year, slightly below our guidance of 18%, which is a shortfall of about $1 million. As Andy mentioned, LoopNet sales in the second quarter fell short of our expectations, and we are adjusting our full year revenue outlook for LoopNet to approximately 15% year-over-year revenue growth. LoopNet's third quarter revenue growth is expected to be around 14%. Revenue from Information Services grew 9% in the second quarter. STR and Real Estate Manager continued to post strong double-digit revenue growth, particularly in their subscription parts of the business, which we expect to continue through the end of the year. It's really impressive to look at the renewal rates and STR at 97% and Real Estate Manager 100%. Those are very critical products for our customers.  We're starting to see more and more of our banking customers move to our new CoStar lender product which shifts a small amount of information services revenue up to the CoStar category. Accordingly, we expect revenue growth in the upper single digits for the third quarter and approximately 9% for the full year in Information Services.  Our residential revenue came in at $13 million, in line with our expectations. We expect third quarter revenue of around $11 million, in line with our last forecast and full year 2022 fee revenue of $45 million. Other Marketplaces revenue was $32 million in the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter revenue and effectively flat to prior year. Ten-X revenue was lower than expected in the second quarter as the low transaction volumes and deal uncertainty weighed on the results. Ten-X aside, our lands and businesses for sale marketplaces revenue were up 11% year-over-year in the second quarter.  For the second half of the year, we're moderating our revenue outlook for Ten-X and assuming a continued low transaction level environment. If for some reason, it improves in the later part of the year, we'll take the upside. We now expect full year revenue for other marketplaces in a range of $130 million to $135 million for the full year, a reduction of approximately $20 million from our prior outlook. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $127 million, above the high end of our second quarter guidance range of $123 million. Favorable performance relates primarily to the timing of our investment spend. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21%, 1 percentage point above guidance. Our sales force totaled approximately 1,160 people in June 30, an increase of 17% from June of last year and approximately 40 sellers from the end of the first quarter. The majority of the increase in the second quarter is in our Marketplace business. Our contract renewal rate was 90% for the second quarter of 2023 with the renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer at 94%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 81% for the second quarter compared to 80% in the second quarter of 2022.  We have a rock-solid balance sheet with $5.2 billion in cash. We now earn around 4.8% interest on our cash versus paying 2.8% interest on our debt. Positive net interest income was $52 million in the second quarter. 2023 outlook. Our full year outlook is now in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.46 billion for revenue, reflecting our adjusted transaction revenue forecast for Ten-X in the second half of the year. Our subscription-based businesses are expected to continue to deliver strong sales and double-digit revenue growth in the second half, and we expect full year revenue growth of 13% at the midpoint of the range for the year. The company expects revenue for the third quarter of 2023 in the range of $622 million to $627 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range.  We're reconfirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. Our revised adjusted EBITDA guidance range is $510 million to $520 million. For the third quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $115 million to $120 million. Well, that does it for me in the financial facts. Let's go back over to our operator, and we can begin the quarterly ritual of question and answers. Back to you, operator.
Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
George Tong : Your residential network grew significantly in the quarter and is now the second largest in the U.S. Can you discuss how the strong performance in resi traffic influences your residential spending intentions in the second half of the year and heading into 2024?
Andy Florance : Sure. Thank you for pointing out, George, that our residential platform is now the second most heavily traffic platform in the United States. I appreciate that.  So I think we have a pretty clear plan or strategy for how we plan to continue to grow that traffic and the value of that platform to consumers. I don't think that the success we're having to date is going to take us off of that plan. So we're largely on track with what we've been intending. We want to continue to grow the traffic even more dramatically in order to make sure that we have the best platform for monetizing at the point that we decided to do that.
George Tong : Got it. Thank you. 
Andy Florance : Thank you, George. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is now open. 
Heather Balsky : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about LoopNet and the execution challenges, and I hope that wording fits for the business and kind of what you're looking to do to improve the trajectory? And how quickly you think you can reaccelerate the business and see the results from the investments you've made in the sales force? Thanks. 
Andy Florance : Sure. I thought you were going to ask about our residential portal being number two and moving quickly from number four or five to number two. But I'll take the question you asked. So I'm sorry.  So I was thinking that we would begin to turn around the execution performance on LoopNet on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday. And so if you look at Apartments.com, I think a little about a year or so ago, it was growing at 6% year-over-year. Now it's moving towards 24%, 25% year-over-year growth. So these things are -- when they emerge, they're pretty straightforward to troubleshoot and to put them on track. I don't believe this is an issue of demand, I believe this is a simple, relatively simple problem to solve. We actually have a decent sized sales force now, but I think we're just incentivizing the wrong activities and I think we can move it back on track. Now keep in mind, big picture, it wasn't that long ago that we acquired LoopNet, and the revenue was less than our lands business, and now I think it's about $0.25 billion or something. So it's doing quite well. 16% growth is not bad, but I just think it can do better. And it will do better. So nearly immediately.
Heather Balsky : That's helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. Your line is now open. 
Peter Christiansen : Good evening. Thanks for the question. I'm not sure if I heard that right. You guys are number two in that ---
Andy Florance : That's right. It's shocking that we have moved up that quickly to become an uncommon of a player. But yeah, that's actually right, Pete.
Peter Christiansen : Okay. All right. I just wasn't sure. I want to dig a little bit more into LoopNet, like what you're seeing on both the broker ads and the signature ads and whether or not you feel the value proposition for some of the signature ads is really compelling enough. I was just wondering if you can draw that distinction, help us understand the differences between the two price levels and how you see that hopefully improving in the near future?
Andy Florance : Yeah. So again, it's not that it is terrible. 16% year-over-year growth is pretty strong, obviously, in a bad CRE market, which actually should be helping it more. I think it's really -- I remain convinced that it's a no-brainer. When I talked to our experienced successful sales reps, the demand is clear.  Their selling contracts that are reaching new high points for those premier signature ads. And if you think about it, if you think about somebody who owns a $1 billion building that has a major leasing risk and has as part of the massive loans coming due in the next couple of years, spending a couple of thousand dollars a month in order to try to raise your profile when the vast majority of tenants are looking for their commercial real estate on LoopNet and CoStar, it's a no-brainer.  So I feel very comfortable with that value proposition. But it's just a question of continuing to improve the -- trying to go from 16% to 18% to 20%, still being satisfied with something in the lower teens.
Scott Wheeler : And Pete, when we look at the growth in the signature ads, the biggest growing category in signature ads is the diamond listings. And those are the biggest, most expensive ones. They're up over 50% year-over-year by ad count. So that tells us that the demand is clearly there. The large owners and property managers really need those higher-performing ads. And so it's just a matter of getting our sales force back on track to cover the market more effectively.
Andy Florance : And Pete, I toured a building the other day that was distressed, brand-new building, beautiful building, the owner stood to stand, they couldn't lease it. They stood to stand, they were going to lose perhaps $80 million. The building was completely vacant and the brokers had not marketed on LoopNet. And it just blows your mind that someone, an owner would potentially lose $80 million for a leasing problem. Vast majority of tenants look for space on LoopNet and the brokers save themselves a couple of hundred bucks.  So I think it's a pretty solid value proposition. It should be coming into -- it should be doing better than ever, similar to Apartments.com.
Peter Christiansen : Good commentary. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tomasello from KBW. Your line is now open. 
Ryan Tomasello : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Andy, just reading between the lines and some of your comments around homes, I mean, obviously, the traffic growth continues to come in very strong. I mean should we now be expecting perhaps a bit longer of a time line in terms of when you intend to monetize that platform relative to, I think, the year-end commentary you've given in the past?  And on the traffic levels, understanding there's some competitive sensitivity there, but any color you can provide around when we can expect these waves of growth to materialize? And then finally, on the content piece, what any one do you say you're in, in that build out there? Thanks. 
Andy Florance : Okay. So I would say from the monetization perspective, we anticipate we anticipate significant progress in our efforts in traffic in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter 2024, second quarter 2020 clear significant additional progress. We are -- the rationale for monetizing in the fourth quarter, even though we may be hitting very close to the $50 million monetization level would be to demonstrate proof of monetization ability to you -- the investor representative. But strategically, it might be much wiser to begin to monetize when you expect a second stair step function of growth in 2024 first, second Q. So always try to do the right thing for the investors in the intermediate time period, not the short time period. And maybe one day, we'll do the right thing for investors in the long time period, but the intermediate time period is pretty important.  And then where -- what inning are we in on the content, I would say we are in the second inning on content. There's a lot -- I mean, and I will tell you, I'm really pleased with some of the work that's happening, there are things we could do better but the volume of what we're doing is enormous. And I think that what we'll be able to do in the next year or so with that content will be I think, really quite impressive, and I think will be a really compelling value proposition for our platform. Did I forget one of the questions?
Scott Wheeler : Pretty good. I think you got a lot in there. 
Andy Florance : Yeah. So you're right, trying not to disclose strategic things. Anyone else. Are there any other questions? 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now open. 
Jeff Meuler : Yeah, thank you. I want to ask about Homes.com traffic quality. You gave us a metric on return users. I'm assuming that's including on a re-advertised basis where they're clicking back through on another ad. Can you just give us any other Homes.com traffic quality metrics including things like return rates or time spent on site, et cetera, thus far in the markets where you've loaded the proprietary content up in June? Thank you. 
Andy Florance : For sure. So I won't have -- I will not have significant digit data for you in front of me, but I will tell you that one of the most important things I look for is return traffic direct, so people that typed in Homes.com, and that is up about 400% year-over-year. So we are not -- I'm not focused on who's coming back in off of SCM. I'm focused on who is coming in direct return. And that number is up dramatically, so very happy with that. Secondarily, I'm looking at the lead flow and the lead flow is, I believe, very solid. I believe and I'm not going to disclose any specific numbers, but I believe that we are delivering twice the lead flow of some of the well-known residential platforms in the United States. And I think there is -- I think that's dramatic. I think that's important. And I think the reason why we're delivering twice the lead flow of some of our competitors is really quite simple. We are putting the name, photo, likeness, contact information of the actual listing agent on the listing, so people can reach out and simply contact the person that knows the listing better than anyone else in the world. Competing sites are setting that lead into a call center and often syndicating the lead out to multiple unrelated agents that don't know that listing at all. So consumers are reasonably smart sometimes, and I think they're on to that and we're getting super high-quality traffic to the site and good lead flow. Now remember also, we have a huge engaged group of residential agents who are in our platforms, and they like our message. They like the fact that we are, your listing, your lead. So they're directing a lot of their clients, I believe, into our platform because they prefer what we're doing to alternatives. And again, that's super high quality.  So I'm very happy with the quality, and I would just like to double the overall traffic at some point soon.
Jeff Meuler : And what impact are you seeing in the markets where you've loaded the proprietary content thus far, in contrast with those were you having yet?
Andy Florance : The content is being loaded on a partial level in all markets. So it's not it's not LA being loaded in Boston not being loaded. It's like x percent of Boston, x percent of LA being loaded. I would tell you that at this point, you haven't -- I don't think there's been time enough to see any traffic impact of the content that's been loaded. I think that's out in the future.  And in terms of reaction, it have to go more to the anecdotal just that's like having focus groups interviewing consumers and that is very positive. That's very, very positive. I couldn't be happier with that result.
Jeff Meuler : Okay. Thanks, Andy. 
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. 
Alexei Gogolev : Hi, everyone. Andy, great to hear from you. Could I ask you to update us on your vision for the core CoStar products? I remember you talking a lot about penetration of brokerages with more than five brokers. How is that progressing? And could you maybe weigh out some other prospects that you see among owners, lenders and corporation.
Andy Florance : Okay. So I was testing my hearing there a little bit. But -- so one of the most -- and one of the most encouraging and exciting things about what's happening in CoStar is the pace of delivery. So as you listen to what we're doing, where we're bringing the corporate user aggregation data, we're doing the fund data, we're doing CoStar Lender.  We're doing -- we're bringing in a stream of functionalities. So Elizabeth Winkle, is doing a good job with her brand development team picking up the pace setting every time she adds in the STR integration. Every time we add another modular element to the product we appeal to a broader audience, where we have more relevance to a particular audience we're trying to penetrate more deeply.  So I like this new era of CoStar where we're bringing modules out faster and faster and faster, and that will also include adding more international markets to the coverage area. And as we do that, we create more demand. I believe that our CoStar sales team has done a good job responding and shifting to selling to lenders, owners and corporate users. You see that number going way up. So I think that while Paige Forrest and her team at Apartments.com is knocking on the first milestone of $1 billion, I think Marc Swartz and the CoStar sales team won't be that far behind them. And I think the fact that we are in clearly hands down the toughest commercial real estate market ever, and we're showing the kind of growth we're showing is really a testament to the product quality, the value, the research team and the sales work. So it's not an optimal office market. So we're doing pretty darn well.
Alexei Gogolev : Thank you, Andy. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Your line is now open. 
Stephanie Moore : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. 
Andy Florance : Good afternoon. 
Stephanie Moore : Just touching on the residential side and again, congrats on the great achievements thus far, particularly related to the traffic on the sites themselves. But I kind of wanted to touch on maybe the level of investment spend expectations as we look out over the next 12 or 18 months? I'm just trying to kind of triangulate comments maybe related to your point on being in the second inning of content creation, plans to continue to spend on whether it's personnel? And then also the idea of kind of monetization more so a 1Q 2024 event. So just wanted to get your thoughts on where we are from an investment standpoint. Thanks. 
Andy Florance : Sure. Well, you're right. As you point out that we achieved rapidly ascended to the second most heavily trafficked sites in the United States. In terms of the content, adding personnel around the content and what we're doing with that, yes, when we produce the product, and we then test it and focus groups, and we test it with consumers and it's not a mockup. It's not PowerPoint, it's like real product, real data, real content and they clearly respond very positively to what we're doing. That leads us to feel very comfortable with the investment we're making in differentiating our product through a number of content strategies. So we would -- and to be clear, what we're doing is massive. One of the things you hear in focus groups is a, I love what they're doing. And then the next comment they say it is, are they really doing this for the whole United States of America? How are they doing that? But it's well worth it.  And if you look at CoStar as a product or STR, sometimes our original content is all the differentiation to create a moat around a product. And in an intermediate term, that investment is a relatively modest percentage of revenue but it always looks much bigger when you're in the early phases of making the investment. But if you're concerned about us bringing additional investment into the content area, the focus groups were bad news for you because they love what we're doing.  And then in terms of other investments, nothing has really changed. You can see -- you're not seeing any Jeff Goldblums out there for Homes.com at this point. There's no sort of broad consumer marketing occurring. But at some point, obviously, that is a lever you pull. It's an important lever to pull because it impacts SEO and SEM. It makes your SEO more effective, and it also makes you much more competitive in SEM. So the more likely people are to recognize the brand. The more likely they are to click on the SEM and Google serves it up more frequently at a lower cost to us, and you get a good effect there. But our unaided awareness on Apartments.com right now is 49%. The margin and profitability at Apartments.com is phenomenal. The unaided awareness, I got the first read from our unaided awareness is testing group on Homes.com and I'm not going to share it with you because it's so embarrassing. But one day and a couple of years from now, I hope to be reporting a number higher than 50% for Homes.com. So what right now we're doing is we're building a good loyal following of repeat users, but it's sort of all being earned one user experience at a time in the product.
Scott Wheeler : And from a financial perspective, we're still confirming our investment levels for the year as we had announced from -- I think in February, we set them out. We haven't changed those financial levels for the year. So all on track there.
Stephanie Moore : Great. Thank you. 
Scott Wheeler : You're welcome. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. We will turn it back to Andy to wrap up. Thank you.
Andy Florance : Well, we really appreciate everyone joining us on the call. I hope you noticed that my script was about three minutes less than normal, so that's an improvement. But thank you very much for joining us for the second quarter 2023 earnings call. We look forward to speaking to you again in the third quarter call on October 24, 2023, at 5 p.m. on the same channel. Thank you very much for participating.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-25 17:00:00) =====

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance. 
Andy Florance: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $584 million, or 13% growth year-over-year coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. I'm very pleased with the growth of our commercial information and non-residential marketplace businesses, which delivered 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. I'm also very pleased with the progress we're making in building the new Homes.com, which I believe will become the best online residential marketplace in the world bar none. We started the year strong with net new sales of $80 million, our second highest sales quarter ever and a 17% increase over the first quarter of the prior year. Apartments.com achieved the highest net new sales quarter for the second quarter in a row. LoopNet achieved outstanding results in the quarter with a 100% increase in net new sales over the first quarter of last year. We hit a new high watermark in traffic to our marketplaces in March. Monthly unique visitors totaled $94 million for the month with Apartments.com, Homes.com, LoopNet Lands, BizBuySell, Belbex, BureauxLocaux business in all of our marketplaces contributing up to tens of millions of unique visitors. Apartments.com continued its impressive run with another outstanding quarter. Apartments.com revenue was $211 million in the first quarter, climbing to 20% year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of 2021. Net new sales bookings were at an all-time high breaking the record set just last quarter with an increase of 110% in over the first quarter of '22. Apartments.com while very successful has millions of apartments that do not yet advertise on the site. We are focused on continuing to grow our sales force to reach this huge potential untapped audience. Our attention to attracting the best talent and excellent on-boarding and training of new hires is paying good dividends. Our sales team productivity is up over 40% compared to last year for hires who have been with us less than a year. We are committed to excellent customer service and that's a big contributor to our success. The apartment sales team conducted close to 140000 quality meetings this quarter which is 24% higher than the same quarter last year. Of those 140,000 quality meetings over 50,000 were in person, a 45% increase over the first quarter of '22. This attention to servicing continues to be well received by our clients as evidenced by our industry-leading Net Promoter Score of 94. The number of properties advertising on our platform continues to expand and is now at a record 64000 properties. Our customers are selecting higher ad package levels to obtain more leads as evidenced by our average revenue per property increase of 14% over the prior year. The economic fundamentals of the apartment industry continue to move in our favor. The vacancy rate for three, four and five-star properties rose another 30 basis points to 7.7% in the first quarter and net deliveries continue to outpace net absorption in the quarter with twice the units delivered as absorbed. Deliveries in '23 are expected to be the highest in over 40 years and vacancy rates are forecast to increase for the remainder of the year. There are currently over one million units under construction, with approximately 750,000 of them being at the top end of the market. Pressure on these assets will be intense throughout 2023 as rent levels moderate. We expect vacancy rates to remain elevated by historical standards. All this could create a jet stream like tailwind for advertising demand. March marked the official role to the new 2023 Apartments.com marketing campaign with new TV commercials, streaming videos and streaming audio commercials. Jeff Goldblum, as Brad Bellflower was featured during March Madness and all month across top networks like CVS, BRAVO, TBS, TNT, and more. We launched a new social media campaign, our streaming audio and podcast campaigns have hit the airwaves and engagements are at an all-time high. We anticipate that our 2023 campaign will yield 12 billion media impressions. The early results of this campaign are strong with our first quarter unaided brand awareness for Apartments.com jumping to our highest score ever. Apartments.com continues to attract qualified renters to our platform with an average of over 43 million monthly unique visitors in the quarter according to Google Analytics. Apartments.com is also benefiting from the addition of Homes.com rental area to its network and the tremendous growth in traffic to Homes.com. Visitors to the homes rental area up 83% since the fourth quarter of 2022 and those visitors delivered approximately 200,000 leads to our paying of Apartments.com customers, that's up 124% from just last quarter. With more content than ever before on our network including unit level details and touring capabilities our lead quality continues to outperform our competitors. Our mobile sessions were an all-time high in the first quarter with 75% of Apartments.com user sessions conducted on a mobile device. Just five keywords now account for 33% of unbranded search activity on these devices. When the top 376 cities in the United States are examined, Apartments.com ranks number for all five of these terms 99% of the time. The combination of the kickoff of our 2023 marketing campaign, market conditions and our larger and more seasoned sales teams helped continue to drive strong results. In sum, I am very pleased to report that we expect Apartments.com to deliver 22% to 23% revenue growth in 2023. I'm very excited about the progress we've made on many Homes.com initiatives in the short period of time. Last year, we laid out the key milestones for Homes.com grow, monetize and scale. The grow phase, focused on increasing traffic engaging buyers and sellers on our platform. Our initial goal in the grow phase was to achieve 25 million unique visitors, while our goal in the scale phase was to reach 50 million unique visitors. Traffic to our Homes.com network grew dramatically. We reached 27 million unique visitors in March, according to Google Analytics. Months-to-date in April traffic to Homes.com grew 53% over the same period months-to-date. As of this morning for the partial months-to-date we have already seen 28 million unique visitors to Homes.com network. Unique visitors for our Homes.com network is 88% above March of last year and traffic to our Homes.com site is up 183%, compared to last year. We are now four times the traffic levels from when we purchased Homes.com almost two years ago. By comparison, two years after we purchased Apartments.com, we'd only double the traffic. As we continue to build Homes.com and combine single-family residential with rental content from Apartments.com, we can now aggregate our traffic across both property marketplaces. In total, monthly unique visitors in March for our Apartments.com and Homes.com network was $72 million, according to Google Analytics. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Realtor.com reported 66 million monthly unique visitors while Redfin reported 44 million average monthly unique visitors. According to comScore, Homes.com unique visitors were up 153% year-over-year in March Realtor.com's monthly unique visitors decreased by 20%. Zillow's unique visitors were down 5% and Redfin's traffic increased 5% compared to March of last year. Alongside our increase in consumer traffic engagement agent engagement continues to improve. We now have approximately 1.1 million agents registered in Homes.com network up 37% for the first quarter of 2022. Active users are those who visit the site monthly have increased 64% versus last year. I believe the engagement will continue to improve as we're providing millions of free leads to agents that could generate billions of commission dollars for them under our Your Listing Your Lead Business model. In the months ahead, we're intensely focused on product development, generating proprietary content and building consumer traffic. Our team is extremely talented and singularly focused on winning. I wish I could share more detail on some of the great success stories, but I cannot for competitive reasons. With the progress we've made to-date, I remain confident that we're on track to begin monetizing Homes.com advertising product in the later part of this year. LoopNet was 63 -- revenue was $63 million for the first quarter up 16% year-over-year and accelerating from 12% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our investment in building a direct sales force for LoopNet's paying off. Net new bookings are up 100% year-over-year, which is directly attributable to our larger and more effective sales teams. The productivity for sellers in the first year has increased in each of the last four quarters as new reps ramp and become more productive. Sales of new signature ads are up 27% year-over-year. LoopNet captured record traffic in the quarter with 14 million average monthly unique visitors to a network of marketplaces up 12% year-over-year. According to Semrush LoopNet has eight times the traffic of our nearest competitor in March. We're also seeing traffic gains in Canada as our unique visitors for LoopNet Canada in the first quarter are over five times the unique visitors of our nearest competitor there. These accomplishments and investments reinforce our position as the most popular place to find a space and give me confidence in our ability to achieve our target of 18% to 19% revenue growth in 2023. As we continue to focus on international expansion with our revenues they are expected to exceed $80 million in 2023. By revenue our international business now ranks number four behind Apartments.com, CoStar and LoopNet. We now have over 500 international employees including 200 researchers and 130 sales representatives. In Europe, we currently operate more than a dozen cities in five countries with aspirations to expand our CoStar and LoopNet products into most of these major markets. Currently, CoStar and LoopNet are only offered in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom. We believe there's a $30 billion European market for real estate information services and marketplaces, which is roughly the same size as our North American market. A key step to capturing a significant share of that market is building and selling CoStar and LoopNet on a pan-European basis. One of the core unique competencies of our research operations is our on-the-ground field research operations. Our goal over the next few years is to photograph map and document all of the commercial properties 10,000 square feet or larger roughly 1,000 square meters in 15 European countries and approximately 36 cities. We will divide each city into one kilometer grids and capture all the relevant building inventory in each area. We anticipate capturing information on more than 1.5 million properties with a combined value in the trillions of euros. We have done this before in the US, Canada and the UK, and in each instance these massive efforts have resulted in a profitable and very valuable information asset. CoStar revenue increased $225 million in the first quarter, up 13%. For each month of the quarter, we saw a record number of distinct users in CoStar and in March exceeded 140,000 distinct users. Usage of CoStar and product engagement continues to grow as evidenced by nearly 6.5 million log-ins in the first quarter, a 26% increase over the last year. During those user sessions, property searches exceeded $20 million each month and property detail views averaged 15 million a month. Whilst CoStar continues to be the premier product for real estate professionals -- brokers, significant opportunities exist for selling to new customers. We have a 75% plus penetration rate amongst brokerages with five or more brokers and continue to prospect smaller firms with an annual revenue potential of $96 million. In addition, our sales teams are focused on owners, lenders and corporations where we have a significant addressable market. We believe we have over 51,000 owner prospects, 10,000 lender prospects and almost 4,000 corporations or 50 or more locations for a total of $1.4 billion in potential revenue. For the first time this quarter, product demonstrations to these aforementioned prospects exceeded those to the broker customers and broker prospects. Overall, we're seeing slightly lower than -- slightly lower net new bookings for CoStar, but still expect double-digit revenue growth in 2023. We've releasing corporate information on 12,600 real estate investment funds and 70,000 commercial properties within those funds into CoStar. The sub-fund information helps clients understand who has capital available to invest in the commercial real estate and what sort of product types they want to invest in and where they want to invest. We continue to focus on our banking customers with our lender product. Last month marked the one-year anniversary of releasing our fully integrated solution for lenders in CoStar. Sales continued to be strong in Q1 ending our first year by breaking the 150 total client milestone. These clients spend many lender types including banks, life insurance companies, credit unions and private lenders while ranging in size from $50 million CRE portfolios to over $50 billion CRE portfolio, proving a large opportunity moving forward. Our sales pipeline for lender is strong and we expect to build on that pipeline as the solution for lenders is uniquely positioned for continued growth in this uncertain environment. The value proposition is unmatched. No other company can connect a lender's portfolio to our rich property level information and provide a fully integrated credit model that assesses refinance risks as well as stress test a portfolio for an economic downturn. We expect continued sales opportunities due to regulators calling for increased portfolio surveillance by CRE focused lenders for multiple reasons, including the concern over office properties, rising rates, refinancing risks and the threat of a potential economic downturn. I remain confident in our ability to grow CoStar revenue, given our mission-critical data ongoing product enhancements and the continued expansion and diversification, of our customer base. Although overall CRE transaction volume was down 51% year-over-year, Ten-X continues to outperform the market, with a solid 60% trade rate up 3 times that of the off-line market and up 51% in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also saw the average number of bidders per auction on the platform increased over 3.2 in the first quarter, compared to 2.6 in the fourth quarter of 2022. In Q1 2023, Ten-X saw the average asset value increased 18% over the last year from $3.3 million to $3.9 million, average winning bid price increased 29% compared to the prior year from $3.1 million up to $4 million, and the average buyer premium increased 35% over the last year from 71,000 to 97,000. I believe this indicates that our expanded sales force is delivering higher quality assets, that investors are seeking, even in a price-challenged market. With roughly $1.5 trillion of CRE debt maturing in the next 24 months, and $700 billion maturing by year-end, we expect the continued interest rate-driven market shift to drive transaction volume up. Ten-X is already seeing an increase in momentum in the second quarter, with $1.7 billion of inventory come into the platform, a 44% increase from Q2 of 2022. Ten-X remains the go-to platform for accelerated asset transactions, which buyers, sellers, brokers, lenders and special servicers, benefit from as the markets continue to shift. Our land’s business is focused on creating opportunities for our real and clients to capture more leads for their priority properties for sale, with signature ad opportunities. This business continues its consistent profitable growth with 14% year-over-year revenue growth. STR has achieved a record sales quarter with the highest net new in its history, and delivered 14% year-over-year revenue growth, on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2022.  We're on track to launch our new benchmarking product this month, and execute our plan of migrating more than 175,000 users to the CoStar platform. This release will open access to new clients, including owners, hotel operators and brands that will enable execution of our integrated strategy. Owners will have clear visibility into asset performance, market performance and competitive landscape. This insight is invaluable for asset acquisition, repositioning and dispositioning. Operators, will have access to data and tools to better forecast budget, yield, manage and identify demand drivers and supply implications. Hotel brands will have a full suite to support and develop teams, franchise owners, relationships and management contracts, what's not to love about all that. Overall, higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty have reduced transaction volumes in the market, and impacted prices since the second half of 2022. As I mentioned earlier, transaction volumes declined by over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023, in the commercial real estate markets. In addition, we're now seeing asset price declines for seven consecutive months with valuations off by 8% over that time. The office sector continues to show real weakness with vacancy rates reaching almost 13% in the first quarter Phantom vacancy rate is much higher than that. And it's matching the all-time peak seen after the great financial crisis. With continued weak demand negative net absorption and other 58 million square feet of deliveries expected in 2023, we expect vacancies to push higher for the foreseeable future. Not surprisingly, delinquency rates on commercial property loans have doubled in the past three months to 2.8% and it's probably actually higher than that. Overall sales prices for office buildings are down 26% from their peak in Q1 of 2022. Fortunately, our 10x platform is well positioned to assist with the recapitalization of those properties as they come to market. The residential housing market remains constrained. Mortgage rates are down from the earlier highs at the end of last year, but affordability is still low by historical standards. Sales of existing homes tipped higher earlier this year after 12 consecutive months of declines. Sales of new homes have trended higher since reaching a bottom last year as builders are offering incentives like rate buydowns to clear inventories. Inventories remain tight which should prevent values from declining rapidly. The retail sector continues to benefit from reduced store closures, steady demand and minimal new supply. Available retail space fell to a new all-time low of 4.7% during the first quarter, leaving it difficult to find space strong market. Industrial net absorption has slowed in the first quarter after two years of record high net absorption and tenant demand is beginning to moderate. At 4.3% the US industrial vacancy rate is half of the levels recorded 10 years ago and rents have climbed 10% over the last 12 months still a strong market. I'm very pleased with the performance of our business in the first quarter. CoStar continues to grow and remain resilient despite industry headwinds elsewhere. Apartments.com and LoopNet show accelerating countercyclical sales success. I am very optimistic about the progress we're making building traffic and value at Homes.com. We're very pleased to see our array of diverse platforms drawing more than 94 million unique visitors in March and I look forward to reporting 100 million unique visitors before too long. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to the very capable hands of our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler. 
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. It's a great way to start the year, again. Financially, we are certainly on track, if not slightly ahead where we expected to be this quarter and for the year. With regards to revenue and our revenue growth outlook which is a 13% total revenue growth for 2023. Now, one of our sell-side analysts recently pointed out that we have logged 50 quarters in a row of double-digit revenue growth, although we actually just completed 48 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth, but who's counting. I actually use my favorite AI tool which I call an Excel spreadsheet to go back and figure out how many actual quarters we had double-digit growth. So it was back in 2011. So I am applying AI here at CoStar to our financial results.
Andy Florance: It might just be eye.
Scott Wheeler: The question of my eye sometimes. So revenue by services, CoStar revenue grew 13% in the first quarter. It was in line with our guidance expectations. CoStar expansion into new customers remain strong with new business sales consistently or slightly above the levels we've seen since mid-2021 after the pandemic. The brokers are certainly facing a tough transaction and leasing environment, which dampened new broker sales and renewal rates primarily among the very small broker shops. We expect that our revenue forecast will reflect the current market conditions, which would have CoStar revenue growing at 10% for the second quarter and for the full year of 2023. For multifamily, we added more than $35 million in year-over-year revenue during the first quarter on our way to once again achieving 20% revenue growth. Our bigger sales team is giving us the capacity to reach more and more prospective customers that have never advertised for Apartments.com. The number of paid properties increased by 8% in the first quarter of 2023 on a year-over-year basis. This is the largest volume increase we've seen since the second quarter of 2021. In addition, we're seeing more and more customers upgrading to higher level ads versus those that are downgrading to lower level ads. This net revenue contribution from the positive ad level mix is now back to the levels we saw last during the pandemic surge, which was the second quarter of 2020, which were certainly good strong high levels. Looking ahead, we expect these trends to continue with rising vacancy rates and increased productivity from our recent sales force expansion classes. So we're now forecasting revenue growth as Andy said of 23% for multifamily for the year and for the second quarter up from our prior guidance of 20% revenue growth for 2023. LoopNet revenue grew 16% in the first quarter up from 12% revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, thanks to the success of our dedicated LoopNet sales team. We expect 18% revenue growth for LoopNet in the second quarter of 2023 with a full year revenue growth that we now expect at the upper end of our 18% to 19% guidance range. Revenue from Information Services increased 12% in the first quarter at the upper end of the guidance range with strong results from STR and revenue contributions from our growing European businesses. We expect revenue growth for both the second quarter and the full year of 2023 to be 10% slightly above the 7% to 9% full year revenue growth guidance range that we provided in February. Our first quarter residential revenue came in at $13 million as expected. Estimated revenue for the second quarter is around $12 million with our full year 2023 revenue expectations remaining unchanged at $45 million. As a reminder, we've not assumed any revenues from Homes.com advertising products in our 2023 outlook. Other marketplace revenue contracted 4% in the first quarter of 2023, which was actually an improvement from the 10% to 13% first quarter revenue decline we expected a few months ago, as the trade rates for Ten-X that improved sequentially in the first quarter providing the extra revenue versus our forecast. We now expect revenue from other marketplaces to grow in the mid to high single-digits in the second quarter and we're increasing our full year revenue growth estimate to 11% to 12% based on the better-than-expected first quarter results. Adjusted EBITDA was $123 million in the first quarter, $7 million above the high end of our guidance range. The outperformance was primarily attributable to our strong revenue performance and the timing of marketing spend in the quarter, which we expect to reverse as we move into our peak marketing season in the second and third quarters. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21% in the first quarter one percentage point higher than our guidance. The size of the sales force in total remains largely unchanged from where we were at the end of 2022. The Apartments and LoopNet Marketplace teams grew in the first quarter sequentially offset by modest attrition across the rest of the sales force. Our focus for the rest of 2023 is to continue to increase our sales teams in the marketplace businesses, including apartments, LoopNet lands and residential. Our contract renewal rates remain in the 90% to 91% range, while the renewal rate in the first quarter for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer remained strong at 95%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts increased to 82% for the first quarter of 2023, up from 81% at the end of 2022 and 80% a year ago. Both CoStar and Apartments.com have our highest annual subscription concentration percentages. And as these two products grow in relative size we see our total subscription percentage increasing along with it. With a strong start to the year, we are reconfirming our revenue guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new revenue range of $2.465 billion to $2.48 billion implies revenue growth of 13% to 14% for the year. Second quarter 2023 fee revenue is expected to range from $603 million to $608 million, representing revenue growth of approximately 13% at the midpoint. We are also reconfirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance and raising the midpoint of our guidance range. The new adjusted EBITDA forecast range is now $505 million to $520 million. Our investments in the Homes.com, residential marketplace are yielding excellent results and our investment plans remains unchanged from what we communicated in February. For the second quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $118 million to $123 million, indicating a second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%. Before we move to Q&A, I want to reassure everyone that our cash and our investments are safe and sound with no adverse impacts from the failure of the Silicon Valley Bank and the other recent banking turmoils. We also have nothing related to First Republic Bank by the way. We maintain a very conservative treasury strategy that keeps our cash with only the strongest financial institutions and in the safest short-term investments. We actively manage our deposits to maximize interest income within the confines of our low-risk investment practices. In the first quarter, our $5.1 billion of cash earned a net interest of approximately 4.1% for the quarter, producing approximately $44 million of net interest income after deducting the interest expense on our debt. Projecting these results for the rest of the year is expected to yield net interest income of approximately $195 million, which is well above our prior estimates. We're raising our outlook for non-GAAP net income per diluted share to include our latest estimate of net interest income. We now expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.21 to $1.24, an increase from our prior guidance of around 15%, which is $0.15 per diluted share at the midpoint. So that about wraps it up for me. You can see we're in a very strong financial position as we head into the second quarter and our growth our investment and our profit plans are all on track for another great year. So with that, I will now turn the call back over to our operator for a little bit of Q&A. Hannah, back to you.
Operator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. You trimmed your CoStar Suite full year revenue growth guidance from 12% to 10%. How derisked is that outlook, given the current state of the commercial real estate market? And then related to that, you mentioned smaller broker weakness can you comment on the performance of your other customer types at CoStar Suite, as well as the latest pricing trends that you're realizing? Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: Sure, George. Thanks, for the question. So, we do take a quick -- a close look at all of our different customer sectors and how we're performing. As I mentioned, the sales that we're making into the growth sectors, owners, investors, lenders are at if not slightly above the levels we've been doing, over the last four to six quarters. And you just really see this one isolated sector, that is the smallest broker shops that are being impacted by the downturn in transactions and reduction in effort and potential layoffs, in that industry. So, we've taken a close look at that. We reflect those trends. We think that, the second and third quarters, are going to be rough in the industry. I think those are pretty well known economically. And so, we ride along with that sort of expectation and would hope that it starts to get better in the latter part of the year. So, we build all that into our forecast and we see that reflected in the 10%. So with the number of sectors holding up as strong as we have, and with the bigger sales force, we don't see this as being something that would be as disruptive as what happened in the pandemic or anything previous for us. So, we're pretty confident with what we've got built in so far. And then, question on pricing. Yes, we're following -- we follow inflation level pricing. So our -- as inflation levels come down, then we reduce the increases that we put in for renewals to just stay at the rate of inflation. And that's all. 
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you. 
Scott Wheeler: Sure.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Tong. The next question is from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citi. You may proceed.
Peter Christiansen: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Andy, just wondering can you elaborate, a little bit on how you're seeing the pipeline for Ten-X, the relationships that you've built, I guess since acquiring the asset -- and how you see that pipeline evolving, I guess, as potentially we hit more distress over the coming months, years. How do you see that evolving versus how Ten-X was prior to being acquired. Thank you.
Andy Florance: So, surprisingly, still today, the vast majority of product that's trading on the platform is performing assets. So, we are it takes quite some time for when market conditions become adverse to when you actually see, effectively capitulation in people begin to exit investments that have gone south. So, we're still a performing asset platform at this point, but we're seeing less spread between buyer expectations and seller expectations. So, there's the trade rates are coming up. You can see the volume increasing this quarter, as that happens. And we would expect that to continue to climb up through the year. We have a much larger sales organization than we've had in the past, to be able to capture that opportunity. Plus, we've also completely integrated all of the systems of Ten-X into the CoStar and LoopNet platforms. So, we're dramatically more efficient, as we want to take on new assets. We also are more disciplined now on, making sure that we do not bring on any assets that the seller does not have realistic expectations for. So, our commitment committee on the Ten-X management team is very disciplined. So it's somewhat awkward. You don't want to see a flood of inventory coming into Ten-X, because it means that the market has gone really south. But with the federal government continuing to work from home, you'll probably see a lot of office assets go now.
Peter Christiansen: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Christiansen. The next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. You may proceed.
Stephen Sheldon: Yes. Thanks. LoopNet, really strong booking trends there, so do you think you're at full stride there with the expanded sales force, or is there still a lot more to go I guess in terms of ramping productivity. And then can you talk about the demand environment in LoopNet given the trend in office vacancy rates? It seems like a great environment right now. But do you also think that you could be a point where vacancy rates trend too high, some property owners capitulate and just assume they're not going to find tenants and therefore reduce ad spend? And I guess essentially is there an optimal range for office vacancy rates from your perspective to maximize demand at LoopNet. And if so, what do you think that is?
Andy Florance: Yeah. I don't think there's an upper-end. What we see in the past -- so we've been selling advertising solutions to commercial property owners for quite some time now from when it was in books to when it was in CD-ROMs to when it's on the Internet. And when the market conditions get really awful at the upper-end of high vacancy rates, what you find is that the assets recapitalized a new owner comes in at a much lower cost basis. The cost of our advertising is de minimis or relevant in the cost -- the context of the cost of the building and they're actually very aggressive in advertising. So the biggest advertising spends I've ever seen, is from owners who picked up bankrupt assets, new owners have picked up. And they're basically coming in there with lower price points than the than the remaining properties that hadn't yet gone under because they've got a lower cost basis. So I think there's no -- I don't believe, that there's any upper-end to vacancy rate and demand for our asset LoopNet. Obviously right when someone's going bankrupt they stop but it's made up for by now the new owner coming in aggressively. I actually think we have a lot of room to go. I look at one or two other businesses overseas and I look at what they're generating in revenue for commercial real estate advertising on the Internet. And just interpolate that by GDP and it suggests we have a doubling, tripling, quadrupling of revenue to go. So I'm looking forward to continuing to grow the LoopNet sales force and continue to optimize our pricing models and to increase the functionality, and I also think that moving LoopNet, Pan-European will have a huge benefit. I spent a lot of time listening to focus group interviews with corporate users and investors who move across borders. And as we provide a solution that crosses borders I think that will increase demand for assets marketed on LoopNet, which would be another positive demand driver. So if you can't tell I'm bullish on LoopNet and remain bullish on LoopNet. 
Scott Wheeler: As you should. 
Andy Florance: Though it was once a competitor. 
Stephen Sheldon: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Sheldon. The next question is from John Campbell with Stephens. You may proceed.
John Campbell: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions.
Andy Florance: Sure.
John Campbell: The first one is -- I guess a two-part question here. So first off a great job on the Homes.com traffic ramp that was a really impressive early start for you guys. So first on the roughly $53 million of sequential -- up in sales and marketing how much of that was tied to resi?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. So we haven't indicated how much residential marketing spend as you can appreciate, John. So I think you see every sequential quarter we'll get more and more marketing coming in total as all of our marketplaces get into the more of the rental and high-volume seasons in the second and third quarter. But we'll just keep the discussion to the overall company at this stage? 
John Campbell: Okay. And I guess just broadly you're expecting that sales and marketing step up sequentially throughout the remainder of the year even in 4Q. 
Scott Wheeler: Yes. So I think what you'll see is our pattern will step up in second quarter. We're going to step up even more in third as we get closer to our product launch in residential then you'll see clearly we'll be preparing the market for that. And then I think what we'll see is the fourth quarter will be higher than most of our fourth quarters previously because we have an additional platform that we're doing brand marketing for now this year versus prior years. So you see a bit more of a spend that carries in later in the year than we've had before because of the addition of the new platform. So hopefully that helps. 
Andy Florance: But if you see anyone from -- that we're spending all the money in Madrid. 
John Campbell: We'll do. And then Andy back, I guess, big picture question for resi. As you look out the next couple of quarters what would you offer up as key milestones you'd like to see the team hit. 
Andy Florance: Well for the next -- there's a lot going on. I mean it is a very full plate of initiatives and there's well over 1,000 people working on the initiative right now. I think that the traffic numbers remain a key metric that we're watching obviously. As we mentioned we plan to begin to monetize the platform at the very end of the year. And the first 1,000 customers on that platform are probably the most important customers that you may one day have hundreds of thousands or millions. The first 1,000 the most important. But I would stay with -- I would just stay with the simple traffic numbers. Now I believe that critical traffic numbers are what we talked about before 25 million which we've crossed 50 million which we're moving towards. Beyond that 50 million mark you really have what you need to produce some compelling marketing solutions for your clients and you can really begin to monetize. So I think the numbers correctly you correctly observed that I would say that one of the biggest risk factors for Homes.com has just been reduced with these results today if you're watching. 
John Campbell: Lot of sense. Thank you, Andy.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Campbell. The next question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. You may proceed.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to drill down further on the CoStar Suite. I was wondering if you can quantify what percentage of the revenue really comes from the smaller midsized brokers where you might potentially see any kind of headwinds. And then just to follow-up, Andy, on your comment around the prospects owners, lenders, and corporations, which represents a $1.4 billion opportunity. I was wondering how much percentage of the revenue comes from those right now? And how should we think about that trajectory for the rest of the year but also over the next few years? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: So let me take the first part of the question there, Ashish. When you look at our broker mix in CoStar, a little over 35% of our CoStar revenue is from the broker pool, and then about 25% of that group is representative of small, what we call the one or two broker set. So that gives you 25% or 35%. So it's roughly 8% of that pool. So it's pretty limited exposure for now in the small broker set.
Andy Florance: And to be clear, they don't all go away. It's really having watched this a few times. It's the folks who are 67 years old, who decided to step out at the cycle point. So it's a subset of the group. And there's some -- obviously some other constituencies. So the majority of our revenue today is the owners, lenders and a smaller component is the corporate users. Obviously we have government in there. We have vendors. We have a whole number of other sectors. I believe that the -- while the brokerage side of our business continues to grow, I believe that those owner, lender, corporate user sectors are going to be by far the biggest growth driver and coupled with international demand over the next three to four years. So, I think this is a trend that's been going on for two decades now. So I think when we went public, 85%, 90% of our revenue was brokers, so while that revenues continue to grow. It's now only 35%. So as it continues to grow, I'd anticipate five years from now, it will only be 15% -- 10%, 15% of our revenue, something like that.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s great. That’s very helpful color. Thanks Andy and Scott.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Sabadra. The next question is from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham. You may proceed.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening. Andy, of the 15 countries -- or was it cities that you mentioned the focal point in Europe, is that going to be an organic initiative, or do you think you could buy assets in these regions that could help accelerate the traction there to be able to penetrate that $30 billion opportunity. And when should we expect meaningful revenue contribution from this initiative?
Andy Florance: Yes. So, there definitely are acquisition opportunities in Europe. There are very few companies that in Europe that none that do exactly what we do in the CoStar information side, they're more on the marketplace side, they're more on the marketplace side, similar to LoopNet or to Homes.com. There's not a lot of Apartments.com players over there. But on the CoStar side, we really stand alone. One of the key initiatives is, to build the comprehensive information grid, by doing the field research and proactive research that is a two- to three-year process. So, then you see meaningful. You see, significant meaningful monetization on the CoStar side, really two to three years out. On the LoopNet side, or on the marketplace side, I think it would be a little bit sooner, probably 18 months or so. But we have our head down doing, what we've done many times before which is capturing the whole -- all the content, the core content. And the wonderful thing is, we seem to be the only people in the world, that like to go out and do something that hard and crazy, and then it becomes very valuable once we go and do it. We're pretty good at it. And the wonderful thing is, that technology has never been better, than it is today to do what we do when we build inventory. So, we can use machine vision now, to look at aerial photographs compare them to the millions and millions of other properties, and aerial photographs we've got. We can very precisely direct our field researchers, and make them very, very efficient as they move through these markets. So, it will be a good adventure and I think there'll be some great returns for it. And I remain convinced, that the market for the demand for Ten markets is 20 times the demand for…
Mayank Tandon: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Tandon. The next question is from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. You may proceed.
Jeff Silber: Thank you so much. This is I guess a follow-up from the prior question. You've obviously, got a sizable cash balance. It's great to see that you're generating more interest income off of there. But when do you think, you might put that cash balance to work? And where would that cash balance be working? 
Andy Florance: I think, we -- I believe that our organic initiatives, are not going to exceed our EBITDA generation or cash flow generation. We don't see anything like that at this point. So, it's really acquisition opportunities. We're -- we have been very patient. We believe that, there's better value opportunities. And as I listened to Scott described, $5.1 billion in cash. I believe it's a wonderful time to have a great balance sheet, as other companies may run into some troubles.  And so, both in Europe and the United States, we believe there are opportunities. We continue to have conversations. You probably have read in the media about a number of conversations, we have had that were substantive. We did take a four-week holiday from -- after the latest round of media reports, but there's still a lot out there. And I have meetings this week, but you won't know where. 
Jeff Silber: All right. Fair enough. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Silber. The next question is from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you. I appreciate you taking my question. I'd love to ask you about the residential piece. You talked about where you are on a traffic basis. There's less risk going forward. I know you're not kind of telling us specifically your sort of spending plans for this year and beyond this year. But if things continue to progress at the rate they do and the pace they do kind of how do you see things evolving at a high level? Can you just kind of help us kind of see your path between now and 2027? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Heather, can you specifically talking about investments or combination of investments and traffic?
Heather Balsky: Well, I guess, the investment side and how it's tied to your thoughts around how sales progress. 
Andy Florance: Yes. So I think this -- the remainder of this year I believe is fairly predictable. People have a good idea of what we're doing in the remainder of this year. The wonderful thing is that we have pulled just a small percentage of the levers we have to grow traffic. So some of the things that I think are -- I think there's more traffic generation opportunities ahead of us this year that we -- than those that are behind us. So it makes me feel pretty good about our ability to hit our second traffic goal as the year comes to a close or just slightly thereafter, which mean way on schedule. I'm very excited about our simple monetization strategy at the tail end of this year. I think it's straightforward. I think it's compelling. And I think we can spin up a sales operation to support it pretty quickly. As we my hope is that as we can begin to show proof of concept against that sales initiative in the later part of the year going into 2024 than we can do what we did with Apartments.com where we are showing proof-of-concept and results and invest against that proof of concept and result into what is a huge market. So it's too early to say what we're doing in 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 for investments it will be a balance between what we're showing in revenue results versus what we're willing to invest into the business. So -- but it's probably 60%, 70% of my time right now. And I'm pleased with -- I'm pleased with where it's going. And it's a lot of work, but we have a great team and feel pretty good about it. But obviously, we're the underdog as we were in the early days of Apartments.com. And so you have to be coming up with some unique ideas and different strategies. And I think I feel pretty good about that what we've got going on. 
Heather Balsky: Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Ms. Balsky. The next question is from Ryan Tomasello with KBW.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two-part one here. Clearly a lot of confidence in the resiliency of the business, but just given uncertainty that's out there around macro and CRU. It'd just be helpful to hear your thoughts around your willingness to pull expense levers under the scenario that the sales environment does weaken more than you're hoping. And as a follow-up on the Homes.com traffic trends, maybe you could elaborate a bit more Andy on what levers you've leaned on so far to drive that traffic growth in terms of I guess, SEO, SEM, synergies with apartments and what remaining levers you have to pull that you just alluded to? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yes. So, I don't think we want to go into too much detail on our traffic strategies right now, just for competitive reasons. I would point out that we have the greenest residential real estate portal around, because our load time with the homepage is ranges from four milliseconds to something like -- 24 milliseconds. So that gives us a BA [ph] on Google Analytics for performance time, which means you consume less electricity and generate less carbon and we only generate 0.22 grams per 10,000 loads. So, super efficient high performance is a key piece that we've done. And I hope that officiates what we're doing in strategy for traffic. But I think we've talked about some of those traffic strategies and some of it self-evident like what we haven't yet done, which we're going to be doing and the things that we've done in apartments that are in the past successfully that we've talked about today that have not yet been done with homes that are self-evident. So, yeah, there's more ahead than there is in the rearview mirror on the traffic performance. But congrats to Jerry Rodgers and his team for such great performance that benefits your SEO growth. So and our willingness to -- if the market continues to degrade significantly sure, we're always -- we're always responsive to any need to sort of pullback on initiatives where we're not seeing a market perform because of severe economic conditions. We are prepared to do cost containment efforts. But realistically, in the very worst markets over the last 35 years we've rarely seen -- I think the worst we ever saw was a 2%, 3% decline when we were only selling co-started brokers. We are so much more diverse now. And we have so many what I believe are countercyclical drivers whether it be lender or Ten-X or marketing for high-asset value items that I think it's unlikely that we'd be in a situation where we have to really pullback because of the economy. So, I'm quite impressed by this particular down cycle and the potential.
Scott Wheeler: Yeah. Well, you noticed -- I mean, we look very closely at the last disruptions that happened, the pandemic in 2020 and the great financial crisis more than a decade ago. And as you proceed through each of those you noticed in the last down cycle that our revenue growth didn't slow at all and we see nothing even as disruptive of that this time. And you just look, what's happening with apartments and LoopNet proving to overbalance countercyclical that our revenue growth is not going to slow at this balance in a down cycle and we don't see that coming at all. And we do see a lot of clear data underneath as you might suspect on what's going on. So, our portfolio is much stronger as even three years ago and I think we saw that in the results that we announced today. 
Operator: Thank you Mr. Tomasello. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So I will turn the call over to Andy to wrap it up -- wrap the call up. 
Andy Florance : Wow. We finished seven minutes early. Well, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you again in our second quarter call in July 25, 2023 at 05:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. So thank you very much for participating today, and have a good evening, or a good day, if you're in Asia. Bye-bye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-21 17:00:00) =====

Andrew Florance: Thank you, Cyndi. Good work. That was fantastic Safe Harbor. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Total revenue for the full year of 2022 was $2.2 billion or 12% year-over-year growth coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. Our fourth quarter revenue grew 13% on a constant currency basis over the fourth quarter of 2021, up to $573 million. This is our 12th year in a row with double digit revenue growth. We had a phenomenal year in sales. We delivered the highest net new sales ever with 2022 sales reaching $305 million or 41% growth over the net new sales in 2021. We delivered exceptional sales results in the fourth quarter as well with annualized net new sales bookings of $77 million. This is a 15% increase over the same quarter in 2021 and our second highest quarterly net sales bookings result ever. Apartments.com had their highest sales quarter ever exceeding their prior record set in the second quarter of 2020 by 25%. So a shout out to [Page Forest] (ph) and her entire team at Apartments.com. We substantially increased the size of our sales force in 2022, adding almost 300 people net. We had a very strong profit performance in 2022 as well. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was $672 million, which was also above the high end of our guidance range and consensus estimates. Overall, we had an exceptional year with both strong sales and profit performance, while continuing to invest and grow the business. Apartments.com revenue was $198 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 16% over the fourth quarter of 2021 and $740 million for the full year was a 10% increase over the prior year. Apartments.com delivered another outstanding quarter with a record in sales and an increase in net bookings of 177% over the same period last year. 2022 was an exceptional year for Apartments.com, our efforts to attract talented sales professionals give them world class training and get them into production paid dividends. We increased the sales force by 40%, adding over 100 sales representatives to the team. At the same time, we were able to increase our sales productivity with monthly net new sales up 187% as compared to 2021. The team also conducted 450,000 quality meetings, both with existing clients and potential prospects, the highest number of meetings in our history. We maintained a very impressive Net Promoter Score with our clients of 93%. The Apartments.com brand is stronger than ever. In 2022, we delivered over 1.2 billion visits to our platforms. Our award winning marketing campaign featuring the wonderful and funny Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, inventor of the Apartminternet entertained audiences and delivered over 12 billion impressions across linear TV and our other 130 media channels. We continue to reach renters and potential renters where they consume the most content including streaming video, audio, social media platforms and through marketing influencers. Our investments keep proving successful with the new all-time high and unaided brand awareness in the fourth quarter and the number one ranking among our target audience. Rent Dynamics, a leading CRM platform for multifamily properties conducted analysis of over 500,000 rental leads submitted in the fourth quarter of 2022. They determined that the Apartments.com network converted leads to leases at twice the rate of Zillow. To be clear, this data shows that a community would have to get twice as many leads from Zillow as from Apartments.com in order to provide the community with an equal number of leases. In fact, the same studies show that Apartments.com network provided communities with almost 4 times more leases than the Zillow rental network and over 9 times more leases than rent period. As we look ahead, we are well positioned to penetrate the existing -- the estimated $1.4 billion marketing opportunity in apartment buildings which have less than 50 units, but more than five. In 2022, we more than doubled our sales force dedicated to this opportunity and in the fourth quarter we introduced flexible listing plans. The perfect solution for managers who oversee multiple properties in this under 50 unit apartment category. The product allows managers the flexibility to swap properties they advertise at any time based on their current needs and upcoming availabilities. I'm proud to say we launched Apartments.com in Canada in the fourth quarter, marking the brand's first expansion outside the United States. Renters in Canada may now search Canadian geographies for apartments, homes, condos and town homes for rent. Searches can be conducted in English or [French] (ph). Some of the key clients in the United States have either already moved into Canada or plans to move in 2023 and we're ready to support them. 42 of Canada's largest property management companies have already provided us with their data on their communities and we've acquired listing data from the Canadian Real Estate Association. This allows us to present rental listings for various Canadian MLSs on Apartments.com. We have already experienced enormous traffic growth since our recent launch and are positioned at or near the top of organic spot for searches. We believe we are well positioned to penetrate this $600 million estimated Canadian apartment marketing opportunity with our strong brand and unique product offerings. The U.S. macroeconomic conditions continue to support an increase in the demand for advertising. U.S. multifamily vacancy rates rose another 50 basis points to 7.1% compared to the last quarter. The U.S. and Canadian market conditions along with the strength of our brand and our sales force give us confidence in our ability to return to 20% annual revenue growth. CoStar revenue was $837 million and 2022, up 16% over the prior year, making it an outstanding year. CoStar net new sales were record high and 16% more than our prior highest sales year. Both the North American and European sales teams delivered the highest net new sales ever. We added over 60 new sales representatives to the CoStar team this past year, which is an increase of almost 20% over 2021. We're in the final stages of transitioning customers to the global CoStar platform, which to date has generated over $40 million in incremental revenue. We launched the CoStar Lender product, which generated almost $6 million already in net new sales and 140 new customers and we're just getting started there. This quarter, we expect to complete the process of linking over 70,000 commercial properties to 12,600 investment funds or property investment funds, providing our clients with insights into these property fund portfolios. The product will allow a user to search for funds raising capital and those with dry powder to invest and gather insights into a fund manager's investment strategy property type, target country or -- and/or transaction history. We're about to deliver significant enhancements to our tenant product as well. In the past, our tenant product has provided our users with valuable details on over 5 million tenant locations. With the coming upgrade of [tenant] (ph) will provide users with an aggregated roll up of all of a given company's locations so that the user can better understand how the most important tenants utilize space across their portfolios and how our clients can best capitalize on these various tenants' space needs. CoStar definitely had a tremendous year. I'm confident in our ability to continue to grow at double digit rates with the strength of our product capabilities, high renewal rates and continued ongoing thoughtful investments. LoopNet fourth quarter revenue was $61 million up 12% over the prior year. Net new sales bookings in 2022 set a record for LoopNet. Net new sales in the fourth quarter were up 198% over the fourth quarter of last year and trailing 12 month net new sales were up 56% over 2021. We added over 100 sales representatives to LoopNet in 2022, which almost quadrupled the size of the LoopNet sales team. With the successful launch of LoopNet in Canada and U.K. we now have a growing international offering. We have planned launches in France and Spain in 2023. Our brand and our product remains strong with traffic to LoopNet network of sites continuing to outperform competition dramatically, both domestically and internationally. LoopNet now ranks number one for 129,000 relevant commercial keywords on Google, and we have twice the number of keywords ranked in the top three positions than our next closest competitor. In 2023, we'll continue to grow the sales force as well as our SEM investment along with our digital and broad based media campaigns. The new marketing campaign will be focused on elevating LoopNet brand owners and brokers across a mix of multimedia channels, including linear, digital and social platforms. These marketing efforts will drive leads to our expanded sales force and reposition our -- reinforce our position as the most popular place to find a space. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made building out the LoopNet team and its international platform, which gives confidence in our ability to achieve our target of 18% to 19% revenue growth in 2023. STR's revenue growth accelerated from single digit growth in the first quarter of 2022 to 12% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis. The hotel industry has recovered in the U.S. average daily rates and revenue per room are well ahead of pre pandemic levels. Internationally, the industry isn't far behind. Current market conditions put us in a great position to launch our new benchmarking product, which we believe will provide incredible new variable to hotel brands, operators and owners around the world. Our new benchmarking product combines the very best of STR's deep hotel industry acumen and expertise with CoStar's innovative technology and industry leading software. Users will find an interactive benchmarking platform with areas that preserve the familiarity of the star report, whilst introducing new features and functionality in analytics charts and graphs to deliver additional insights into their hotel's performance. The deep proprietary performance data and user defined competitive sets aggregates will be available for users to manage their properties, set rate and occupancy strategies and optimize performance. CoStar now houses an inventory of more than 0.25 million hotels, including 77,000 benchmarking participants in over 180 countries with 175,000 unique users for that information. These users will access their performance data and industry data from 572 hospitality markets, 1,900 submarkets and over 6,000 class segments in their selected currency. Owners will have clear visibility into asset performance, market performance and the competitive landscape. This insight is valuable for asset acquisition, repositioning and disposition. Operators will have access to data and tools to better forecast budget yield, manage and identify demand drivers and supply implications. Hotel Brands will have its full suite to support development teams, franchise and owner relationships and management contracts. During 2023, we'll be migrating those 175,000 users, including 900 corporate customers and 6,000 independent hotels to this new digital marketing platform base in CoStar. They've already begun to integrate the outputs with their workflows and we're experiencing significant product -- and are experiencing significant productivity improvements. In short, we're on track to achieve our goal to effectively utilize a digital product that an entire industry relies on and unlocks significant new value for our clients. These enhancements will help us to gain further share and penetrate the $300 million addressable hotel market. Ten-X brought $5 billion in assets to the platform for sale in 2022 for an increase of 42% year-over-year. That's the highest level we've seen the platform since 2012. Ten-X closed $2.5 billion of those asset sales which is up 16% over last year and the highest level since 2016. This performance was in the face of a significant slowdown in overall commercial real estate sales volumes, which had declined almost 55% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to see consistency in the percentage of non-distressed assets brought to the platform at approximately 80%, indicating that the volume of distressed sales has not yet picked up. Full year revenue for Ten-X grew 11% year-over-year. In 2022, we made significant progress enhancing the platform. We've now fully integrated Ten-X with our CoStar and LoopNet platforms and that's driving sales and operating efficiencies. We had our first buyer bid on a Ten-X property from within LoopNet last week and they won the auction for that property. So they're really fully integrated now. With integration, Ten-X is now positioned to handle dramatically higher volumes. We've also doubled our Ten-X sales force since the last year. New Ten-X sales represents with tenure under 24 months are productive and brought 318% more assets to the platform in 2022 than the prior year and they accounted for 55% of total assets. The commercial property transaction market is in a period of disruption with $93 billion of CMBS loans expected to come due in 2023. Trade rates continue to reflect the spread in buyer and seller expectations. Ten-X continues to maintain a significant advantage of the old offline trade rates and we've exceeded those by 81% over the course of 2021. So we're in a down market dramatically more effective. A digital platform that can close a transaction within 90 days as compared to the market average offline of approximately 300 days has a significant advantage and is well positioned for challenging market conditions. I'm pleased to report that we're making significant gains in building consumer traffic on Homes.com. Unique visitors to Homes.com climbed 130% year-over-year in January according to Google Analytics. Our SEO traffic to Homes.com increased 78% month over month in January. Our SEO traffic to Homes.com increased 78%% month over month in January. According to ComScore, January 2023 over January 2022, our Homes.com traffic increased 100%, while ComScore indicated Realtor.com com was down 15%, Zillow was down 6% and Redfin was relatively flat at about 6%. In total, our Homes.com network had approximately 24 million unique visitors in January according to Google Analytics. We still have a lot of work to do here, but we have a clear roadmap and have our heads down focused on building the best residential real estate portal in the United States. Our team is excited to be working on this. They're highly motivated and committed to the mission. We believe that given our progress in building traffic to date, we'll be in a position to begin monetizing Homes.com in the later part of this year. We now have over 1 million agents registered on our Homes.com platform, which is an increase of 33% over last year. During the year, we successfully integrated the back ends of Homes.com and Homesnap platforms into one efficient residential technology stack. We're making significant progress executing on your listing your lead strategy. While other sites are injecting their agents into the homebuyers search experience somewhat awkwardly, we offer a friction free environment connecting buyers directly to the listing agents who know the property and the home best that the buyers interested in. We're also presenting consumers with hundreds of thousands of highly qualified potential buyer agents for free based upon those buyer agent skills and experiences rather based on how much the buyer agent is willing to give up in commission to the portal. We believe that we offer a dramatically better consumer experience than do sites that try and take commission split from the inquiries buyers submit. I've used some of these competing sites myself and submitted leads on properties I'm interested in. The experience is remarkably awful. The moment you submit a lead and for months afterwards, you're bombarded with cold calls from countless agents who have questionable qualifications. We believe that Homes.com offers a significantly improved consumer experience over that competition. Not only do we believe we offer a superior consumer experience for buyers, we also believe we are much better aligned with real estate agents. The competing models use all the agents' listings in a market to funnel monetize leads to just a very small percentage of agents. So, some of these competing models are diverting all the agents' leads to a small number of agents who are paying the portal. In their model, these few agents pay a huge fees and the vast majority of agents get little value if not downright disadvantage by these competitors. We believe that by respecting your listing your lead, we can serve all the agents better. We are not just providing value to the agents with the listing though, we're making it easier for buyers to find agents who have expertise and experience that are the best match for the needs of those buyers and then facilitating connecting with them and collaborating with them without us trying to again inject ourselves in the process inappropriately. Our product development and research teams have now released a robust agent directory featuring hundreds of thousands of agents and extensive media to enhance their profiles. Our agent collaboration tools are up and running. We've had tremendous feedback from both agents and consumers. The interactive experience replaces the historically inefficient email and text communications back and forth between agents and homebuyers. We've successfully previewed this new Homes.com at the National Association of Realtors Convention in November where we demonstrate our product to close to 2,000 agents and we received very positive feedback across the board. Revenue for residential segment was $74 million in 2022, which was roughly flat compared to revenue in 2021. As we mentioned in our last call, this is legacy Homesnap revenue, mostly selling social media and search engine advertising to agents. We believe that this revenue is less strategic and less sticky than the revenue we'll generate from a high intent marketplace like Homes.com. We have effectively transitioned most of our sales resources to other higher yield marketplaces as we continue to deemphasize the Homesnap products in favor of future Homes.com revenue. In the later part of the year, we'll begin to bring more sales resources back on to the residential segment in the Homes.com product. Our planned investment into marketing to drive traffic to Homes.com will increase later in the year as we approach the point where we are ready to monetize Homes.com. As you've heard us say before, CoStar is always assessing opportunities to maximize shareholder value, including strategic acquisitions. And the discussions announced last month by News Corp with respect to a potential sale of Move Inc., the operator of Realtor.com were part of that ongoing effort. While we typically do not comment on potential acquisition opportunities in light of News Corp's prior announcements, we are confirming here at this point CoStar Group is not acquiring Realtor.com. We have tremendous respect for the people behind Realtor.com and for the National Association of Realtors. But again, I need to make it clear. At this point, CoStar Group is not acquiring Realtor.com. We continue to believe that Homes.com's business model and our principals are well aligned with the interest of NAR members and real estate agents generally. Turning to the real estate economy. The office sector continues to show weakness with vacancies up 13% of the past 14 quarters and now stands at 14.6%. Availability rates are much higher at 18.5%. Many second generation office properties are now in significant distress. We expect to see many of these owners with no choice but to hand the keys back to the bank. We're well positioned to assist in recapitalizing those properties on Ten-X as they come to market. I do believe that there is hope of recovery in the out years for office though. A recent Castle Index reading showed a possible shift in momentum as office usage climbed over to 50% mark over the pre-pandemic levels. That means that for the first time since the pandemic more people are working in an office than are working at home. I believe that's because people are more productive, efficient and in touch when they work together in person. I also believe that teams work together are more competitive. While we expect vacancies to continue to rise and office properties continue to be negatively impacted in the near term, we see the continued return to work trend as a positive sign for the office sector's future. With 1.3 million office using jobs added since the beginning of the pandemic, and negative 118 million square feet of absorption over the same time period, there may be significant pent up demand for office space. The industrial sector posted a healthy fourth quarter and the sector is seeing an unprecedented amount of new supply due to high levels of demand for goods seen since beginning of the start of the pandemic or since the start of the pandemic. The sector's vacancies are at half of their long term average. The retail sector exhibited the strongest fundamentals in the fourth quarter and was the only asset class to see vacancies decline. Relatively strong demand and relatively low supply are both a continuation of trends we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic. Demand has outpaced new supply for seven consecutive quarters leading to a fourth quarter vacancy of 4.2%, the lowest retail vacancy rate ever recorded. So it would appear that the death of retail real estate was only a rumor. The residential housing market is continuing to see softness. Home prices soared during the pandemic due to cheap money, but now mortgage rates have climbed over 7%, as you likely know. In combination, this has resulted in terrible affordability issue at levels not seen in more than 30 years. With buyers being priced out of the market and existing homeowners being discouraged from moving due to having finances at historically low rates, existing home sales have fallen for the 11th consecutive month. An overall drop of 38%. We've recently celebrated our introduction to the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500. That's probably connected to the fact that we've now achieved 12 straight years of double-digit revenue growth. 2022 was our highest net new sales bookings year ever, and we now have over 1,100 productive sales representatives, executing on many of our significant market opportunities. We published our second environmental and social and governance report, which you can find in the Investor Relations sector of our website, highlighting our ESG goals and accomplishments for 2022. We are now reporting our baseline greenhouse gas emissions. Inside CoStar Group, we continue to prioritize being a leader in sustainability. We have a hybrid or electric fleet of over 200 research vehicles, we select LEED certified or ENERGY STAR rate of buildings for most of our 80-plus offices. We have facilitated over 30 million virtual tours through Apartments.com, LoopNet, Homes.com land marketplaces thereby potentially avoiding massive amounts of carbon that would have been created by people driving for traditional physical property tours. We've also increased the transparency of our human capital disclosures, including publishing both our EEO-1 and pay GAAP analysis. I am extremely proud of our diverse and equitable workforce. I'm encouraged by all that we've done and all that we're still poised to do in making CoStar Group as sustainable, transparent and a diverse as company as can be. Our 2022 employee engagement scores climbed to a well above average 83%, which is the highest engagement scores we've ever obtained. We're also proud to have a highly engaged workforce, which is reflected in our low average monthly voluntary turnover rate of just 1.6%, which is way below the professional and business services industry rate of 3.3%. So with that, at this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our approximately 83% engaged Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I think I'll get through about 83% of my script, and then I'll turn off the mic, how's that Tim. Actually, I think you are probably increasing or you brought down our turnover rate given your tenure here at the company. So thank you for that contribution. So as Andy talked to a lot of this, so that 2022 is certainly a very strong year for the business, particularly in light of all the economic uncertainty we've had with inflation and higher interest rates, continued fears of recessions. You've seen so many technology companies, particularly property technology companies that have seen steep revenue declines and their cost cutting in this past year. But fortunately, that certainly is not our CoStar situation. We've pointed this out many times before over the years, but it's certainly worth repeating. Our business model is extremely resilient to economic and transactional fluctuations. We have mission-critical information, countercyclical marketplaces, a disciplined subscription revenue model with 90-plus percent renewal rates, and we have a monstrous balance sheet. All in all, we're coming out of 2022 stronger than ever. It's important and strategic, I believe, at this time for us to continue to invest in our biggest growth opportunities. As similar to our strategy in 2015 when we increased investment levels to build Apartments.com which we believe is now the undisputed leading rental marketplace in the United States and soon Canada. More on that later. So financially, in the fourth quarter and in 2022, we certainly crushed it all around. We beat our revenue goals every quarter, topping the high end of our guidance range once again in the fourth quarter. Our $2.18 of revenue for the year is well above the initial forecast that we communicated at the beginning of 2022. Our organic revenue growth rate was 12% for the year. Profit results for 2022 also came in above expectations with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our commercial information and marketplace businesses delivered strong operating leverage, improving margins by 300 basis points in 2022 to get within 1% of our established 40% margin goal for the year, and we made excellent progress with our residential investment program while spending less. Overall, we ended the year with $672 million in adjusted EBITDA, which was 15% above the middle of the guidance range that we set out to start the year. We're determined to repeat and improve upon our 2022 performance in 2023 using the same strategic formula. Our focus is on accelerating revenue growth in our Commercial Information and marketplace businesses while delivering cost productivity, operating leverage and strong margins. This commercial business engine is expected to provide increased profit levels and cash flow to fund our growth investments, most notably our Homes.com residential marketplace expansion. With regards to revenue performance and outlook in our various businesses, I'm going to have to give my MVP vote this year to Apartments.com. Our multifamily revenue growth continued to accelerate throughout 2022, ending the year at 16% in the fourth quarter, up 5 percentage points from 11% revenue growth in the third quarter. We see positive signs in both volume and ad level mix. The number of properties advertising on the Apartments.com network continues to grow, and we're now at a peak level of over 62,000. As vacancy rates increase, we see more properties moving up ad levels to increase their exposure and their lead volumes creating positive revenue mix. We expanded our sales force in 2022 by 40% in Apartments.com, and we certainly expect these new sellers to increase their productivity in 2023. So we expect revenue growth to increase to 19% in the first quarter of 2023 and 20% for the full year for Apartments.com. That's truly an amazing comeback this past year for the team, and the best is still ahead. CoStar revenue grew 15% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, in line with our previous guidance. CoStar's 2022 revenue growth rate was 7 percentage points higher than that of 2021 on the strength of our sales efforts and the global product upgrade initiative, which to date has contributed approximately $40 million of revenue to CoStar. For full year 2023, we expect CoStar revenue growth to moderate somewhat to 12% as the global product upgrade campaign nears completion and our CPI renewal pricing is expected to soften throughout the year with the rates of CPI. We expect CoStar revenue growth in the first quarter of 2023 to be approximately 13%. LoopNet revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year of 2022, in line with our guidance. Over the past 12 months, we've increased our LoopNet sales team by over 100 heads with two-thirds of those hires joining us in the last six months. Our LoopNet dedicated sales team made a significant contribution to the increase in net new bookings of over 50% for the year. As our new sellers ramp up their experience and productivity in the year ahead, we expect further increases in LoopNet sales. We expect first quarter 2023 LoopNet revenue growth in the 14% to 16% range and full year growth around 18% to 19%. Residential revenue was $16 million in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year, up slightly from the $73 million guidance we previously provided. We now estimate that the revenue of approximately $45 million will be in 2023 for residential, a reduction of around $30 million. Half of that reduction is revenue from the concierge lead scrubbing product with another 25% of the decline resulting from the annualization of Homes.com and MLS revenues that we discontinued in 2022. Homesnap Pro and Pro Plus continue to perform well with over 1 million registered users and nearly 500,000 active agents on the platform. We expect residential revenue of approximately $13 million in the first quarter. We've not included estimated revenue from Homes.com advertising products at this time in our 2023 forecast. We'll provide further updates as we make progress throughout the year. Other marketplace revenue was $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a growth rate of 8% year-over-year. Our lands for sale and business for sale marketplaces continue to perform well, growing 17% in aggregate in the fourth quarter of 2022. Ten-X continues to generate solid revenues despite the significant disruption in the transaction markets, with fourth quarter revenue up slightly over the fourth quarter of 2021. Ten-X revenues are expected to trend lower in the first half of 2023 on a sequential and year-over-year basis before recovering in the second half of the year with stronger growth. We expect the lands and businesses for sale marketplaces to continue to deliver strong double-digit growth in 2023. Overall, we expect full year 2023 revenue growth of 10% to 11% in our other marketplaces sector with Q run revenue down in the range of 10% to 13% year-over-year on lower Ten-X transaction revenue expectations. Information Services revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year of 2022 ahead of our 10% guidance. For 2023, we expect first quarter revenue growth of 10% to 12% and full year growth in the range of 7% to 9%. Our sales force totaled approximately 1,130 people at the end of the year, an increase of 300 sales reps over the ending 2021 sales teams levels. We're already seeing strong contributions from our new sellers in the booking results, and we expect this sales investment to produce revenue growth acceleration in 2023 and beyond as they become more productive over time. We intend to continue to selectively grow the sales force in 2023, albeit at a little slower pace than in 2022 with a focus primarily on Apartments.com and LoopNet both of which are expected to benefit from the positive countercyclical effects of lower occupancy levels. Our contract renewal rates remain in the 90% to 91% range that we communicated last quarter, while the renewal rate in the fourth quarter for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer remained strong at 95%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts continues to climb and was 81% for the fourth quarter of 2022, up from 77% in the previous year and up 3 percentage points sequentially from third quarter of 2022. These improvements reflect modest increases in both multifamily and LoopNet and a positive mix effect of winding down some of those unattractive legacy products in the residential sector. So looking ahead to 2023, we expect revenue to range from $2.46 billion to $2.48 billion, an increase of approximately $290 million at the midpoint of the range, implying annual growth rates of 13%. First quarter 2022 revenue is expected to range from $575 million to $580 million representing revenue growth of 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. Now the big question around here is, who's going to reach the $1 billion revenue run rate first? Will it be CoStar or Apartments.com. It's going to be exciting to watch as we get into the second half of the year and down the home stretch into the fourth quarter. With our biggest commercial businesses of CoStar, Apartments.com and LoopNet growing in the strong double digits with bigger sales teams, we expect revenue growth rates to accelerate for our commercial information and marketplace businesses from 13% in 2022 to 15% organic revenue growth in 2023. We plan to operate our commercial businesses in 2023 to deliver similar adjusted EBITDA levels as we achieved in 2022 on a margin perspective in order to provide growth capital for our Homes.com residential marketplace investments. 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $500 million to $520 million, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of approximately 21% for the year. First quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $111 million to $116 million, indicating a margin of 20% at the midpoint. As we move through 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the 20% range during the second and third quarters of 2023 with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve modestly to around 22% to 23%. Included in our 2023 outlook are a number of our most important strategic investments for the future growth of the company. As Andy talked through, we're making significant progress with regards to our Homes.com residential marketplace and we plan to increase our investment levels in 2023. Our investments continue to be focused on product development, content creation and building consumer traffic on Homes.com. Growing our sales force across all of our major businesses is another important area of investment. The majority of the new sales resources in 2022 were added in the middle of the year, the cost of which carries over to 2023 and along with the added investment in new sellers that we plan to add this coming year. We expect a great return on every salesperson and are more than happy to carry the investment at this point ahead of when they become fully productive. Closely aligned with the growth of our sales team is our plan to invest in fresh marketing campaigns in both Apartments.com and LoopNet with so many new sellers. We plan to provide the necessary marketing air cover to generate quality sales leads for our sales team. Finally, with regards to areas of growth investment, we plan to continue our European expansion in order to build the pan-European LoopNet marketplace and increased information content for CoStar expansion. So in summary, I'm very encouraged by the exceptional results we delivered in 2022 at a time when the markets and interest rates and inflation all created a healthy dose of economic volatility. Our team is laser-focused on our most meaningful growth investments while producing strong sustainable profit levels in our established commercial businesses. With the early success and increased momentum in our Homes.com residential marketplace, I remain confident that we are on pace to achieve the long-range targets we set last year of $5 billion in revenue and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the year 2027. So thanks to the entire CoStar team for a fantastic 2022, and I look forward to our next update in a couple of months. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Matt, so we can start the Q&A session. Matt, over to you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
George Tong : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Your guidance assumes significant EBITDA margin contraction this year to 21% at the midpoint. And you touched on some of your growth investment priorities. Can you elaborate on where the bulk of your investments are going, as well as what margins will be this year in your nonresidential businesses and what the path to 40% EBITDA margins by 2027 would look like? .
Scott Wheeler: George, thanks for the question. So yes, we do have a significant investment plan for the year. And as I listed the investments that we're working on in 2023, I listed those in priority and size order. So as you can expect, our investment into residential will be the biggest increase that we will have in 2023. To your question about the commercial businesses, I said we almost reached the 40% margin that we set out for this year, and we expect to continue to deliver that same margin level next year in our commercial business. as we really focus on getting productivity out of our sales resources and the rest of the teams and the commercial side of the business. So we'll be at the about the 21% margin rate next year Interestingly enough, and this wasn't planned that way, but when we made the Apartments.com investment back in 2015, our margins also went to 21% at that point and have moved up nicely since then, and we are in a market with residential that's at least 2 to 3x the size of the Apartments.com opportunity. So I think that gives you a sense of where our focus is for investment and why we think now is the right time to make that investment ahead of the growth that we're going to get up into 2027. We're not providing any margin guidance right now past 2023. So stay tuned as we'll move throughout time. We'll give you more guidance there.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Peter Christiansen: Thanks for the question. Good evening. Nice results. Andy, now that we've moved past move and considering the considerable firepower you still have on the balance sheet. Just trying to think where is your head now as -- and I mean, do you still see opportunities for M&A in the residential side or maybe you're leaving more now towards commercial, the existing segment. Just wondering if you can give us some color on how you're thinking about M&A these days. Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So there are -- as we have been in exploring different opportunities, there have been other opportunities in the wings, and we assess each one for its potential ROI complexity and risk. So there are additional opportunities out there in both commercial and in residential. And we're also looking at that we're also looking at the buy versus build scenario continuously. So you could use a you could use a real estate analogy, you could buy an existing property or you could build a property. And there are different seasons for each where you get a better ROI on one or another. So right now, you can see some of the success we're having in traffic growth. And we see some of the positive feedback we're getting on the approach we're taking to the market. And so we feel that we have a unique offering on the organic side that no one else is offering out there. And so we're a little more focused on that and acquisitions that might support an organic, inorganic -- a more organic strategy on building out the opportunity. It's important to remember that in the residential portal space, the vast majority of residential agents don't buy anything from the leading portals. So I believe that maybe 97% of active residential agents aren't buying anything from the existing portals. And so we think there's a very attractive organic opportunity there. And we think that there are acquisitions that help you reach that goal. And then there are also less directly related acquisition opportunities. So -- it's a changing landscape and you're making judgments as you go and making sure that you believe it's the best ROI for the investors.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Heather Balsky: Just going back to the M&A question. with regards to your balance sheet and you guys are sitting on a lot of cash. I guess if -- it sounds like you're thinking organic, you're thinking organic investment, you're thinking, it sounds like maybe some sort of acquisitions that sound like might be tuck-in or you may do something transformational. I guess, in the meantime, how are you thinking about your balance sheet and the cash sitting on your balance sheet?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Thanks for the question. The continued view of our strategy is to focus on acquisitions and adding meaningful scale to the company through that vehicle, which is why we raised the capital over the last few years. And in the meantime, obviously, we'll try to maximize the returns from the capital that we have. It's helpful that interest rates have gone up to help us a bit with that. And of course, we'll always keep open other alternatives for that capital as time goes on. But that's how we're thinking about our capital still today, and we have many other acquisition opportunities in the pipeline that we hope to deploy that capital against in the near future. .
Heather Balsky: And I apologize, may I just squeeze in what -- in terms of the investment spend for residential in 2023? Okay. Sorry about that.
Scott Wheeler: No, no, no, go ahead. Go ahead.
Heather Balsky: Okay. Just the actual dollar spend, specifically for residential in 2023, would you guys mind sharing that?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. No, we haven't provided that information in 2023. And let me explain, I'm sure everyone is wondering, Matt, that now that we've integrated Homesnap, we've integrated Homes.com. They're all in our combined technology stacks with the rest of the things that Frank Simuro runs in our marketplaces. We also have significant resources in our research team now embedded under Lisa Ruggles, working on residential as well as the research for CoStar Apartments.com, LoopNet. And so as they deploy folks out into the field to do media shoots and other property information, those resources go all across the different property types that we have and they produce information. And so we don't spend the time to go back and track time sheets or record what everyone's working on in a way that would say, hey, we're going to track margins by each of our businesses. And as you know, we have not provided margins by businesses in the past, and we don't intend to do that because of the integrated nature of the business we run. So what we found out this year was that as we go into this more integrated residential strategy that comes a lot of work and difficult to break that out. Now in broad sensors, I think you can get to roughly what that looks like given the commercial growth, the commercial margins, and we do give revenue breakouts by the different businesses. So hopefully, that will allow everyone to get a sense of where we're going. And you can tell how important this residential strategy is to us by the amount we're willing to invest, again, knowing that we've got a phenomenal opportunity in a few years for the revenue to get to that $1 billion or so in residential that we spoke about before.
Andrew Florance: And there is competitive elements here where you don't want to be terribly transparent on every detail, and you want, we believe investors and analysts can figure some of the stuff out, but we don't want to put it in an earnings call script to make it that easy.
Heather Balsky: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Stephen Sheldon: Hey, thanks. So it seems like you're ramping the residential investments pretty heavily this year. And Andy, I think you said that you could start to see some better monetization of content, et cetera, later in 2023. It doesn't seem like you've assumed that really in the residential revenue guidance that you laid out, Scott. So just curious to get some more detail on when you'd expect to see residential monetization really improve? And do you think that 2023 could be the peak drag or disconnect, however you want to frame it between residential revenue and operating expenses.
Andrew Florance: So I believe we met with a number of investors and discussed a point where we begin to do the first levels of monetization at 25 million uniques. And in January, we were at 24 million uniques. So we're a little ahead of our plan there. And so we are focusing on the back half of the year to build out that product or to build out that offering and apply sales resources to it. It would be no way that it would be meaningful revenue in 2023, just because of the timing of the ramp-up. I think that the question of where you see peak investment includes a psychological element to it. So I think where the point at which you are an investor is not yet seeing the first stage of monetization or seeing traffic strategy or unique positioning of a product. From that perspective, I would say that 2023 is probably the peak psychological negative operating margin time period. And we would hope to be showing signs of success of 24, 25. So we've done this a number of times. This is if you use the analogy of building a building and you're building out first year, you're acquiring the land, design the property second year, you're getting the permits, bidding out the work, third year you're building out, if you're leasing it up. We've built a number of buildings just like this before. And so typically, when people see the groundbreaking in year two, three and the buildings start to come up, they can begin to imagine it. And we're still in the early phases. We're near two really of this initiative. But eventually, people get pretty excited because they realize as a digital building and it has a fixed cost, and you can lease it up repeatedly and repeatedly, repeatedly to make a lot of money on it. So I think 2023 is a substantial investment year. I would anticipate that there would be investment in 2024, but with more KPIs that the world could see and appreciate.
Stephen Sheldon: Makes lot of sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tomasello with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi. Thank for taking the question. Switching over to the commercial business. Maybe you can talk about the puts and takes beyond what you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Andy, around the current backdrop, in CRE specifically as it relates to CoStar Suite and LoopNet. I guess for Suite with the step down in growth you're contemplating this year in guidance, is that including any modest headwind from the core broker base in terms of attrition there. And in terms of LoopNet, nice to see the acceleration in growth for 2023, albeit I guess, back-end weighted, but would be helpful to understand what gives you confidence in your ability to execute on the growth initiatives there at LoopNet in this environment, particularly for the significant -- for the owner focused advertising product.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So on the CoStar side, the renewal rates are fantastic. And we are not seeing any sort of friction with brokers in any way, shape or form. You had a bit of a surge with -- you had a bit of a surge there with a global platform sale over the last year. But one of the things we do now is we've got our sales force began to focus on some other initiatives that we think are equally valuable on the lender side, the corporate real estate side and the owner side. So we feel that there's more than ample opportunity to continue that growth rate in CoStar. I think I've made that same comment and been right about it for about 140 earnings calls. And on the LoopNet side, we're at a really important junction there where we are actually building up a sales force that is capable of going after this opportunity at a national level, first time we've ever had a dedicated sales force for LoopNet at that level. We did an extensive set of focus groups earlier this earlier very tail end of last year, and we spoke with our market researchers, collective information from owners, from brokers and from corporate real estate users. One of the things that really was impactful was 10 for 10, all the Fortune 1000 real estate folks we were talking to we're using the heck out of LoopNet to select and find their facilities, which leads me to believe that LoopNet is the single most important marketing vehicle in commercial real estate. And in that context in a game -- and not a game in a situation where, in some sectors, particularly say, office, it's a game of musical chairs where the person with the tenant wins big and that person without a tenant is handing the keys back to the bank. I believe that there is smart people would invest in digital marketing campaigns to give themselves the best shot at filling up their properties in a tough environment. So one, building it up by individual rep by rep performance. It gives us the outlook that we think makes sense. And two, just looking at the market conditions and how LoopNet is optimally positioned to help people with very valuable assets with relatively minor investments in digital marketing. It's me talking, which I'm skewed, but when I see a broker or an owner with a significant leasing problem that may cause them to hand back their keys and they failed to market it on LoopNet I am just gobsmacked at what a stupid move that is. So I believe that, again, from listening to hundred hours of focus groups, I believe we've got a winner of a product and executing building a sales force to go after that opportunity and marketing that opportunity will allow us to continue and accelerate the growth rate that you're already seeing us accelerate. Do I sound confident? Do I think -- does it sound like my child is handsome?
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for [indiscernible]
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Meuler: Yes. Thank you. I know you don't have like formal subsegments or product level margins. But the 39% flattish margins for nonresi, I just want to confirm that, that includes the investment in sales force as well as Apartments.com and LoopNet marketing and other initiatives. And then, so that's just the first part. And then second, can you help us with the Q1 margin guidance? Is that the Apartments.com marketing? Or are you starting to market Homes.com significantly more aggressively this early in the year as well?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. So Jeff, to the first part of your question, the margins I referenced on the commercial information marketplace businesses. Yes, includes CoStar, LoopNet Apartments.com, all of the investments that we make in those platforms. So it's everything outside of the residential marketplace. And then I think more notably in the first quarter of the year is the hiring that we did in the second half of the year, last year, along with the increases we give for wages in the first quarter, which we do want to keep our employee base ahead of inflation. It's more of those impacts that roll into the first quarter as opposed to any acceleration of marketing spend across the company in general. So that's what we're seeing -- and then we -- like I mentioned before, we won't be hiring as many of those sales forces this year or other resources that will moderate that increase, flatten it out as we go through the year.
Jeffrey Meuler: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens. Your line is now open.
John Campbell: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank for squeezing in my question. Just sticking on the M&A conversation. Andy, when you talk about the build versus buy, is it safe to assume that you're now, I guess, fully committed to building the traffic based on an organic basis versus acquiring it? Or should we not necessarily roll that out with it maybe just coming down to whether you can get the right price for the right asset?
Andrew Florance: I don't think you can rule anything out like it's a flexible thing. And I think you described it accurately. I think we are fortunate to have a very viable organic path. And again, there are -- there are many, I would say, going into this year or going into the fall, it felt almost sometimes if there were too many M&A opportunities out there. So there are a number of things. But as you know, we're not at liberty to discuss these kinds of things typically in detail.
John Campbell: Understood. Thanks, Andy.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is now open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just had a broader question about the guidance and the conservatism that's baked in. Last year, we saw a pretty like expectation for a pretty upfront resi investment, and we saw numbers being beaten and raised as we went through the quarters. Is that something similar this year as well where we have taken some conservatism around these growth investments? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, I appreciate the question. As we really started to make progress into our investments last year, we gave a much broader range of outcomes when we the year, I think our EBITDA range was $40 million, which when you look back in time, we've never really provided that kind of range. It sort of spoke a little bit to the uncertainty that we had coming into last year when we were really initiating some of our uptick in the investments, particularly around content and other parts that we were focused on. So fortunately, we were able to spend less in those areas. And I think what you saw this year is that we've tightened up the range that we go out for the beginning of the year, which would let you know that we have a little bit better line of sight the progress we're making. We're a year further into it, we can gauge our investments more. But that being said, the marketplace changes quarter-to-quarter, and we see the opportunities or the challenges and we'll adjust appropriately, and we're always looking for where do we minimize investment at the right time so that we are building at pace, but not spending too much, but then when it does come to the point where we launch products and we see ramp-ups in revenue, and it's time to put in more investments, then we definitely include some of those in our forecasting. So I think -- I think we have a better line of sight this year. But as you would expect in the early stages and in an investment cycle, you have to be ready for changes along the way. I hope that provides you a little bit of guidance there.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Participant: Hi. Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Recognizing, Andy, that the company has a very good track record, as you pointed out, of identifying big opportunities, investing against them and putting up outsized revenue growth and in light of the fact that you're asking investors to sort of stomach another year of down margins as you do that in residential. Can you maybe give us a little bit of a sneak peak of what you think the business looks like on the other side? Can this be as you start to monetize residential, should we think about this being a mid-teens organic revenue growth business? Are there some trade-offs? I recognize you have these 27 targets out there. Just sort of wondering kind of what a post investment in CoStar growth profile looks like?
Andrew Florance: Well, I think Apartments.com probably gives you a good view of what that would look like. It is -- it is something that has, I believe, like post establishing a platform with a unique value proposition and a significant presence I think that you have multiple decades of growth that follows on that and there's ample precedent for that around the world and also in Apartments.com and CoStar and LoopNet. So it definitely is a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity. And in my mind, it is a north of $1 billion EBITDA opportunity. And it is obviously a multitrillion dollar sales market, it is a vast opportunity. So it does take investment to build out the platform as it took investment to build out the CoStar platform as it took investment to build out the LoopNet platform as it took investment to build out the apartments platform. But the other side of it, you get predictable high-margin growth for decades, similar to building a building. So -- but not similar to build and building because you never lease up. You can just keep selling more and more of it once you get there. So yes, and I would say that we're further into the process. Our confidence in the clarity grows a little bit, which leads to some of our positioning today.
Unidentified Participant: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Silber: Thanks so much. You talked about moderating the hiring of sales force, but you're still going to make some investments. I'm just curious, given what's going on in the market, especially in the real estate area. Is it easier to find salespeople than it was maybe six to 12 months ago?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, I would think so. Yes, we -- on a number of elements. One is that we've been through a large hiring stage. And so our own processes and ability to identify the right candidates has increased. I think the candidate pools that are seeing tightening up in other sectors and reductions in staff and other sectors are helping us find good quality candidates. And anyone that's selling digital products can be effective for our sales forces on the information side. And then, we're getting better at not only the Canada identification, but then the onboarding and the training and the coaching as we bring in these cohorts. So starting from the market side, all the way through the pipeline, it's getting easier. And so adding another, let's say, 100 folks in 2023 versus the 300 we added last year seems like a layup for us now, but there's still a lot of work to do to onboard and make sure all of the 300 are getting to be productive and contributing members to that strong revenue growth and then to replace the ones that inevitably, there are some that won't be able to pass that hurdle and we'll know that within about six months and then we replace and move on. We're definitely in a place where we can be selective, and we definitely are a place where we're able to meet our hiring goals. And it's not just on the sales side, it's in the software development side. It's in the research side. It's in -- throughout the company, we're seeing it's much easier to hire now. At the same time, we're retaining people simultaneously. So that's a good place to be in because we are able to put together the absolute highest quality team that you'd want to put together with the ability to hire and the ability to retain right now.
Jeffrey Silber: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Stephanie Moore: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for the question. I wanted to actually just -- I wanted to touch on – it might be helpful to hear what you're seeing maybe from some of your end customers, what you're seeing in terms of customer sales cycles, if that has changed at all as the year progressed and into this year. Thanks.
Andrew Florance: I think that the sales cycle in Apartments.com has gotten faster as the markets eroded. I think that the sales cycle and CoStar is a mix because you're selling to so many different sectors when you're selling into lenders or to big corporate users, that tends to be a more deliberate longer sales cycle process. The ownership side is similar on the LoopNet side. I think that it's not so much about sales cycle. It's more about it takes about six to nine months before the LoopNet salespeople really get their sea legs and understand digital marketing and commercial real estate. So it's more of a ramp-up thing, but the sales cycle itself in that -- in LoopNet, I think, is pretty fast. So we're not seeing anything in the -- the only place we're seeing something change fundamentally in sales cycle as apartments and it's shortening.
Stephanie Moore: Understood. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Joe Goodwin with JMP. Your line is now open.
Joe Goodwin: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I guess, Andy, when you set up investment in Apartments.com in 2015, that business was at a larger scale than the residential business is today. It took you around six, seven years to get to north of $700 million in revenue for apartments. Your 2027 target calls for at least $700 million of residential revenue on an organic basis, I believe. So I guess just other than the residential market being larger, what are some of the other elements or factors in the residential market that gives you the confidence that the residential business will effectively outperform farmers.com business?
Andrew Florance: Sure. So the market -- the revenue was actually roughly the same, the revenue in place that we had. So I think I don't know 75 -- were roughly 75 last year. So it was roughly the same revenue. The market itself in residential is dramatically larger. Also, our experience with operating digital marketplaces has continued to grow and the number of resources we have to bring to bear in both sales talent, SEO, SEM marketing, software development, the whole range is broader. Also, I believe there is some level of synergy across these platforms. So because you have a strong presence in apartments or LoopNet, there is or land or in any of these areas, there is -- there's a little bit of an accelerating effect across the platforms. But I would say I would go back, one of the things is that people forget, but that in -- with Apartments.com, there was a lot of competition that was better established than we were. So there were 4 or 5 players from Craigs list to Zillow to apartment guide to Rent.com to for rent to apartment finder all bigger than us that we were competing up against. And back then, when you looked around at apartment communities, most we're buying from one or more or several of these different players. There's something very different happening in residential real estate, which is the vast majority of players in residential real estate aren't buying from any of the of the established larger residential portals. The vast majority of people aren't buying anything from them. Our number one competition in my mind is the United States Postal Service. So I feel very comfortable competing against the United States postal surface. In fact, I don't know what your mailbox looks like, but about the last thing in my mailbox is residential ads. So I collect them all from every place have a mailbox and I bring them all and I throw them at a conference table in our office here in the product design studio. Just as a reminder of how much money residential real estate is spending on marketing properties very little of it with who you would consider to be the entrenched real estate portals.
Joe Goodwin: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. So I will turn it back to Andy to wrap up.
Andrew Florance: Okay. Well, I appreciate everyone joining us for this fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. We're -- in 2023, we expect to deliver accelerating revenue growth and strong margins, very strong margins in the commercial business. while continuing our careful, thoughtful, responsible investment into the residential market opportunity. The strong performance of our core commercial real estate products support that contained investment into Homes.com. And back -- going back to the analogy of 2015, we invested tens of millions of dollars into marketing Apartments.com, and that brought our margin down a little bit. But today, that business has become a multibillion-dollar asset for our shareholders with an incredibly attractive ROI, not dissimilar to what the investments we made in CoStar and the incredible ROI there. So we believe that our focus and investment in the residential sector will yield an equally attractive, if not superior return through time. So we look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter call on April 25 at 5:00 Eastern Center time until then, stay safe. And thank you very much for participating in the call, except for the competitors listening.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-25 17:00:00) =====

Andrew Florance: Thank you, Cyndi. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This is our 97th consecutive earnings call.  Total revenue for the third quarter grew 13% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $557 million, coming in at the high end of our guidance range and above consensus estimates. We delivered exceptional results in the third quarter with annualized net new sales bookings of $76 million, a 62% increase over the same quarter in 2021. This is our second highest quarterly net sales bookings number ever.  Adjusted EBITDA was $153 million for the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and consensus estimates. As a result, we're raising our full year outlook for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA.  Apartments.com surged, turning in the highest sales month ever in September and its second highest sales quarter. Year-to-date, net new sales for Apartments.com are up 192% over the prior year. Apartments.com revenues were $190 million in the third quarter, increasing 11% over the third quarter of '21. We are now back to double-digit revenue growth and expect the growth rate to improve in the fourth quarter.  Tight multifamily market conditions have been a headwind for Apartments.com, but are now shifting and may, in fact, become a strong tailwind. Vacancy rates rose to 6.1% in the third quarter, an increase of 40 basis points from the last quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarterly increase in the vacancy rate, and we are now only 40 basis points below the historical long-term average vacancy rate.  Unit absorption rates dropped to 52,000 units in the third quarter from 67,000 units in the second quarter. This is the lowest absorption rate in the past 11 quarters. At the same time, though, unit deliveries increased from the second quarter to $122,000, which is at the higher end of historical averages. With the number of units under construction nearing all-time highs and absorption moving towards all-time lows, vacancies are expected to rise further in the coming quarters, which we believe will increase the demand for advertising. The Apartments.com sales force delivered absolutely outstanding results in the third quarter. Good work, Paige and team.  Our gross sales productivity per rep was 91% versus the same quarter last year, reaching an all-time high. With 60,000 apartment buildings on the platform, we have now reached an all-time high for participation. Given that we are still very early with relatively low market penetration in this opportunity, we continue to hire aggressively and have increased the sales force by 26% since the end of last year. We plan to continue growing the team over the next year or so until we have doubled the sales force.  Our nationwide ad campaign has delivered over 12 billion media impressions and led to an all-time high in consumer brand awareness. Apartments.com continues to provide the highest quality consumer traffic to our customers. We believe that a specific purpose sites such as Apartments.com delivers higher intense leads. We also believe that third-party lead analysis shows that our leads convert to leases at significantly higher rates than any of our competitors. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong performance of Apartments.com marketplace and sales team and have increasing confidence in our ability to return to 20% revenue growth.  Revenue for CoStar was $213 million in the third quarter, representing a 17% increase over the same quarter a year ago on a constant currency basis. CoStar sales results increased 55% in the trailing 12 months compared to the trailing 12-month sales in the same quarter a year ago. We surpassed 180,000 subscribers in the third quarter and continue to maintain high renewal rates at 93%.  Our consistent double-digit revenue growth and high renewal rates for CoStar are a result of ongoing product investments that broaden the capabilities of CoStar and allow us to reach new customers. Integrating STR hotel data opened up hospitality investors as customers, while our new lender product to make 6,000 medium and large lending institutions, great prospects to become customers. We literally have dozens of major potential product enhancements on our product road map, which will continue to deliver revenue growth opportunities for the next decade or more.  The next product enhancement on the CoStar roadmap involves adding information on 12,600 commercial property investment funds that invest almost $3.6 trillion in commercial properties around the world. These investment funds hold over 70,000 commercial properties. Over the past year, our research team has been linking the investment fund's property information to properties in CoStar and adding properties in countries that are currently not in our data sets. Approximately 70% of the investment fund properties are in the United States, Canada and the U.K., while the remaining 30% expand our property coverage throughout the rest of the world.  For the first time, these fund investors will have new detailed analytics on their property portfolios through CoStar. They'll be able to access information like historic sales comps, leasing history, pricing, vacancy rates and other important details to help understand their portfolios better. In addition, brokers and owners looking to sell properties will be able to clear the investment fund data to determine which funds still have dry powder and are looking to invest in properties that are similar to theirs.  I believe this new investment fund capability unlocks significant potential revenue opportunity. The investment on product is scheduled to release in CoStar in the first quarter of 2023. We believe that there is significantly more revenue opportunity ahead for CoStar, so we're continuing to grow our CoStar sales force to better capture that opportunity. We've added over 50 new sellers so far this year and plan to continue to expand both in the U.S. and internationally. As we add to our sales teams, we've seen productivity levels increase as well.  Average gross sales per rep are higher this year than in any single quarter in the past 5 years. With our strong product development capabilities and continued investments in our sales team, I'm confident in our ability to sustain strong double-digit growth in CoStar for many years.  LoopNet third quarter revenue was $59 million, up 13% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. Net new sales bookings for LoopNet in the third quarter are up 99% over the third quarter of last year. Just 1 percentage point shy of being up 100% year-over-year. We'll try harder next time.  Our sales team is now producing consistent, strong sales results every month. Over the past 6 months, we've produced more net sales bookings than we did in all of 2021. I'm very encouraged by the progress that Dave Male and his team are making as we grow our dedicated LoopNet sales force, which is now 3x the size it was from the beginning of the year. We have now surpassed 100 dedicated sales reps.  The result is that dedicated LoopNet sellers now account for roughly half of all the LoopNet sales, and the CoStar sales force is delivering the other half. This is an improvement from a year ago when our dedicated LoopNet sales team produced roughly 1/3 of LoopNet sales. In the long term, we want to free up the CoStar sales force to focus more effort on CoStar as it approaches $1 billion in revenue.  Traffic to our LoopNet network of sites reached a high in the third quarter, averaging approximately 13 million unique visitors per month. We now hold the #1 keyword rank across 130,000 commercial real estate search terms and sort to the #1 position 97% of the time across 10,000 of the highest-performing U.S. commercial real estate search terms.  Our Space for Dreams media campaign has proven very successful, delivering over 200 million impressions across TV, social media and the web in the third quarter. We continue to expand LoopNet internationally with plans to launch loopnet.co.uk across the United Kingdom in early November. Following our successful launch of LoopNet in Canada in the first quarter, we believe there is significant brand efficiency, revenue, profit advantages in operating a multinational property marketplace.  We estimate the potential revenue for digital commercial property advertising in the U.K. to be well north of $100 million, which up to this point is largely untapped. Loopnet.co.uk will bring together the market-leading traffic position of Realla, with a proven international LoopNet brand. We intend to redirect traffic from Realla to LoopNet and sunset Realla. It's been a very successful site.  As our CoStar clients in the U.K. are renewing their annual CoStar contracts, our sales force is working with them to add LoopNet advertising to their service. Today, many of the listings on Realla have been free in order to build traffic, but our goal is to convert many to pay on LoopNet over the course of the next 18 months.  Following the launch of LoopNet in the U.K., we'll turn our attention to rolling out LoopNet in France, Spain and Germany in 2023. We're really excited to deliver the first multinational commercial real estate marketplaces, and we believe it will have huge appeal. We believe that the LoopNet opportunity is in excess of $1 billion as we extend across Europe.  Our Ten-X digital auction platform performed very well in the third quarter despite a significant slowdown in overall CRE sales volumes due to the disruption caused by surging inflation and the rapid increase in interest rates. While CRE transactions were down in the market by almost $30 billion in the third quarter, the volume of properties brought to the Ten-X platform increased 88% over the prior year.  Consistent with prior quarters, over 80% of the assets brought to the platform through Ten-X are still market rate performing assets, and less than 20% of the assets are distressed properties. I expect a significant increase in distressed properties in the quarters to come.  Clearly, the commercial property transaction market is in a period of disruption, with buyer and seller expectations not yet on the same page. Buyers are quick to recognize price drops, but sellers are slower to accept reality. The result is an overall drop in sales volume across the board. As expected, we are seeing a drop in the rate that properties brought to the platform actually end up selling, what we call the trade rate. The Ten-X trade rates rose to highs of 75% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and have since dropped 27% to around 55%. Nevertheless, Ten-X continues to be a more effective way to sell properties, because in the same time period, we saw traditional off-line trades dropped from 42% from a 43% trade rate to a 55% trade rate.  The Ten-X platform trade rate went from outperforming off-line sales by 74% in a stable market to outperforming off-line sales by 120% in a dislocated market. We believe the buyer-seller dislocation is a near-term event that will resolve itself over the next 2 to 3 quarters. Generally, once buyer and seller's expectations align again, sales volumes increase and distressed sales grow significantly. Currently, distressed sales rates are at multiyear lows, but believe they will significantly climb in the intermediate term.  In 2008, the year of significant economic dislocation, there were only about 2,900 distressed commercial property sales, and distressed sales took years to peak with about 16,000 distressed sales in 2012. Year-to-date, similar to 2008, there's only been about 2,178 distressed sales. I would not be surprised if the number of distressed property sales quadrupled over the next few years, creating significant revenue opportunity for Ten-X.  We've made a major investment to integrate Ten-X into CoStar and LoopNet, and we have dramatically increased the size of the Ten-X sales force. In the next few months, we'll complete all those integration efforts of Ten-X, enabling significant scale efficiencies. I believe the platform has never been stronger and is ready to handle a surge in activity.  Regardless of where we are with the economic cycles, we're building Ten-X for the long term. I'm confident our Ten-X digital platform will become the industry standard for fast, efficient property transactions, both for performing and distressed assets. Regardless of the economic cycle, Ten-X will be ready.  Our residential business continues to perform well, with third quarter revenue of $19 million. Registered agents for our Homesnap Pro and Pro+ products have grown to over 958,000 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 23% over the same quarter last year. We're getting close to 1 million registered agents.  Registered agents for Citysnap are also growing rapidly. We now have approximately 70% of the Real Estate Board of New York agents registered to use Citysnap, and we only launched the product a little over 3 months ago. Traffic to Homes.com continues to grow, with average monthly unique visitors for the third quarter, up 52% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Site visits to Homes.com were up 83% of the same period last year according to Google Analytics. The greater increase of visits to visitors shows deeper engagement with the site.  I'm encouraged by the rapid improvement in consumer traffic. We do have a long way to go, but we're tracking just where we were with traffic growth on Apartments.com at the same time. And Apartments.com was a very successful launch. According to ComScore, September 2022 over September 2021, Homes.com visits grew 27%, while in the same time period, Zillow fell 22% and Realtor fell 30%.  As we communicated before in previous earnings calls, our residential product strategy is centered around a Homes.com marketplace that advertises the home as opposed to just advertising agents. We believe consumers that search for properties for sale in a marketplace like Homes.com have higher intent to consumers who are served home-for-sale ads randomly across social media or the Internet. Our objective is to partner with the 1.5 million agents in the United States in support of your listing your lead approach and enable consumers at any agent to collaborate digitally throughout the home buying or selling process.  We're focused on building complete coverage of residential listings throughout the United States, as well as developing unique proprietary content by leveraging the skills and capabilities of our awesome nationwide research organization. Overall, we're making great progress developing Homes.com across all these strategic areas, and are looking forward to showcasing a number of our agent-focused product features at the upcoming National Association of Realtors Convention in early November. In fact, I believe we have a big product release Thursday or Friday of this week, if you want to check out some of the incremental upgrades at the end of the week.  With rising interest rates and a rapidly cooling residential property market, I believe now is the perfect time to invest in a marketplace that's designed to help consumers and their agents advertise and sell properties faster and at a higher price. Deteriorating market conditions may well create a tailwind for our business model.  The majority of Homesnap's revenue is from reselling social media and search engine advertising to agents. We believe that this revenue, while it's good revenue, is less strategic, less durable and just playing less of it than the potential revenue generated by a potentially successful high-intent marketplace like Homes.com. This is a lesson we've learned from our experience with Apartments.com for rent, LoopNet and other marketplaces we operate.  In the coming quarters, we're going to deemphasize selling Homesnap concierge and Homesnap Pro+ and temporarily shift those selling resources to our marketplaces, Apartments.com and LoopNet. Our sales teams will gain new skills and become even more well-rounded sellers across multiple marketplaces. After a brief transition period, we believe that we will generate more revenue overall with a shift in sales force allocation. As we have communicated previously, when we have built critical traffic mass for Homes.com we will then reallocate or allocate significant selling resources to Homes.com.  There is a potentially interesting development in the residential industry I want to briefly mention. We're closely monitoring ongoing antitrust litigation involving residential listing associations, or MLSs, and 1 that's currently pending in the Western District of Missouri. A class of home sellers allege that NAR and brokerage [indiscernible] created enforced anti-competitive rules that require home sellers to pay a nonnegotiable commission to the broker representing the home buyer, resulting in inflated buyer-side brokerage commissions.  To date, the planners have had some success to feeding a motion to dismiss and succeeding class certification. The case is scheduled for trial in February. If the plaintiffs in this case or other similar cases succeed, this could have a significant adverse effect on residential marketplaces that rely primarily on broker sharing commission revenue models.  Our residential sales strategy should not be impacted as we are focused on a property advertising model. I do not believe that judgment for the plans would significantly adversely impact most residential agents because most do both seller and buyer representation, and the judgment would just shift fees from the buyer representation business to the seller representation business. More on that in February.  The rise in interest rates over the past 7 months is certainly weighing on real estate driving prices down and reducing sales volumes. The slowdown has been broad-based across property types and geographies. Office vacancy rates continue to climb as companies continue to recover from the pandemic. And a significant number, but minority of workers continue to work from home. In the third quarter, vacancy rates rose to 12.4%, and that's approaching historic highs.  Inflation-adjusted rents are well below normal levels and rent growth is at a 10-year low. Net absorption has been negative for 7 of the last 10 quarters. Office vacancy will continue to rise and rents will continue to likely experience negative pressure. However, each quarter, millions more office workers are returning to working in person because of the significant advantages of in-person collaboration.  According to [indiscernible] security in January of this year, usage of office space was only about 16% of the prepandemic levels. But by last week, office usage had tripled this year to 49%. So from 16% at the beginning of the year to 49% now. That's a pretty fast climb. The trend is obvious. Traditional office using white collar employment is continuing to grow, which means there's more underlying demand. And as more and more people return to the workplace, but new office construction starts are very, very low. This suggests that while we're -- while in the short term, the office market will be very soft and there may be significant distress, there may be a significant rebound 2 to 3 years out. I believe that CoStar, LoopNet and Ten-X can function very well in this sort of volatile economic environment.  The story of the industrial sector is very different. Industrial vacancy fell to 3.9% in the second quarter, the lowest rate seen in the sector's history, but ticked higher in the third quarter as developers responded to robust demand. New completions expected in 2023 exceed any annual amount delivered in the last 30 years. Despite these numbers, the sector remains remarkably healthy.  Net absorption in the retail sector drifted lower in the third quarter, although slowing demand has outpaced new supply for 6 consecutive quarters, leading to the third quarter vacancy of 4.3%, the lowest retail vacancy rate recorded. Tight vacancies have given rise to some of the strongest rent growth in history, with the third quarter nominal rent growth of 4.5%.  As the Federal Reserve battles inflation, mortgage rates are rising to their highest level in years. Combined with double-digit home price gains over the past 2 years, affordability has deteriorated to levels not seen in more than 30 years. With buyers being priced out of the market, home sales are tumbling and prices are falling.  Despite the market uncertainty, I believe CoStar is well positioned to sustain our revenue growth and profit through a potential economic cycle. We have proven to be very resilient in previous downturns, which I believe is a direct result of our diversified product mix, low customer concentrations, mission-critical products and a strong predictable subscription model.  We have a loyal and exceptional team of leaders and employees working together in our offices, resulting in the best employee retention rates we've seen in years, if not decades. We're expanding our sales capabilities and geographic reach, unlocking new customer segments and revenue opportunities. Our balance sheet has never been stronger, and we view a downturn as the perfect time to go shopping.  More than 3 decades ago, while I was still a college student, I founded CoStar in a dorm room with an ambitious vision of digitizing the world's real estate. That first year, we realized a poultry revenue of $7,000. But CoStar was in the right place at the right time. There is almost $200 trillion of real estate in the world, and leading that effort to digitize it can unlock massive value. This mission has drawn a margin of investors and energized colleagues who brought life to the vision. Year-by-year, decade-by-decade, we've consistently and persistently grown those poultry revenues into the impressive billions.  This quarter, we achieved an accomplishment almost no company ever achieves, we made the S&P 500. We're also proud and grateful to be here. We're here because of a remarkable group of colleagues who are committed to this mission of digitizing the world's real estate, empowering all people to discover properties, insights and connections, all of which improve people's businesses and lives. Going forward, we are now single mindly focused on reaching the S&P 100.  At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I sounded great today. I'm not sure if it's the microphone, but I hope you're in as good a voice in the Q&A session. Well, third quarter certainly was another great quarter, a great way to start our first earnings release in the S&P 500. I definitely agree, we're well positioned strategically and financially regardless of economic volatility and the external market conditions. Certainly encouraged by our strong performance across all of the information and marketplace products in our portfolio.  Let's start with CoStar as the product revenue grew 17% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter and 16% in total after considering the devaluation of the British pound. Over half of our revenue growth in CoStar is from new customers, which speaks to the success of the new product introductions that Andy talked about. CoStar product revenue has grown at least 15% every quarter this year, and we expect 15% revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter, which is 16% on a constant currency basis.  Multifamily revenue growth in the third quarter was 11%. The number of properties on our platform is growing, and we also see positive underlying trends in our ad sales mix. Customers upgrading to higher value ad packages is once again outpacing the value of properties downgrading to lower-priced ads. With strong sales momentum and an improving economic backdrop for advertising on Apartments.com, we now expect multifamily revenue growth of 16% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year of 2022.  LoopNet revenue grew 13% in the third quarter on a constant currency basis, in line with our guidance expectations. We expect fourth quarter revenue to grow, to trend similarly to the third quarter at 12% to 13%, with full year revenue growth of 11% to 12%. Revenue from Information Services grew 14% in the third quarter, ahead of our 11% guidance estimate on revenue, primarily as a result of STR revenue favorability. Both Real Estate Manager and STR each grew double digits in the third quarter. We expect full year 2022 revenue growth of 10% in information services, unchanged from our prior guidance.  Residential revenue decreased 22% overall for the third quarter of last year as expected due to the runoff of the acquired nonstrategic revenue from Homes.com. On an organic basis, excluding Homes.com, revenue grew 13% in the third quarter. Subscription revenue grew 44%. Our expectation for full year 2022 residential revenue remains unchanged at $73 million.  During the third quarter, we made a strategic decision to eliminate certain usage fees related to agent access to the Homesnap Pro application. The Pro version of the Homesnap application is now free to all agents in our multiple listing service network. As a result, we accelerated $16 million of amortization in the third quarter for intangible assets that were recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the Homesnap acquisition.  Other marketplaces revenue grew 12% in the third quarter of 2022, led by continued strength in our lands and business for sale marketplaces. Ten-X revenue growth slowed in Q3 as a result of the market dislocation that Andy discussed. We adjusted our Ten-X fourth quarter forecast to reflect a continuation of this trend. As a result, we now expect revenue growth in our other marketplaces sector to be 10% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year of 2022.  Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $153 million, exceeding the high end of our third quarter guidance range by $13 million. Total costs in the third quarter were lower than our forecast as a result of investment spending levels in our residential products. We are leveraging more of our existing internal research teams to build out our content, resulting in higher quality content. We are now hiring full-time residential research teams, not contractors, which results in lower investment spending levels this year.  Our marketing investment was also lower than our forecast in the third quarter, a trend we expect to continue through the end of the year due to our strong traffic. Our revised estimate for the incremental 2022 residential investment spending is now in the $125 million range compared to the $180 million to $200 million previously communicated.  Our sales force has eclipsed 1,000 sellers for the first time, totaling 1,090 salespeople at the end of the third quarter. We added a total of 115 sales reps in the third quarter, which is the second consecutive quarter growing sales headcount by more than 100 people. Year-to-date, our sales team has grown 32% compared to the beginning of 2022, with Apartments.com, LoopNet and CoStar increasing the most in terms of total heads added. We expect to add a net 300 sales heads in 2022.  Although it takes 12 to 18 months to get a return on a new salesperson, when fully productive, these 300 new sellers can produce approximately $70 million to $80 million in subscription revenue every year, and this is revenue that renews at over 90%. Over 5 years, this has the potential to generate almost 500% return on the cost of this investment. Clearly, from a financial perspective, the faster we can grow our sales distribution channel against a market that is worth tens of billions of dollars, the better off we will be.  Our contract renewal rate was 90% in the third quarter of 2022, slightly below the 91% renewal rate in the second quarter of 2022. This is a trailing 12-month metric that has fluctuated between 90% and 91% over the past 3 quarters, anchored by CoStar at 93% and multifamily at 90% in the third quarter.  Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 79% for the third quarter of 2022, 4 percentage points higher than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting the strong recovery in Apartments.com this year.  Turning to the outlook. We expect full year 2022 revenue to range from $2.175 billion to $2.18 billion, which represents an increase at the midpoint of the range by $5 million and implies an annual growth rate of 12% at the midpoint. Organic constant currency growth is expected to be 13%. We expect fourth quarter revenue to range from $566 million to $571 million, representing revenue growth of 12% to 13%.  2022 full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $665 million to $670 million, which is an increase of $48 million from our previous guidance at the midpoint. This increase is a result of efficiencies realized in our residential investment program in both content generation, resourcing and marketing spend.  Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $176 million to $181 million, indicating a margin of 31% at the midpoint. Overall, we're in a very strong position financially as we move through the final months of 2022. We are on track to exceed the growth and profitability targets we set for the business back in February. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and provides us a significant amount of funding flexibility to pursue our long-term growth strategies.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Cyndi.
Cyndi Eakin: I'm actually going to turn it back over to the conference operator, so they can introduce the question.
Scott Wheeler: Sounds like a plan. Over to you, Bailey.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Peter C. Christiansen from Citigroup.
Peter Christiansen: And congrats guys on inclusion in the S&P, that's great. I got to ask the question. Any preliminary thoughts on investment spending for '23 for residential? Any sense of outpacing there would be helpful.
Scott Wheeler: Thanks, Pete. Good to hear from you. So yes, you noticed that we've been much more efficient this year on the residential investment spend. So I think that's good news. The other good news is it doesn't mean that all of that spending gets pushed into next year, because like I said, we have a lot more efficiency in the content generation, and we don't need to spend as much marketing for the traffic we're getting.  So we're not yet ready to give guidance on to the 2023 investment levels. We're working on those now. But we will keep you posted, and be confident that we are still on track to our 5-year numbers that we communicated previously on both the residential and the long-term growth and profitability of the business.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of Jeffrey Meuler from Baird.
Jeffrey Meuler: So just on net bookings, obviously, up big year-over-year. I think it's typically seasonally weaker in Q3 than Q2, which was the case this quarter. But normally, I think that's due to apartments, and apartments it sounds like had a record sales month in September. So if you could just kind of like help reconcile what drove the sequential decline. And if you think the record sales in what is typically not the seasonally strongest month is the reflection of kind of the end market trends picking up with net absorption and builds and all of those stats to give us.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So it's a question of we're growing the apartment sales team. The sales force departments are at the highest productivity levels we've ever seen in any sales force across the company. We have been doing a better job at managing our price per lead and keeping that number fair for both us and our clients. And just the quality of our traffic and the strength of the platform has remained strong. So we're moving up to some really impressive production numbers. Scott, do you want to add anything there?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Jeff, there was 1 other issue that I talked about briefly around the fees for the subscriptions on some of the home Pro access that triggered the $16 million write-off I mentioned. That comes out of the sales numbers. If we had not done that strategic decision, our sales would have been over $80 million for the quarter. And any other variation relative to the second quarter is really just normal quarterly fluctuation amongst the other businesses.  But really the standout, as we pointed out, was that apartments for really the first time had a third quarter that was stronger than the second, which is a great testament to both the sales team and the momentum we're seeing back in the apartments advertising space. When we acquired Apartments.com, third quarter used to be no growth and fourth quarter used to be a decline. So it's great to see it same records in the third quarter.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of Ryan Tomasello from Stifel.
Ryan Tomasello: I guess it'd be helpful if you could provide an update on how you're thinking about the residential site traffic milestones that you've laid out previously. Have those changed at all in terms of the magnitude and timing? And how are you prioritizing the different levers there in terms of marketing campaigns, SEO and SEM and any other levers that you outlined previously?  And then from there, if you have any updated thoughts on the timing of the monetization strategy, when you decide to turn that on and what products you might intend to lean into first?
Andrew Florance: Sure. So I believe that we are on target, on plan for growing that traffic and are comfortable with the sort of $25 million, $50 million traffic levels we had laid out, unique visitor levels we have laid out. And yesterday, I was looking at a traffic chart that compared Apartments.com and Homes.com in the first 18 months after we began rebuilding them, and they matched perfectly. So the growth we're seeing right now is on target, but it's still early days. We just did a major switch over about a month ago. And we're seeing Google crawl the site at a great rate, which is good to see.  But it's a marathon, not a sprint, not a 5k, not a 10k, it's a marathon. And we just continue to layer -- bring layer and layer in to try to grow that traffic on SEO functionality, referrals and the like. I am encouraged by the fact that we are seeing the average number of visits to visitor go up significantly. That's telling me that people coming to the site are like in the experience, the fact that we have a fast performing site, the fact that we're actually showing who actually has the listing. That's uncluttered and it's clean.  Now we are not going to -- we're really focusing on the content, the quality of the experience and SEO. At this point, we are investing in SEM, but we're not investing aggressively in SEM. We're also not investing aggressively in consumer marketing. We are going to begin to ratchet up those levers once we are satisfied that we will have the optimal ROI for that investment based on the number of the sets of functionality we've delivered, the effectiveness of the SEO, the site performance.  So that will likely begin to ramp up going into '23. But we're on target for where we expect to be. And I look forward to another one of our incremental releases on the product coming out later this week.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of John Campbell from Stephens.
John Campbell: Congrats on the continued momentum. I just wanted to revisit Ten-X. I mean, it does seem like there's a pretty meaningful revenue opportunity there, just, I guess, with rising distressed activity. On my math, I'm getting you guys kind of near $70 million or so of Ten-X, but I'm curious about kind of how to size up that opportunity over time. I think nationally, I think the distressed level is still like way less than 5% of the mix. If that gets back to, I don't know, like 10% or 25% or so of kind of the range we saw in 2012, like 2014, what could that look like for Ten-X? And then maybe as a side question there, maybe if you could provide what Ten-X kind of peaked out on revenue during kind of the heart of the crisis.
Scott Wheeler: Do you want to hit the...
Andrew Florance: Yes. Yes, I'll take that. Back in the heart of the last crisis, Ten-X peaked out, I believe it was between $100 million and $110 million of revenue, all of which was on distressed properties. And so you can clearly see there's significant potential. Whereas today, we are only between 15% and 20% of our revenue in Ten-X is coming from distressed. So it gives you some sense of based on your numbers of $70 million, take that distressed and then consider we could get to those historic levels, depending on the size of this downturn, then there's a big wave of opportunity there on the distressed from the historical revenue side.  And remember that the '08 distress didn't show up, the dislocation I didn't show up until '14 in full force. And that was really residential, not commercial. And so commercial like you could see comparable levels of the stress. I do believe that this time around, Ten-X is a much stronger product. The product is now integrated with LoopNet and CoStar. It is much more automated. The sales force is approaching twice the size of the sales force that they had at the last cycle, and it's very scalable.  So 2 things could happen together over the -- like just before I say that, we are building Ten-X to be a performing asset product so that, that has a core foundation of performing sales going forward. But there's no denying that it does really well in distressed environments. So you'll eventually see an end to the buyer/seller expectation disconnect, and they'll connect, you'll see trade rates go back up, and you could see distressed levels quadruple over the next 2 or 3 years. And that would just -- I think Scott's alluded to it, that could get you, I believe, well above the peak of the last cycle.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair.
Stephen Sheldon: Really strong trends in multifamily this quarter. It sounds like the backdrop is becoming even more favorable. And your sales capacity and productivity continues to improve. So curious how you're thinking about the potential growth there, especially heading into the first half of 2023 and the potential for continued acceleration with any visibility you have at this point?
Scott Wheeler: Sure, Stephen. Thanks for the question. We're sort of giving any guidance, of course, at this stage for the next year. But you clearly noticed the trends in growth for multifamily have gone from a trough of 6% year-over-year, up to 11%. Now we expect it to be 16%. And based on the strength of this last quarter's sales, then we would expect that to continue north. We've always talked about getting back to those 20% growth rates in multifamily delivered a few years ago. And the way we think of it now is that we have certainly price moving north as the number of leads we produce in the platform have dropped the price per lead for our customers. So those are resonating well.  We're starting to see volumes come back into the platform, which we believe can deliver a good mid- to upper single-digit growth range for the business. And then like I mentioned, we're starting to see upgrades, outpace downgrades, which prior to the pandemic, that impact was typically in the 8% to 10% range a quarter.  So I think we have 3 really strong levers each to have capability of delivering high single-digit growth rates. I can't call which of that mix is going to happen in which quarter next year, but I think that's the measures we're looking at. And as Andy mentioned, our goal of doubling that sales force to get us to penetrate the other half of the large-scale market we haven't reached, and the vast majority of the mid-market that we haven't reached, there seems to be a great platform for us to extend into the market.  So hopefully, that color gives you a little sense of the progression we'll see next year and into the future..
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC.
Ashish Sabadra: I wanted to focus on the M&A pipeline, particularly with the $750 million of equity raised. I understand it was opportunistic, but also should we assume that was that something is imminent? And then obviously, you've shown intent in the past to do some transformational deal on residential side. Is that an area that you would continue to focus on?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So we obviously have a great balance sheet now approaching $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet and continue to be strongly cash flow positive. So our primary new initiative is residential. So we are looking at all the opportunities out there in the residential space. And right now, we're in an environment where things are shifting very rapidly to a buyer's favor. And the question is, how rapidly and when is the right time to move on certain things. So we're very active in looking for M&A opportunities, but we're also monitoring market conditions and want to get the best results for the shareholders moving at the right time. Not being too greedy, but trying to observe a rapidly shifting environment right now to our favor.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of Mayank Tandon from Needham & Company.
Mayank Tandon: Andy and Scott, congrats on the quarter. I wanted to focus for a moment on CoStar Suite. Could you maybe just peel back the growth from new accounts, logos versus increased penetration within the installed base and then the impact of pricing? I think, Scott, maybe you referenced that in your prepared remarks, but maybe a little bit more details around the underlying drivers of that segment specifically would be helpful.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Mayank. Yes, I did mention that a little over half of our growth is coming from new customers, and it's -- as we've added so many good platforms with hospitality and with lender and now the fund information that's coming out, CMBS data, it's a broad customer set that our sellers are having a lot of success in. So new customers are a strong part of our growth.  As you know, we are continuing to move more and more of our customer base onto the global CoStar platform that provides all the data and the product capabilities. That continues, and that's still providing a few basis points of growth or a few percentage points of growth across the platform, which is really, I consider a strong mix increase of around 3% to 4%. And then the remaining parts of those growth are split between increases in our renewals year-over-year, as well as existing customers then expanding their licenses or expanding their user numbers on the platform.  So those are the -- if you look at the top 4 areas that are driving the CoStar growth, you see those rise to the top in this quarter. It may shift a bit from quarter-to-quarter, but I think that gives us a strong platform to continue that size of growth going forward.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist.
Unidentified Analyst: It's Scott stepping on for Andrew. So my question is end market health. Could you kind of discuss what you're seeing with customer sales cycles? How has that changed as the years progressed?
Andrew Florance: Can you repeat that first part of the question? You're looking at -- we lost the first part of the question there.
Unidentified Analyst: Sorry. Could you talk about end market health for your customers and just how the sales cycle is behaving as it kind of gotten elongated as we get further into the year?
Scott Wheeler: End market health. That's what you said. It's clear.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So at this point, at this point, we are not seeing any of our customers in materially diminished health. Obviously, individual owners of properties may be experiencing levels of distress with high vacancy rates or disadvantageous refinancing on properties that may have been pro forma at lower interest rates. But those individual owner situations don't tend to impact us. Even if somebody is having refinancing difficulties, they may -- they would still want to keep those properties filled. They would still want to understand what's happening in the markets.  So at this point, we are not seeing anything negative on sales cycle or any real significant customer distress. And we continue to operate in an environment where we would expect that -- I expect and believe that as you did see end market distress, you have offsetting countercyclical factors that also kick in.
Operator: The next question today comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: I wanted to ask the M&A question a little differently. With respect to your residential strategy, can you discuss whether your 5-year target assume M&A? Or are you able to get there organically? And if there is M&A assumed in resi, is your focus more on acquiring residential data or residential online traffic?
Scott Wheeler: George, this is Scott. Thanks for the question. And just to clarify, in our long-term guidance, we gave the 5-year outlook, it did not include any M&A. Those are all organic numbers and any M&A would either supplant organic or be on top of organic in those outlooks. So hopefully that will clarify at least the assumptions we had in that outlook. And then Andy, do you want to take the...
Andrew Florance: Yes. And the answer to the second part of the question is we would consider either both or neither. So we're comfortable acquiring and integrating unique content that helps build a more vibrant residential product. We are also experienced with and comfortable with acquiring traffic. And if we can't find the right company at the right price, we could achieve our goals organically. I think it's more likely than not, however, that there will be a number of opportunities over the next 5 years. It would be really hard to believe that there are not. And I am spending probably 20%, 25% of my time right now engaging in those opportunities. The price is too high.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question today comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Ryan on for Jeff Silber. Just 1 question on the CoStar Suite. What has been the feedback from customers on the transition over to the global solutions package? And then how did you expect that transition to flow through to average selling price?
Andrew Florance: What was the last part of that question?
Scott Wheeler: That was around flowing through the average selling price.
Unidentified Analyst: That's correct.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So the feedback has been very positive. We track Net Promoter Score, so we survey our clients extensively after any sort of interaction with them to understand how they're reacting to our products and services. We have seen a significant uplift in Net Promoter Score as people go from the local CoStar or the 1 or 2 modules of CoStar to go into the global suite.  And so that's really nice when you're out there achieving significant price uplifts and end up with a happier customer would, I believe, more likely to renew after you have gotten a price uplift. And it's sort of common sense because if you're just buying one of our modules for given cities, say, comps or just property, when you buy multiple modules and; multiple cities, it becomes a dramatically more powerful product with a lot more to offer the customer.  And at the end of the day, the price for our products, while they're not cheap, are not the primary factor. Most successful commercial real estate players can afford the product, and it's a very small percentage of their expense structure. So what they're much more interesting is the functionality and what it does for them. And so we're getting a very positive reaction from folks as they upgrade, and I think it will show higher renewal rates over time. And it definitely is lifting the ASP. Scott probably has some specific data on that.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. If you look at the increases on the upgrades that we've done so far, the average upgrade has been about 20% to 25% of the price being paid prior to the upgrade. So that's really good value accretion. But keep in mind, this isn't a significant number of our overall subscribers on CoStar. So the effect of the total growth rate is only 200 to 300 basis points or so.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. So I'll turn it back to Andy to wrap up.
Andrew Florance: Well, thank you very much, Bailey. I would like to thank everyone for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings call, and we look forward to speaking with you again in our year-end call on February 21, 2023, which will be our 98th consecutive earnings call with me having the honor being at the helm. And you can imagine, we're going to make a big deal about our 100th earnings call. But until then, stay safe, and thank you very much for participating.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-26 17:00:00) =====

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Cyndi. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Cyndi and Scott are in our Washington, D.C. office tonight, and I'm joining you from our London office, a little bit later in the evening. We delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, setting our third quarterly sales record in a row. Annualized net new sales bookings were $84 million in the second quarter, a 66% increase over the same quarter in 2021. Our three main products, CoStar, Apartments.com and LoopNet, all have exceptional sales quarters, growing a combined 81% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $536 million, growing 12% year-over-year, and coming in above the high end of our guidance range of consensus estimates. Our subscription revenue in the quarter grew to $428 million and clients subscribing for five years or more renewed at 97.8%. As we ramp up our investment in our residential product strategies, we continue to deliver strong profit results with adjusted EBITDA of $159 million in the second quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range and consensus. As a result, we will raise our full year 2022 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance. Revenue for our CoStar product was $207 million in the second quarter, representing a 17% increase over the same quarter a year ago. CoStar net new sales bookings increased by 60% in the second quarter, making the last four quarters the highest sales quarters on record. The trailing 12-month sales level as of June 30th is 145% greater than the same period 12 months prior. Our consistent strong revenue and sales performance for CoStar is the result of a steady stream of product innovations that deliver expanded capabilities and increased customer value. Over the past few years, we've added hospitality data, integrated CMBS data and analytics, launched a new lender product and opened up full multinational reach for our CoStar customers. We continue to grow our subscriber base and now have 177,000 CoStar professional users. This quarter, we crossed over 40,000 subscribing sites. CoStar's ASP continues to climb as we transition more and more of our customers to our global solutions. Overall, I'm very confident in our ability to sustain our current levels of strong double-digit revenue growth for CoStar Group. I think I've been saying that for 30 years. Apartments.com turned in an outstanding performance in the second quarter with net new sales bookings up 138% compared to the second quarter of last year. This is the second highest quarterly sales ever for Apartments.com. Sequential growth in sales was 35% in the second quarter of this year, which makes this the third quarter in a row of improving sales results. Apartment vacancy rates have increased at a rapid pace throughout the first half of 2022, climbing – quickly climbing from the all-time low vacancy rates for the third quarter of 2021 that were suppressing demand for apartment advertising. Vacancy rates for three, four and five star properties were up 60 basis points to 5.7% in the second quarter from that all-time low of 5.1% in the third quarter of 2021. We're now only 80 basis points below the historic pre-pandemic vacancy rate average for that class of properties. We believe we'll be back to the historic average vacancy rates in the next several quarters. One of the drivers there is demand for apartments stalled in the second quarter of 2022 with absorption of only 67,000 units. That is a dramatic 74% drop from the 260,000 unit absorption level in the second quarter of 2021. New apartment construction deliveries are expected to reach record levels this year, the forecasted 415,000 unit deliveries are on par with the highest levels recorded since the mid-80s, Tampa and Phoenix, for example, will add over 25,000 units while absorption in these markets is projected to be a third of new supply. The need to fill these newly constructed apartments building clearly increases demand for apartments.com. With raising vacancy rates the number of properties advertising on apartments.com increased sequentially in the second quarter of 2022, continuing the positive trend that began in March this year. In addition, cancellation rates have improved by approximately 20 basis points since the end of last year. Our apartments.com sales force delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Sales productivity per person increased 64% year-over-year and is at an all-time high. With post-pandemic restrictions behind us, we’re once again, focused on in-person meetings with our customers and our prospects. In the second quarter of 2022 our field sales team conducted an impressive 55,000 in-person meetings with our clients. And that's up 35% from the first quarter of this year. This has always been a relationship-based industry and our in-person meetings are the most effective way to build customer satisfaction and demonstrate the value of our products. Traffic to our apartments.com network improves sequentially as we ramped up our advertising campaign, starting Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower, which delivered over four billion impressions in the second quarter alone. I am very happy with the outstanding results our apartments.com team is turning in. And I'm increasingly confident that our positive sales momentum will result in double-digit revenue growth in the second half of this year. Turning to CoStar Real Estate Manager, the product line continues to grow the Fortune 2000 and global customer base of CoStar adding 23 major new customers in Q2. Subscription revenue grew 15% in the first half of 2022, over the same period in 2021. We're on path to have the Real Estate Manager product integrated into CoStar by 2023, this will significantly increase revenue opportunity for CoStar by connecting the Fortune 2000 tenant organic customer base, a real estate manager with the power of the CoStar network. Lands of America are rural land marketplaces focusing on three key growth initiatives. These initiatives include growing the field sales team, introducing signature ads and launching land.com. We've grown our salesforce at lands by 16% year-to-date. Last year, lands of America began offering signature ads similar to the differentiated signature ads at Apartments.com and LoopNet offer. This quarter lands launched platinum signature ads. Our standard ads cost $22.75 per month on average, our gold ads average much higher number, $359 per month. And the platinum ads average $599 per month. Since the recent launch we've sold 932 signature ads. Growing the sales force and introducing premium exposure listings help drive 23.4% year-over-year revenue growth this quarter in the lands of America business. Later this quarter, we will redirect landsofamerica.com to our URL land.com to harness the power of the simple, memorable and valuable domain. lands.com will then join category definers like apartments.com and homes.com. Lunet had the strongest sales quarter in years with net new sales booking growing 43% of the same quarter last year. Second quarter revenue was $56 million up 10% over the prior year. I'm encouraged to see our efforts to build a Lunet net sales force are progressing well. Year-to-date we've grown a dedicated Lunet sales team by 95%. We've built a strong infrastructure with regional sales management team and a strong training program. Our training and onboarding process is much more effective now that we're able to train in onboard together in-person. As a result our new sales team is delivering 100% more sales in their six-month in production then when compared to Lunet sales team, we onboard remotely during the pandemic. Traffic to our Lunet network of sites remain strong in the second quarter, averaging approximately 12 million unique visitors per month. We have an order of magnitude more traffic than our closest competitor. That gap between Lunet and our next closest traffic competitor widens by one million unique visitors during the second quarter. So we're pulling away even further. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our SEO, the quality of our content, the strength of our brand, the quality of site design the performance of the site and the impact of our Space for Dreams advertising campaign which generated $253 million impressions in the second quarter. We believe that LoopNet will deliver significantly more value to customers, users, and shareholders as an international platform. Trillions of dollars across many borders to invest in commercial real estate, an international platform has significant scale advantages in software development, both in functionality and cost per user efficiency. We recently invested to relaunch LoopNet in Canada under LoopNet.ca, the number of monthly unique visitors on the Canadian LoopNet network has surged 45% year-over-year. That investment has significantly widened our competitive lead in Canada against the next closest CRE site Spacelist.ca. According to SEMrush in June of 2021, the LoopNet network had 48% more traffic than did Spacelist.ca. This June, the LoopNet network has pulled away and has 233% more traffic than does Spacelist.ca so a four, five times advantage. We're now investing significant energy into launching LoopNet in the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, and the rest of Europe in that order. In fact, I believe our President of LoopNet just saw him on the video screen in France just now. We currently own leading Siri marketplaces across the UK, Europe with Realla in the UK and BureauxLocaux in France and Belbex in Spain. When we compete, we will have one code base for LoopNet globally and redirect when we're complete with integration, we'll have one code base for LoopNet globally, and we'll redirect traffic from our family of European platforms into LoopNet. Users will be able to use LoopNet to search for investments or properties to lease from Madrid to Paris of London, to New York or San Francisco or Vancouver or more. A property owner with an industrial facility at Heathrow, we’ll be able to appropriately market to robust audiences that may need that warehouse from around the world with just one placement on LoopNet.com. Conventional wisdom is that real estate marketplaces are local product and lack cross-border value or synergy. I believe this couldn't be further from the truth is just assumed because few have made the effort to try and do it. When we released CoStar in the UK in 2012 and rolled out our – rolled our predecessor offering focus into CoStar, our revenues in the UK doubled in the years that followed. About half of CoStar users today now have global subscriptions that can easily access data across borders. 15,800 U.S. users access data in Canadian properties this year, 1,200 Canadian users are accessing data on U.S. properties. 7,600 U.S. users are accessing information on UK properties and 2,300 UK users are accessing data on U.S. properties. In total, just under 20% of all users have accessed tens of millions of property views across borders with CoStar. We intend to release international LoopNet in the UK in the fourth quarter. I'm grateful to be a small part of such an exciting and challenging product with a great team executing this work. Our CoStar Risk Analytics business continued to gain momentum with strong growth driven by the recently released CoStar for Lenders solution. Since released in February, we assigned 66 clients, of which 42 were added in Q2. We believe this growth rate will continue to accelerate with investment in our dedicated sales team the next phase of product innovation and marketing. The strategy behind CoStar for Lenders is to offer a highly scalable, fully integrated solution that is essential to market participants by supporting their risk management, regulatory requirements, loan production, strategic decision-making. The CoStar lender value proposition meets the requirements of our initial client base, which are diverse, including banks, credit units, DUS lenders, private lenders, and life insurance companies of which the CRE portfolios range from as small as $10 million, up to huge $50 billion portfolios. BizBuySell, our leading Business for Sale marketplaces, having a great year. Our revenue grew 27% year-over-year with investments in sales and marketing, driving strong increases in listing supply and buyer demand. We are realizing tremendous synergy between LoopNet and BizBuySell. Business to BizBuySell subscriber listings displayed on LoopNet increased 54% in the first half of the year, reported sold business comps increased 19% in the first half to 44,754 business comps. Thousands of business owners leverage these comps every month to get an estimate of their business' value. BizBuySell accounts of the largest franchise brands among its customers, including 7-Eleven, Mike's Muffler, The UPS Store, Jiffy Lube, Checkers, Jackson Hewitt, and many more open the door to deeper relationships across other CoStar real estate products. SDR continues to grow revenue and add new hotels contributing data while the hotel industry recovers from the global pandemic. SDR now has an all-time high of almost 75,000 hotels contributing daylight data on a monthly basis. There's still 1,500 hotels that previously participated and are currently closed due to COVID. And half of those are in Asia. SDR revenues year-to-date are up 10% year-over-year. When CoStar acquired SDR at the end of 2019, subscription revenue was 60% of total revenues with focused effort, subscription revenue year-to-date is now 77% of total revenues. STR is currently migrating its benchmarking product into the CoStar platform. Customer migration will begin at the start of 2023. At the conclusion of the product rollout, the expectation is to be in a position to double STR revenue through sales of benchmarking to new customers and upgrade existing customers. STR will also be better positioned to introduce CoStar to new hospitality customers once the benchmarking product is in the CoStar platform. That introduction has already begun with STR selling CoStar to hospitalities companies such as Sonder, Hopper, visit [ph] Indianapolis, Atrium Hospitality and Highgate Hotels. Ten-X continues to perform with high volume of assets being brought to the platform, which exceeded $2 billion in the first half of 2022 or 33% over the first half of 2021, and the highest level of activity since 2015. As mentioned last quarter, we launched our Ten-X marketing program for 2022 called Battle of the Bids, which is a gamification of the Ten-X bidding process, in which people can guess the price at which a real estate property will be sold on Ten-X and have a chance to win millions of dollars in cash prizes. Nearly 13,000 brokers and owners have played the game, adding approximately 12,000 new Ten-X accounts. The bidding power on Ten-X is reaching record levels. When a potential bidder registers to bid on Ten-X, we check to ensure that they have sufficient funds to buy the properties they bid on. The amount we prove for them is their proof of funds. In the second quarter of 2022, total proof of funds reached $11.7 billion, up 144% from $4.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020 when we acquired Ten-X. Our residential business continues to perform very well. Second quarter revenue in residential was $20 million, an increase of 40% on an organic basis, compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our Homesnap business continues to focus on expanding age engagement and sales of our Pro+ products, while we develop our Homes.com marketplace. Registered agents for our Homesnap Pro product totaled 880,000 at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 17% over the same quarter last year. Revenue from our Pro+ products grew an impressive 46% year-over-year, while our concierge Pro+ product grew 175% versus the second quarter of last year. Agents continue to spend more and more in our residential products with average agent spend increasing 42% on a year-over-year basis. It’s important that we continue to grow our sales force to reach more agents and prepare for the launch of our Homes.com product next year. We’ve successfully established our direct sales force to support the Pro+ product, and I’m encouraged by the initial sales productivity of that team. We have plans to expand this team to over 100 dedicated sales representatives by the end of 2022. In the second quarter, we grew that team by almost 50%, including adding field-based sales agents who are having some real success. Our research efforts are off to a good start as we build proprietary content for Homes.com around playgrounds, neighborhood, schools and other features that are important to consumers. From a standing start, we have successfully engaged over 1,000 photographers, writers, editors, voice talent and video editors across the country. So far, we have produced content on over 70% of the largest residential markets in the U.S. We expect our rich original data and media content will produce significant organic search results that will be a product differentiator from our competitors. We successfully launched Citysnap in June in coordination with our partners at the Real Estate Board of New York. For the first time, New York renters, buyers and brokers now have a single real-time source for all available Real Estate Board of New York listings. Better yet, all of an agent’s listings appear for free on Citysnap. The launch of Citysnap was well received by the agent community in New York City and in only a few short weeks, over 37% of the Real Estate Board of New York agents have registered to use Citysnap. Citysnap reached the number one spot on the top new category in Google Play and is off to a strong start. As with any new product launch, this is only the beginning, version 1.0, we’re planning a regular pace of product releases focusing on optimizing the user experience and adding more valuable content, which we feel is the key differentiator for CoStar Group. Yesterday marked the formal launch of our Citysnap consumer marketing campaign. Our marketing campaigns are designed to deliver hundreds of millions of media impressions across streaming video, audio, digital, social and out-of-home media. Just before this call began, I got a word that we reached our first 1 million users of Citysnap. To realize our many growth initiatives, it’s imperative that we continue to attract and retain the best talent for CoStar Group, even Scott Wheeler. We’ve had tremendous headcount growth – I was just checking to make sure Scott is still listening, we’ve had tremendous headcount growth over the past six months, surpassing 5,400 team members for the first time in our company history. Our strategic goals of building our residential platform, international expansion and growing our sales teams have been extremely successful. Over the first half of the year, we’ve welcomed more than 1,000 new team members across multiple areas and around the globe. A big contributor to our increased headcount is the creation of hundreds of new jobs in our residential business, thousands of skilled photographers, drone pilots and content writers have applied to CoStar Group with hopes of being able to take part and documenting their cities, park, schools and neighborhoods and beautiful homes as we prepare our Homes.com relaunch later this year. Our new team members have listed a variety of reasons that they decided to come to CoStar Group, including our positioning as an innovative industry leader, our high-performing and fast-paced work environment, the opportunity to build new businesses and products and services for our customers. However, the top reason most new hires mentioned when joining CoStar is the people they get to work with and learn with here. While CoStar offers flexibility to our colleagues, we predominantly work on our mission together in the office, and we thrive in that environment. We believe that working together rather than on a remote screen is becoming competitive edge. For example, and an example of many, the very talented and valuable new colleague, Leslie Hall joined CoStar Group in May to grow our HR business partner function after a successful 26-year career at another very well-known and respected Washington area company, that is still all remote despite maintaining millions of square feet of empty premium office space. She said, I’ve built a career in HR because I love partnering with people solving business problems. She goes on to say, after 2.5 years of remote working on Zoom, I missed the in-person collaboration in connection with business leaders and employees. You simply cannot maintain meaningful and sustainable relationships virtually over the long-term. She was impressed with the caliber of people she met during the interview process and their commitment and enthusiasm for CoStar. We are thrilled to welcome Leslie and 1,000 other new colleagues to CoStar this year. When we first returned to the office last year, that was difficult for some of our colleagues and initially our retention rate dropped. But surprisingly, now that we’re back together in the office, our retention rates are climbing to some of the highest levels we’ve ever seen. According to Castle Security, while many workers in the U.S. have returned to working together in the office, most have not, many think that workers and companies that do not work with their colleagues in person do not form meaningful connections to their companies. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this pandemic induced great resignation. Overall private industry attrition trends remain very elevated, 3.1%. Real estate attrition is slightly lower, 2.8%. I’m pleased to report that we are experiencing the opposite. Our attrition rates continue to improve and are now the best they’ve been in years. In fact, our attrition rate is now less than half of the private sector’s turnover rate. In the most recent 60-day trending, employee retention rate is an impressive 98.5%. We are retaining the best talent at CoStar Group, the average tenure for technology companies is three years. CoStar Group is a clear leader with an average tenure well above both – well above tech or real estate or private sector and is approaching an impressive five years, so five years compared to tech average three years. We’re retaining employees 60% longer than the average company. We’ve been deliberate in our execution of employee retention initiatives, including leadership development programs, management training, career mobility and promotions. In addition, we’ve enhanced our already strong suite of employee benefit offerings to adapt the needs of our people in the current environment. Our approach is proving particularly successful with regard to our sales force as we are simultaneously growing five different sales teams, all of which have the potential to add significant growth capability to the company. For the first half, we’ve grown our sales team by a net 150 sellers. That’s the fastest we’ve ever grown, an increase of 18% since the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. This is the largest half year organic growth in sales resources we’ve ever achieved. I’m carefully watching the growing productivity of these new salespeople were onboarding. We have invested carefully in our training programs with talented and committed trainers. I’m pleased to report that while it does take time to ramp up these new salespeople to full productivity, we’re exceeding our historic ramp-up success rate. Our commitment to in-person collaboration coupled with our investments and our people have us well positioned to continue to grow the business as well as execute our strategic objectives. The commercial real estate markets are entering a period of potential disruption as the U.S. economy adjusts to these higher levels of inflation, raising interest rates and lingering pandemic effects. With office vacancy rates climbing to 14%, we’re now observing the highest nationwide vacancy rates in 30 years. The gap between future availability rate and current vacancy is growing, suggesting a bit more pain ahead in vacancy. Office leasing continues to lag pre-crisis levels, central business districts are particularly challenged as more office space is being returned, contributing to slower recoveries. According to Kastle Systems, the percentage of people returned to office has remained around 40% with only modest increases in recent months. This persistent softness in the office market CoStar continues to outperform and our LoopNet and Ten-X products are countercyclical, should the office market deteriorate further. Industrial properties are experiencing the opposite of office properties. Industrial properties are maintaining record occupancy, double digit rent growth and booming construction. Retail leasing helped steady near post-pandemic highs in the second quarter, while new development remains sparse. The retail now – market is now reporting tighter conditions than prior to the pandemic as the amount of retail space available for lease held to the lowest level in over a decade. Store openings remaining – are remaining on pace to significantly eclipse store closures this year. Transaction volumes for commercial real estate properties continue to reach new highs over $216 billion traded during the second quarter, leading to a second quarter record and a record breaking first half for the year. Price depreciation continues across all asset classes with industrial, multi-family leading and retail and office lagging. So far this year distress commercial property sales remain low encompassing only 1,300 assets representing less than 1.5% of all sales. CMBS delinquencies at 30, 60 and 90 days continue to decline in the second quarter, we anticipate that the rise in interest rates will create difficulties with loan maturities and refinancing in the months and years ahead. According to a leading CMBS mortgage servicer request for loan extensions increased 38% request for loan, restructuring increased 21% in the second quarter. An increase in delinquencies could represent a significant revenue opportunity for Ten-X. Well, after those brief remarks, I’m going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I love those brief remarks. I’m happy to report given on the call that I’m still retained with CoStar even after that script and I’m awake and listening. Part of the statistics interesting that five year retention on customers is 98%. And we have a retention rate of our employees 98% with an average tenure of five years. Is that art imitating life in CoStar? Is that what you would say? I know that’s fascinating anyway.
Andy Florance: Hotel California, you can check in that people never leave.
Scott Wheeler: That’s why I stay around here. Facts are amazing. All right. Let’s talk about our revenue by our services and Andy reported CoStar is growing 17% in the second quarter, price and new sales volumes each are contributing roughly half of that revenue growth. So we expect revenue growth in the 16% to 17% range in the third and fourth quarters. And the lower end of the range is really a result of some negative [Audio Dip] movements as the dollar strengthened around 10% to 15% over the past year against the pound. So on an organic currency adjusted basis, we’re going to keep that 17% going in the second half. Our second quarter multi-family revenue grew 6% in lack of the guidance and that most definitely represents the turning point for Apartments.com revenue growth will increase going forward. The sales levels have continued to improve in each quarter since the third quarter of 2021 and the total number of properties advertising on our network increased sequentially in the second quarter compared to the first quarter this year. We expect third quarter revenue growth of 11%, fourth quarter growth of 14% in [Audio Dip] family. This [Audio Dip] increased to our prior full year revenue estimate, we now expect full year revenue growth of 9% in multi-family. LoopNet revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, also in line with our expectations. The net new bookings increased 43% year-over-year as we’ve increased both our LoopNet and our CoStar sales, both of which sell LoopNet very effectively. We expect this trend to continue through the remainder of the year, increasing our third quarter revenue growth to 13%. This results in an increase in our full year revenue growth estimate to a range of 11% to 12%. Information services revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, a little ahead of our guidance. Real estate management continues to post solid double digit growth and STR is now back to double digit revenue on a constant currency basis, which is really a great recovery news for STR even before global hotels have all recovered from the pandemic. In addition, we added Business Immo to our info services revenue, which we acquired at the beginning of the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect revenue growth of 11% and we’re increasing our full year expectation for information services revenue growth to 10%. Residential revenue increased 11% over the second quarter last year and organically excluding the effect of the wind down of the [Audio Dip] revenue from Homes.com, revenue grew around 40% in the second quarter on a like for like basis as Andy mentioned. We now expect full year 2022 revenue of $73 million in residential, which is above our prior guidance of $70 million. Revenue growth for the second half of the year will be down 20% to 25% again, as a result of the Homes.com revenue in the second half of 2021 that was wound down and no longer exists in the second half of 2022. Holding that aside, the year-over-year growth in our Pro Plus subscription product is expected to be around 35% in the second half of the year, which is where we remain our focus in growing our sales force. The other market revenue [Audio Dip] in the second quarter 2022 is expected with lands and business for sale marketplaces posting growth rates of 25% or more. Ten-X performed well in the quarter against our strategic [Audio Dip] increasing the volume of assets as well as the bidding power on the demand side of the marketplace. We expect the other marketplace to grow around 18% for the full year of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was [Audio Dip], $31 million above the high end of second quarter guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% compared to 31% in the second quarter of 2021. Approximately 10% of the favorable adjusted EBITDA is from revenue outperformance, while 90% was from comparability, primarily all of which relates to the timing of our investments in content development for our residential product. We’re off to a good start mobilizing our content teams across the country, and they’re going to produce tens and thousands of pieces of proprietary content. Our initial second quarter spending forecast on this effort contemplated a very steep spending ramp in the second quarter, which in hindsight, I must say too aggressive. Accordingly, we’ve shifted around [Audio Dip] million of our second quarter cost favorability to the second half of the year, the ramp up in content development will continue. Also, our existing field research team is doing a great job contributing more residential content than we had anticipated. This makes much more efficient outcome and it lowers our incremental costs. If this trend continues, we could even see additional investment favorability in the second half of the year. So overall, we estimate our 2022 residential investment levels now in the $180 million to $200 million range. Our sales force totaled approximately 975 people in -- on June 30, an increase of 105 [ph] sales reps from the end of last quarter and an increase of only 150 reps from where we began the year. Our [Audio Dip] is the largest increase our sales in a quarter or a half year, and it’s a well-balanced increase across all of our major product areas. Contract renewal rate was 91% for the second quarter of 2022, similar to the 91% renewal rate in the first quarter of this year. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the second quarter of 2022, compared to 77% this time last year and consistent with the first quarter of this year. Turning to the outlook, we expect full year 2022 revenues to range from $2.165 billion to $2.18 billion, an increase of approximately $12.5 [Audio Dip] at the midpoint of the range, implying an annual growth rate of 12% at the midpoint. Organic growth, excluding the revenue runoff from the Homes.com products is expected to be 13%. Third quarter 2022 revenue expected in a range from $552 million to $557 million, representing growth of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. Once again, organic growth, excluding those pesky running off Homes.com legacy revenues, is expected at 12%. The 2022 full year adjusted EBITDA is expected now to be in the range of $610 million to $630 million, which is an increase of $20 million from our previous guidance. Roughly half of the increase is improvement in our revenue outlook with the other half the result of lower forecasted residential levels that I just mentioned. For the third quarter 2022, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million, indicating a margin of 24% at the midpoint. With regards to capital allocation, our strategy remains unchanged. With interest rates on the rise and economic uncertainty and market volatility, we see valuations moderating with regards to acquisition opportunities. Our balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities should they arise in the near future. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Cindy to orchestrate the anxiously awaited Q&A session. Cindy, back to you.
Cyndi Eakin: Thank you, Scott. I would like to ask participants to keep one question and one part, please. I’ll turn it over to Austin, if you could please open up the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with George Tong from Goldman Sachs. George, your line is open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You indicated that multifamily vacancy rates are improving. To what extent do vacancy rates need to reach historical levels before Apartments.com revenue growth can return to 20% organic? And what’s the timing for this recovery?
Andy Florance: Well, I think we’re on the way to that, and you’re already seeing our second best sales quarter ever. So, I think it’s just a question of continuing to do that for a year or so. And the trends appear to be clear and obvious, and expected. So, I think we’re on our road to that result. Would you want to add anything there, Scott?
Scott Wheeler: No, I’ve been encouraged that even as the industry recovers and the vacancies start to move up slightly, our sales performance is recovering faster than the industry, which speaks to the strength of the platform. So, we definitely expect Apartments.com back up to that 20% that you alluded to, George. We haven’t given any guidance or outlook into 2023 yet, but when we do, we’ll be sure to let you know when that’s expected. Thanks for the question.
George Tong: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is with Pete Christiansen from Citi. Pete, your line is open.
Pete Christiansen: Thank you. Good evening. Thanks for the question. Scott, I was wondering, I just wonder to dig a little bit into the multifamily a little bit, break it apart. In terms, you had a great sales quarter. How should we think about at least the glide path in terms of revenue per property versus new volumes coming on? Just generally, how do you see the next two or three quarters forming out after a big sales score?
Scott Wheeler: Yeah. Hi Pete, thanks for the question. The revenue growth up to this point as the industry is still rebalancing a bit of where it place ads on the different levels that we offer is primarily the price movements that we've put in place this year. So price is running ahead of the percent that we're talking about. We're starting to see sequential volumes move up. So I'd expect those to start moving as we annual to the low to mid single digits. And I would expect our pricing to stay in that in high single digit range that we're seeing. When the vacancy rates move up a little higher, we then to start to see people moving up the ad stacks again as they need to create more leads for their vacancies. So I think it's when you add that positive mix shift on top of low-to-mid single digit volumes and mid single digits pricing and then you start to add sales people all those will add up then to get back to that 20% that George referenced a bit earlier. So we expect those trends to continue through the rest of year and then strong 2023.
Pete Christiansen: Great, thank you.
Andy Florance: I apologize, unfortunately, it looks like our DC line is cracking out a little bit there. So Scott is not trying to avoid the answer. We will have a brand new telephone line for the next earnings call. But the and I had to come all the way to London to find a good line. But yeah, so I think one of the things that will really drive, like there is tons of penetration opportunity apartment still. We are definitely in the early days of that opportunity and we're adding sales people at a great clip and that will drive a new account business and new units for sure. And I think we'll be able to continue to get a price as people are advertising new construction and a like.
Pete Christiansen: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is with Jeff Meuler from Baird. Jeff, your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Curious of your views of how you're assessing your recent ad spend efficiency, spending a big budget, I guess, into a market where some other advertisers are pulling back for or macro reasons just are you seeing lift? Are you reinvesting the lift? Just any comment on ad spend efficiency?
Andy Florance: I think that the sales results in the quarter sort of speak for themselves, we're having tremendous growth across LoopNet traffic growth, revenue growth apartments is having tremendous sales growth. So I think that we're getting good results. I mean, we're hearing all the concerns of doom and gloom that everyone else is talking about. But I have to say in our business, we simply are not seeing any of that. And we're watching for it, but it's not there. So we're continuing invest in the opportunity and getting great, good results.
Jeff Meuler: And I guess what I'm wondering is are you actually benefiting from advertisers pulling back in other channels that would otherwise compete with you for ad spend, as you try to drive traffic to your sites?
Andy Florance: I think we probably are. I mean, obviously one of the biggest single budgets is our SCM budgets and it's a little difficult to, like, I think we've had a continuous progression of better and better efficiency, lower cost on our target keywords on SCM. It's tough to separate that continued gain efficiency from just the way we bid and the way we get brand recognition and our click-through rates. It's tough to separate that from less congestion competition. So we are continuing to get efficiency, but it's tough to suss out what component is less competition. I imagine going into 2023, we probably will see it like obviously and clearly.
Jeff Meuler: Terrific, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is with Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Stephen, your line is open.
Stephen Sheldon: Hey, thanks. So it sounds like you're making progress on the residential content build out. So can you remind us when you plan to plug all that proprietary content back into homes.com, how quickly that could potentially support stronger organic search traffic. And then I might get slapped on the wrist here for asking, but asking another part, but what did overall traffic to the residential assets look like in the second quarter? Apologies, if I missed that.
Andy Florance: Yes. So where we would expect to see that content really start to make a difference is as you go into 2023. I have been sitting down with the content teams periodically, and I’ve been looking at the content we’re building, and I have to say, I feel really good about the fact the potential of that content. I mean, individually the different things we’re building look pretty powerful when I think about it with my SEO hat on, I think in some across massive scale, it should be awesome. But that we’re not going to see any of that really impacting till the earliest, the very end of this year and really the beginning of 2023. So right now the traffic growth, I don’t have the year-over-year traffic growth with me, Cyndi has it. You’re not going to see major traffic growth until we relaunch the homes platform and start to bring that content in. Do you have a number there Cyndi for year-over-year homes growth?
Cyndi Eakin: Yes, I think it’s up slightly, but as you mentioned, it’s we’re really going to look to get that growth through the marketing and advertising campaign launch.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, we were pretty much in line with where we were in the first quarter without spending any additional money on marketing.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is with Ryan Tomasello from KBW. Ryan, your line is open.
Ryan Tomasello: Thanks. In terms of M&A and specifically regarding residential, was wondering if you see an opportunity to execute a similar playbook, as you did with Apartments.com in terms of consolidating the peer, any peer residential portals to accelerate that timeline around those consumer traffic goals that you set out. I realized some of those peers operate with alternative revenue and business models, including in the brokerage space. How feasible you think those types of deals could be if they were attractive?
Andy Florance: Well. As usual, we don’t comment anything specific. But I will say that I have been flying more in the last month than I’ve ever flown in my life. There’s – it’s an interesting time. I mean, we have a great balance sheet with a lot of cash. I think we’ve just turned in a really strong quarter. We’ve got strength in all of our businesses and I believe that we’re seeing valuations across half dozen, dozen interesting companies fall to become more and more attractive. So we think that your question is not terribly far off of a range of opportunities we have out in the world. But it’s just – it’s sort of obvious in the time we’re in a company like ours with a great balance sheet, super performance, a track record of M&A and following values both in the United States and Europe are interesting.
Operator: Our next question is with John Campbell from Stephens, Inc. John, your line is open.
John Campbell: Hey guys, great work on the quarter. Scott, you briefly touched on this, but I think the original 2022 guidance called for, I think it was $200 million, $220 million of a step up. In resi investment, it sounds like you’re now expecting maybe $20 million less moving forward. So I guess first did I hear that right? And then secondly if you could maybe unpack how much of that hit in the first half versus what’s expected in the second half, and then also just to refresh from the expected kind of breakdown and spend across content and marketing?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Hi, John. [Audio Dip] for the question. Yes, we had initially estimated the $200 million to $220 million level of spend as you appreciate that was early in the year. We had a strong ramp up in the second quarter in content, more aggressive, like I mentioned, than we actually were able to achieve in the [Audio Dip] which very positive sign. So my current estimate puts us in the – about $20 million below where we were originally about half of that is [Audio Dip]. A little bit of it’s from just sure I have enough cost in there for my longer-term estimates, given the uncertainty you start off the year with. And then the [Audio Dip] timing the ramp that some of that’ll push out of the year, given the amount of time left in the second half. So we still [Audio Dip] with half or a little less than half of that spend is going to be in content and probably about 45% of it’s in marketing, which might be a little higher than we thought at first given success of Citysnap and other doing and then the rest is technology and other costs. So we’ve probably got a [Audio Dip] of it in the second half and probably around 35 or a little more than that in the first half. That helps with the pacing.
John Campbell: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you.
Andy Florance: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is with Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Ashish, your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Hi. I just wanted to focus on the CoStar Suite product, particularly the Lender product. You talked about some pretty good traction there signing up 66 new clients. I was just wondering as you, with this initial success how do you think about the addressable market now and in terms of like how many clients are out there and total addressable market? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yes. So I think, I mean, again the wonderful thing it's 66 new customers, most of them in the last quarter – 40 some in the last quarter. Great pace we've got, I think, 12 to 14 dedicated sales reps on that right now. The addressable market is I'm going to do this from memory but it is approximately 6,000 to 7,000 lenders who have portfolios. Again we're selling to folks with very small portfolios and very large portfolios then watching the gross margin, these implementations, they look reasonably good. So we believe that the opportunity is well north of $300 million on this product. And it's a wonderful addition to our growth drivers because it's all – it's all new opportunity.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful too. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is with Gustavo Laguarda from Truist. Gustavo, your line is open.
Gustavo Laguarda: Hi there. Just wanted to ask on how the roadmap on, so resi, just comparing it to the multifamily ramp, how traffic is doing this far along versus how it was doing for multifamily back in the day? That would be super helpful. Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yes. So I think it's very similar because back in the day we've picked up an Apartments.com from Classified Ventures, a consortium of newspapers and we completely re-imagined and rebuilt the site over the course of 270 days or so. This one's a little bit bigger scale project but you set a strategy, you have a talented team from both software and field research and content building us up and you'll really see growth in traffic once you release the product. And then once you begin to invest in SCM and in brand marketing. So that's going to be the end of this year, beginning of next year. And so it's very similar, but I think you and I, and everybody are impatient to see that story unfold over the next couple years.
Operator: Our next question is with Mayank Tandon from Needham. Mayank, your line is open.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening, Andy looking at CoStar Suite as a whole, do you remind us sort of where the penetration is with brokers and outside the broker world where you obviously have very strong presence? Where are you seeing the best opportunities for growth? Looking out over the Canadian term?
Andy Florance: I think the most exciting – well, obviously lender is very exciting, several hundred million of opportunity there. The owner sector remains very exciting to us because it's a huge market. It is a later stage penetration market and its penetration rates there probably a third quarter where the broker market penetration rates are. So that one is just the Goliath that just is we can keep on working for years. One of the ones that I alluded to briefly in my comments about real estate manager is the Top 2,000 tenants in the United States. Major corporation’s folks who often are buying real estate manager from us. They're an obvious potential market opportunity for us corporation with hundreds of facilities. It is a no brainer to have access to CoStar Group and a good broker. And then it depresses me a little bit when I look at the penetration rate for brokers, because having been very successful at selling this product for many, many years we still haven't penetrated all the broker opportunities out there. There's still hundreds of millions of potential penetration in brokers. So when you look at mid-size smaller brokers and even some not so midsize like upper midsize brokers, all the major guys do subscribe and rely on it, but there's penetration opportunity across the board and Scott and I were joking before the call someone's going to ask about, can we sustain the growth rates on CoStar? And it really is something where I've answered that question for decades from the point at which we had $7 million of revenue now. And one of the things I really look forward to is crossing through a billion in CoStar revenue and then talking to you guys about the story for $2 billion in CoStar revenue, and, oh, by the way, I'm talking to you from London and we are working hard on beginning and continue to carry CoStar out throughout Europe and other markets and I there's a super exciting opportunity. CoStar changes its whole meaning to a lot of compliance when it allows people to see investment opportunities and asset classes across borders. So that's a whole another driver. So my answer is yes, I'm very excited about growing CoStar. Huge numbers for a long, long time, and we're just beginning. Yes. Okay.
Operator: Our next question is with Joe Goodwin from JMP. Joe, your line is open.
Joe Goodwin: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. Just curious, Andy, how are you thinking about price increases across the CoStar Suite today as well as if you could comment on price increases on Apartments.com, the ad tiers? And if your approach to price increases is changing in the current environment at all?
Andy Florance: Yes, it is. A company like ours must be disciplined and set our prices in real dollars, not nominal dollars. And so we are watching that closely with the sales force at renewals. And we're reminding people not just with the nominal dollar increases are what the real dollar realities are. So that's very important with Apartments, especially with Apartments where our clients are overwhelmingly doing incredibly well right now. So we have discipline on that, and you can see that in our results. On CoStar Suite, I think we're in a slightly different position. Yes, we are pushing our pricing to at least remain constant on a real dollar basis and a little bit more than that. And – but the real story there is this upselling activity we're in the middle of, where we're reaching out to these tens of thousands of customers who subscribe to a small piece of our product either in the modules they get or the geography they get, and we're upgrading them to our full all modules global suite because we want to see network effects grow across borders. And as I mentioned, we're seeing that happening. We're seeing tens of millions of searches across borders. So in CoStar Suite, it is tens of millions of properties being viewed across borders. In CoStar Suite, the more powerful driver is this upgrading, not price increasing. On LoopNet – on Ten-X, you don't have to move the pricing because in theory, it's a commission against the asset price and inflation in theory would move the asset price up. And Ten-X is more in a place of early days of penetration, it's like still 1% penetrating the opportunity. On LoopNet, we are focused on variable silver ad or base ad pricing, which will be a more powerful revenue driver than just price increases. So that's the initiative where we'll begin baiting it out in a couple of markets, pricing based on the market and on the asset value. So that will be a combination of lowering our prices for low-value assets in smaller markets to drive volume and revenue – overall revenue and increasing prices to recognize the value of the higher-end assets and bigger markets, that will dwarf surges inflation, pricing increases. So we're all over it. This is not our first rodeo. And the one thing I learned in my economics degree was the difference between real and nominal. I can't remember anything else, though.
Joe Goodwin: Awesome. Thank you so much Andy.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. [Operator Instructions]
Andy Florance: I think with that, we can wind it up. I want to congratulate Austin, our moderator, on her big news today. And thank you all for – which I'm not going to disclose. And I want to thank you all for joining us for the second quarter 2022 earnings call. And congratulations to all the sales leaders and product folks and developers who – and the research teams that basically put in tremendous effort, which delivered such a great quarter this year, and we look forward to this quarter. And we look forward to speaking with you again in the third quarter and giving you updates on all the various initiatives we've got going on. And we will get a new speaker phone in our Washington boardroom. I apologize for that. But thanks again for joining us.
Operator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the CoStar Group to report financial results for first quarter 2022. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to hand the conference over to Gene Boxer, General Counsel of CoStar Group. Thank you. Please go ahead.

 And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance. 
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Gene. You did that brilliantly. I think everyone on the call is left inspired. So good evening, everyone. And thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. 
 We had a really strong start to 2022 with our highest ever quarterly sales booking at $68 million, which increased 31% year-over-year in the first quarter. Both revenue and profit are ahead of forecast. Our CoStar product turned in its best sales quarter ever, driving our overall outperformance and is expected to grow at or above 15% year-over-year for the rest of 2022. Apartments.com delivered great sales results with net new sales bookings up 36% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. 
 Total revenue for the first quarter of '22 was $516 million, representing a 13% year-over-year growth rate. Our profit performance was equally strong with adjusted EBITDA of $178 million in the first quarter, an increase of 12% year-over-year and $18 million above the high end of our February guidance. As a result, we are raising our full year '22 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. Mr. Wheeler will give you more details on that. 
 CoStar flagship product produced $199 million in revenue in the first quarter. The CoStar sales team grew annualized net sales 96% over the prior year. This latest sales performance makes the last 3 quarters of CoStar sales the top 3 sales quarters for CoStar on record. 
 Our CoStar sales team has never been more productive. In the first quarter, we achieved the highest CoStar net sales output per person in our history. We added 20 new sellers to the team so far this year and intend to continue expanding our sales teams in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. I look forward to the day when we'll be able to tell you about hiring CoStar sales people in Germany, space -- Spain and France, not space, before long. We are building dedicated industry experts within the broader CoStar sales group to focus exclusively on banking and hospitality clients, 2 sectors that each hold hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue potential. 
 Our upgrade program to the full CoStar product continues to perform well, and we're now approximately 1/3 of the way through the campaign. We have completed approximately 7,100 customer upgrades, which we expect will generate about $22 million in annual revenue. We estimate the program has the potential to generate over $50 million in revenue and will continue for the next 18 months or so. 
 We released our new CoStar lender product in February and are seeing a very positive response from the market. In the short time since we launched the product, we've added over $1 million in annual revenue, and the operating pipeline is building rapidly. I must modestly say our clients are referring to the solution in terms of best-in-class, the gold standard and, even modestly, the best product we've ever seen. 
 The lender solution's early success can be attributed to its unique ability to connect the client's loan portfolio to CoStar's industry-leading property information, Market Analytics, and to COMPASS, one of the most mature credit default models in the industry. The system delivers a live look at institution's loan concentration risk, current expected credit losses and stress testing, among many other functions. The result is an unmatched, more efficient platform for strategic lending decisions and risk management. 
 Our initial banking customers have found the product very straightforward, simple and easy to use. The ability to generate sophisticated stress testing results with just a few clicks saves almost a week of work. Customers tell us they love all the loan concentration charts because the analytics are so much better and fully automated when compared to lesser competitive products. 
 Of course, we're in the very early days of introducing the lender product, but I'm very encouraged with the market reception results so far. We are currently operating with a dozen or so specialized dedicated sales team members, and we fully intend to expand our sales and product implementation teams in the months ahead. With at least 6,000 potential customers in the U.S. alone, we have a long way to go to realize what we see as a market opportunity for CoStar of well over $300 million. 
 I believe our impressive CoStar results are built on a well-balanced combination of new product innovation, proprietary data and research and a highly productive sales team. Our customers are enjoying the expanded capabilities that we add to CoStar every year and continue to renew subscriptions at rates above our long-term historical averages. 
 We continue to work hard on expanding our international business. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Business Immo, France's premier real estate new service. In France, you say Business Immo. Business Immo is known for its impactful online real estate news that attracts over 300,000 unique visitors each month. The publication boasts over 2,000 subscribing companies and 100,000 followers on social media. Business Immo's product portfolio also includes training, education and industry conferences. 
 Business Immo is an important addition to CoStar Group's growing global news team, which offers daily coverage across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany; and HotelNewsNow, our international hospitality industry news service. With over 235,000 subscribers and 19,000 articles published in 2021, CoStar's award-winning news is one of the largest international real estate news networks in the world. 
 Business Immo reaches a large professional audience in France of brokers, developers, owners and the like, and BureauxLocaux reaches the tenant audience in France. By combining these 2 audiences into 1 premium media buy, we believe that we can capture a large and meaningful share of the properties -- property market's advertising spend in France. 
 France is one of the most important real estate markets in the world with an estimated $40 billion in annual investment transaction value, and I believe the number will ultimately prove to be a lot larger than that. With the acquisition of Business Immo this year alongside the BureauxLocaux property marketplace, which we purchased last year, we're very excited about the potential this market holds for us. These 2 well-respected online property websites, combined with Belbex in Spain, Realla in the U.K., CoStar in the U.K. and Thomas Daily in Germany, directly support our goal of building out the premier online European marketing solutions and information solutions. We remain focused on offering both CoStar and LoopNet integrated and seamlessly across the U.K., Germany, France, Spain and eventually other European markets. 
 In the first quarter, we launched the first international version of LoopNet, rolling out loopnet.ca in Canada. Loopnet.ca delivers a tailored and localized Canadian search experience, including custom Canadian content, French Canadian language capability and acceptance of Canadian currency -- most importantly, acceptance of Canadian currency. We are seeing strong traffic growth in Canada with LoopNet dossier reaching traffic levels almost twice that of the nearest competitive site after less than 2 months in the market. LoopNet in Canada is only the beginning as the site architecture and international capabilities of the Canadian version of LoopNet will be the foundation of a first-ever pan-European, pan-Americas commercial real estate marketplace. 
 Apartments.com sales picked up strong momentum with bookings up 36% sequentially in the first quarter of '22. Revenue for Apartments.com was $175 million in the first quarter, growing 6% year-over-year with strong margins. Properties advertising on our platform increased in March over February, which is the first sequential increase in advertised property volumes since about the middle of '21. This increase, along with rising vacancies and improving pricing, makes me increasingly confident that we've turned the corner over last year's high occupancy headwinds. As you might recall, last year, we saw demand for apartment rental surge and then vacancy rates suddenly dropped to a 20-year low -- record low of just 4.8%. 
 Absorption was 700,000 units in '21, which is extremely high and is more double the 5-year pre-pandemic average. The dramatic drop in vacancy rates pushed national rent growth to a record high of 11% on a year-over-year basis in '21, made it a tough environment to sell advertising, but we still sold a lot of advertising. In the first quarter, '22 absorption moderated dramatically from 187,000 units 12 months ago to 54,000 units during the first 3 months of this year. 
 At the same time, deliveries of new units increased, resulting in the first quarter vacancy rates rising 10 basis points to 4.9%. Current projections for '22 show demand dropping to pre-pandemic levels with new rental unit deliveries expected to exceed demand. And vacancy is therefore expected to rise past 5% by the end of this year, resulting in more modest annual rent growth of about 6%, 7%. This is still elevated by historical standards, but we see the supply of new units continue to grow during the year in '23, which we expect will create excellent, high-value advertising opportunities for Apartments.com. 
 Search activity on Apartments.com continues to trend near record levels, indicating a robust spring and summer rental season. Traffic in the first quarter increased 13% over the first quarter of last year, which is the strongest first quarter traffic on record for the Apartments.com network. 
 Not only did traffic increase, but quality leads generated for advertising clients increased 18% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. Our sales team is doing a great job selling and renewing businesses at higher price levels, resulting in a cost per lead for the first quarter of '22 coming in at about the same level as it was in the first quarter of '21. 
 Apartments.com continues to attract more and more renters, while our market data indicates the traffic declined year-over-year for a number of our competitors. With tighter market conditions putting pressure on revenue for our smaller competitors, we believe that the marketing budgets in SEM of those competitors are shrinking and will negatively impact their traffic. We believe this will result in fewer leads for their advertising customers, which will make Apartments.com a more attractive advertising alternative. 
 In early April, we launched Apartments.com's most comprehensive marketing plan ever. Jeff Goldblum returns for his eighth year as the Apartminternet founder, Brad Ballflower, with great new TV and social video spots that play off of recent cultural headlines with themes such as billionaires going up in the space. Our ads also focus on what matters most to renters that want to add more space, change location or change lifestyle to fit their post-pandemic situations. 
 In total, we expect the campaign will deliver over 10 billion media impressions. We'll run 20,000 commercials on top prime time shows, premieres and finales as well as major sporting events. Importantly, we know now more than ever that renters are consuming media primarily through streaming video and audio platforms, a little less on Netflix recently. As such, we are doubling our investment in video-on-demand, streaming audio and social media with a huge presence on top platforms such as HBO Max, Paramount, Hulu, Peacock, YouTube, iHeartRadio, Spotify, Pandora and many others. 
 With the new campaign, Apartments.com will also connect with renters like never before through custom content and unique creative developed specifically for renters' favorite social and digital video platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Facebook. We plan to launch several new social series developed in partnership with top-tier influencers across all renting categories, including DIY projects, pet life, apartment tours, apartment living tips and tricks and more. 
 Our advertising is increasing in its effectiveness as we are able to deliver our highest first quarter levels of traffic and unaided brand awareness while proactively managing our spend below prior year levels. In the first quarter of this year, our field sales team delivered their highest net sales productivity since the end of 2020 with our mid-market sales team also having their highest productivity on record in the first quarter. So the sales teams are doing really quite well. I mean very impressive work there. 
 I believe our ability to once again meet safely with customers and prospects face-to-face is also fueling our sales success. In the first quarter of 2022, our field sales team conducted over 40,000 separate in-person meetings. 
 With a great first quarter to start the year in Apartments.com, I believe the combination of our leading brand position, an improving market environment, better pricing and a growing productive sales force puts Apartments.com in great shape, delivered double-digit revenue growth in the second half of this year. And the fact that we have Paige Forrest makes it a slam dunk. 
 LoopNet first quarter revenue was $54 million, up 11% over the prior year. We saw record traffic in the quarter with more than 11 million average monthly unique visitors to LoopNet network. March was our highest traffic month ever with 11.8 million unique visitors. 
 User engagement on LoopNet is also increasing with users reading more than 250,000 articles on LoopNet in January, another new high-water mark. The continued increase in users and engagement on LoopNet demonstrates the value of the marketplace, the quality of our content and the effectiveness of our marketing programs. 
 Our LoopNet marketing activities produced inbound sales leads up 76% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter '21. The Space for Dreams marketing campaign that we developed in '21 continues uninterrupted into '22. In the first quarter of '22, the campaign delivered an estimated 93 million impressions across linear TV, social media and direct digital channels. The Space for Dreams campaign runs through the end of September and is expected to deliver more than 400 million impressions. 
 I'm confident our marketing program this year will keep LoopNet top of mind with tenants and investors when they search for a space, which underpins our substantial competitive traffic advantage. We continue to increase our dedicated LoopNet sales force, and we added 25 new sales professionals so far this year. 
 Ten-X's revenue was up 42% year-over-year in the first quarter. Seasonally, the first quarter tends to be lower in terms of property transactions. However, this year, the value of properties brought to the platform was up over 90%. Ten-X sold approximately $575 million in assets in the first quarter of '22, the best first quarter performance in over 5 years. For the fifth quarter in a row, the critical trade rate, which is total assets sold as a percentage of total assets brought to the platform, came in an impressive 70%. 
 One of the successful strategies contributing to the sales growth is the new pricing structure we introduced a little over a year ago. The new tiered pricing model lowered the transaction fee on asset sales as the value of assets increased but preserved strong margins. As a result, in the first quarter of this year, the average size of assets sold in the platform increased 32%, with the value of the properties sold at $10 million or more increasing 4x to the prior year level. In addition, the volume of assets sold on the platform increased 37% in the first quarter of '22. Together, the property size and volume improvements account for almost 70% of the traffic -- of the revenue growth. 
 We continue to build out the Ten-X sales team with the number of sales reps increasing by 20% since the end of last year. Our goal is to grow the team by another 50% by the end of '22. We launched our Ten-X marketing program for '22 called Battle of the Bids in the first quarter. Battle of the Bids is a gamification of the Ten-X bidding process in which people can guess the price at which a real estate profit will be sold on the platform with a chance to win millions of dollars in cash prices. Our goal is to drive broad brand awareness and platform participation. The first round of competition was played during our April 11 to 13 Ten-X auction with 6,800 registered players participating. 
 Since we launched marketing for the first round, active web sessions on Ten-X are up 22%. The promotional campaign generated 7.3 million impressions in a little over a month. New Ten-X accounts are up 32% year-over-year in the first quarter. With the round 2 starting tomorrow, registered participants are already 30% higher than round 1. 
 Overall, we are well on our way to building a highly effective digital transaction capability with Ten-X that I believe will become the preeminent global digital trading platform. This year, we are on track to grow revenue by 20%. And we believe by the end of next quarter, we will have fully integrated the Ten-X platform into the CoStar environment, giving us additional scalability. 
 Our Residential business is performing very well to start the year. We're successfully growing subscription sales and revenue and building out the residential products vision we shared with you earlier. First quarter revenue in Residential was $18 million, an increase of 63% compared to the first quarter of 2021. It's a small number, but you have to start somewhere, and we see growth in the future. 
 Revenue from our Pro+ product increased approximately 60% year-over-year, while our Concierge Pro+ product was approximately 4x higher this year versus the first quarter of last year. The direct sales team selling our Pro+ product is delivering excellent results as our first quarter net new sales bookings for Pro+ subscription is up 120% over the first quarter '21. We intend to continue growing our Pro+ sales team to approximately 100 sales reps by the end of the year in order to increase our agent penetration and engagement on the Homesnap platform. 
 Our product design and development teams are building the product capabilities that will, for the first time, directly connect homebuyers and sellers to their agents, enabling great online collaboration. Using the "your listing, your lead" approach, we are building tools that will directly connect interesting buyers to selling agents along with complete agent directory for potential homebuyers to use in selecting the right agent for them. 
 Behind the scenes, we intend to relaunch the Homes.com website in June on top of a modern integrated technology platform. Although not directly visible to Homes.com users, this is an important step that brings the best technology for traffic scalability and speed to Homes.com. We are leveraging the success from Apartments.com and other high-performance marketplaces to make this possible. 
 Our research team is busy building the proprietary content around neighborhoods, schools and parks and other features that consumers told us are important to them when they're shopping for the best place to live. So far, we've produced hundreds and hundreds of videos with tens of thousands of more in the works. We believe this rich content will produce significant organic search results and will be highly informative and engaging to consumers as they research the best place to live. 
 Traffic to Homes.com improved significantly in the first quarter of '22, with monthly visitors growing 55% compared to the first quarter '21. Even more encouraging, site visits improved over 70% since we acquired Homes.com, increasing at a much faster rate than Apartments.com did during the same post-acquisition period. Unique visitors to our overall residential network, including both Homes.com and Homesnap, increased 125% from the first quarter of 2022 over the first quarter of '21. 
 We are preparing to roll out Citysnap at the end of this year as part of our arrangement with the Real Estate Board of New York. Citysnap will provide consumers a powerful home search app and website customized for New York City, along with connectivity to our Homesnap suite of tools for property agents. For the first time, New York renters and buyers and their brokers will have a single real-time source for all available listings in the city. 
 We have partnered with a leading New York advertising agency to develop a marketing campaign for Citysnap with messaging that will reinforce the unique joys of living in Manhattan and highlight how Citysnap addresses the pain points of finding a place to live in New York. You will soon see Citysnap all over New York City as we have designed our marketing plans to deliver hundreds of millions of media impressions across streaming video, audio, social and physical media. We anticipate millions of visits to Citysnap site and app as a result of our media campaign. 
 Overall, I'm very happy with the progress of our residential initiatives, and we remain on track for a full launch of the new Homes.com marketplace in '23. 
 Winding up by a quick look at the economy, the CRE economy. The office market does continue to struggle with vacancy rates at all-time highs, anemic absorption, rental rates at all-time real dollar lows. Sales volumes are low and cap rates are rising. It doesn't sound rosy, but our LoopNet product is well positioned to help owners and brokers reach tenants and buyers in this tough market. Ten-X is well positioned to help owners and lenders exit the investments they must exit in this tough market, and the new CoStar lender product is an excellent tool to help lenders navigate the risks they may encounter in this tough market. 
 The apartment market is beginning to cool with demand moderating, vacancies rising. Rent growth is still strong, but with new construction booming, rent growth is going to slow into next year with further increases in vacancy rates, which sets a stage for a strong sales environment for Apartments.com. 
 Retail leasing is rising as store openings are outpacing closures, allowing vacancy rates to compress to lower and lower levels. Retail property owners have much reason to remain confident as net absorption, rent growth and investment activity are building on momentum from last year. The national industrial vacancy rate fell to a record low in the first quarter, fueled by strong leasing activity as tenants rapidly expand their distribution networks to accommodate increasing consumer demand for faster home delivery. 
 Speculative construction continues to rise and competition for limited space is driving record rent growth. The hefty construction pipeline offers fertile ground for additional LoopNet revenue as more developers seek to maximize their marketing exposure during lease-up. We set some of our highest price points ever for LoopNet marketing in '21 and '22 for industrial speculative properties. The industrial market right now is white hot. 
 In the hospitality sector, leisure and weekend demand continue to act as the main drivers for the U.S. hotel sector recovery. Room rates are trending at an all-time high as occupancy and RevPAR are recovering. Business travel demand is gaining momentum. 
 So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, the man you all respect and rely on, Scott Wheeler. 
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. 
Andrew Florance: You're welcome, Scott. 
Scott Wheeler: Excellent rendition to the script this evening. So another really strong financial quarter. Key metrics, net new bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, all growing double digits, great start, and our outlook is improving. Now that's not bad considering that we're in a volatile economic environment. So it's great to have a high renewing subscription model to rely on when the global economy becomes a little less predictable. 
 So revenue grew 13% in the first quarter versus the first quarter of 2021 with 4 of our 6 service categories growing in the strong double digits. CoStar revenue grew 15% in the first quarter, continuing its growth acceleration and consistent with our guidance. For context, CoStar revenue grew 10% in the third quarter of last year, 13% in the fourth quarter of 2021, 15% in the first quarter of 2022, and we expect CoStar revenue growth of 17% in the second quarter of 2022. This is a trend I really like. We now expect full year 2022 revenue growth of 16% for CoStar, up from our prior expectation of 15%. 
 Multifamily revenue for the first quarter increased 6%, consistent with the fourth quarter last year and in line with our guidance. Revenue growth year-over-year is pretty much all price-driven as advertised property counts have moderated since the middle of last year, and ad level mix is a bit lower from the downgrades over the past few quarters, although in the recent quarter, the net upgrades have passed the net downgrades. So that's a positive sign for our outlook. We expect second quarter revenue growth to remain at 6%, and our full year revenue estimates remain unchanged at 8% to 9% range with double-digit growth expected in the second half of the year for multifamily. 
 LoopNet revenue grew 11% in the first quarter, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in our last call. Second quarter revenue is expected to grow 10%, and our full year 2022 outlook remains unchanged at 10% to 11%. 
 Revenue from Information Services grew 7% in the first quarter, also in line with our guidance. And for the second quarter, we expect revenue growth to approximate 8% as hospitality market conditions are improving. Full year expectation for Information Services has revised up slightly to the high end of our previous range at 9%. 
 Residential revenue increased 63% over the first quarter of last year. Revenue from products that are expected to be part of our long-term strategy, like Pro+ subscriptions, grew 62% in the first quarter on a like-for-like basis. Additionally, first quarter subscription revenue doubled versus the year ago quarter. Very good and positive momentum for our new sales force in the residential sector. Our full year 2022 revenue expectation remains unchanged at $70 million. 
 Other Marketplace revenue grew 31% in the first quarter of 2022, driven by the strong growth from Ten-X, and we expect revenue from these marketplaces to grow 20% in 2022 as we had easier comps in the first quarter of this year. 
 On to profitability. Our net income was $89 million in the first quarter, an increase of 20% from the first quarter of 2021, and our effective tax rate was 26% for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $178 million, a 12% year-over-year increase, $18 million above the high end of our guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% compared to 35% in last year's first quarter. 
 The outperformance in adjusted EBITDA compared to guidance was driven by lower personnel and marketing costs as well as a bit higher than projected revenue. Roughly 1/3 of the lower operating costs are timing-related with the rest flowing through to our increased guidance for 2022. We saw good productivity in our marketing costs, particularly as we leverage scale across our various platforms that are now marketing as we go into the new season. 
 Our sales force totaled approximately 870 people on March 31, an increase of roughly 45 heads from the end of last year. The largest sales force increases this quarter were in LoopNet, followed by multifamily and Ten-X. We're focused on expanding our sales resources in all of our businesses and have doubled our number of sales recruiters since the beginning of this year. 
 Our contract renewal rate was 91% for the first quarter of 2022, up from the 90% rate in the first quarter of last year and down slightly from the fourth quarter renewal rate of 92%. So this renewal rate fluctuated within this 90% to 92% range over really the last 5 quarters, and it changes slightly due to product mix and whether the growth rates of CoStar or Apartments are moving in different directions. The renewal rate for the first quarter of 2022 for customers who've been subscribers for 5 years or longer was a record 98%. Got to love that. 
 Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the first quarter of 2022, which is the highest rate since the middle of 2020. The improvement in subscription revenue concentration is primarily from more multifamily customers committing to annual agreements. 
 So for the outlook for 2022, we expect the full year revenue in a range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, an increase of approximately $5 million at the midpoint of the range, implying an annual growth rate of 11%. Organic growth, excluding the revenue runoff from the legacy Homes.com product is expected to be 12%. Second quarter 2022 revenue is expected to range from $529 million to $534 million, representing revenue growth of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. 
 Full year adjusted EBITDA for 2022 is expected to range from $585 million to $615 million, which is an increase of $15 million from our prior guidance, with $5 million of the improvement from revenue and the rest from cost efficiencies, primarily from leveraging our scale across the marketing spend, as I mentioned earlier. For the second quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $123 million to $128 million, indicating a margin of 24% at the midpoint during the typical high point of our marketing spend for the quarters. 
 Regarding our longer-term goals, for the great start to 2022 and our new residential investments progressing as planned, we remain confident in our ability to reach both the 2022 as well as the 2027 long-term financial goals that we announced at our last earnings call in February. 
 So before I turn the call back over to our operator for this much anticipated Q&A session, I would like to remind everyone, our question-asking audience, that you'll get one question and one question only. So I know that you've been thinking about it long and hard, and you're going to make this question count. 
 So with that, I will now turn the call back over to our operator to begin the questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. 
Keen Fai Tong: Diving into multifamily, it looks like you're starting to see stabilization in top line growth in the mid-single-digit range. Could you talk a little bit about your latest expectations for growth in the back half of the year and then for 2023 as you approach run rate? And then what apartment market conditions are necessary to achieve these targets? 
Scott Wheeler: Sure, George. Thanks for the question. So yes, we were encouraged with where we're going with multifamily. We expect in the second half that will be in double-digit growth rates. That's going to range between 10% to 14% as we move through the second half of the year. 2023, we haven't set any rates off into 2023. But as you can see, the quarterly trend is moving upward. That should set expectations that 2023 will be ahead of 2022. 
 Some of the things that we're seeing are more properties now advertising on the platform in March. So there's more properties being added than properties being taken away from the platform, and that's probably for the first time in the last 6 or 7 months. So that trend is encouraging. And the productivity of the sales force and the growth of the sales force are also encouraging advanced indicators on what we see in the second half. 
 The price execution has been very good, building every month as the sales force gets more and more comfortable with that program. So we think that we're on a good track. We've confirmed that in the first quarter and looking forward to the seasonally high -- typically seasonally high second quarter, really give us a more firm indicator on the second half of the year. 
Andrew Florance: I would also add that I was in Atlanta last week, and there were 25 people in the sales training class. So we are successfully adding a lot of additional incremental salespeople, and there's plenty for them to do because there are millions of prospects that we have yet to reach out to. 
 I think that there are clear indications in the outlook for the apartment market, and you're going to see the sort of ultra-low vacancy rates moderating, and I would be surprised if that's not what happened. So high deliveries of inventory and moderating vacancy rates or normalizing vacancy rates or slightly more than -- like within the standard deviation ranges are really what we expect and what we would want to have as an environment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. 
Peter Christiansen: Andy, can you -- or Scott, can you quantify at least on the multifamily side the mix between the different ad level packages, I guess platinum versus gold, all that kind of stuff? Just generally, where we are right now in that mix versus perhaps where normalized levels are. Just trying to get a sense of where we need to go to get back towards that normalized mix level. 
Scott Wheeler: Okay. Sure, Pete. Glad to help you with that. Our mix of ad platform levels have -- historically, the gold level platform is our largest mix. And it's been at about 40% since really the beginning of 2020. It remains roughly about there. You'll see diamonds have drifted down a couple of percentage points. They're just below 20%, so it hasn't moved a whole lot. The platinum is around 20%. That hasn't moved a whole lot. And you got a little bit more on the silvers, which has moved up a couple of points. 
 So really, the platforms have stayed relatively stable since the beginning of 2020 with just a slight shift between diamond and silvers, which as you know, we've addressed with the adjustment in our rate card so that if you do plan to move down the level, especially if you're a large platform player, then you're going to pay a lot higher price at lower levels now for moving off of those diamond platforms. So that's about where we're seeing the mix right now. 
Andrew Florance: I would also point out that another part of the story is the size of the ad sales force we've had is really working with our existing customer base as we add 50 or more incremental salespeople that are going to begin to be putting more focus on reaching out to folks that are not buying anything from us today, so as we grow share. And I do think firms like -- there's a lot of folks who are advertising on smaller platforms like software that we can offer a lot of advantage. I think we take a lot of share away from them. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. 
Jeffrey Meuler: I think we're continuing off that last line of thinking. But can you just give us a fuller update on kind of the down market Apartment's initiative? I guess you're kicking it off into the pandemic, and then you had a tough environment for a while, but it seems like we're maybe coming out of that. So just any update on how the down market initiative is performing? Any sort of strategic update since obviously Rent.com is not going to be utilized and you've since lost the Home strategy? 
Andrew Florance: Yes. So we -- I would just go back to going into the pandemic. We -- going into the pandemic, we were just building that mid-market team to go after that down market opportunity, i.e. 25 or less units down to single unit rentals. The price points we were getting were fantastic and -- on a per unit basis, and we were successfully selling. But with the pandemic, building an inside -- large inside sales team got much more difficult. 
 Again, last week, dropping in on the sales training in Atlanta, 25 people sitting in there in the sales training. We now have 7 recruiters going to 10. I believe we're going to see a lot of growth there. There is an unlimited -- effectively unlimited opportunity, so I'd expect for us to be able to start reporting some good progress there, and it's a very motivated group of salespeople that I got a chance to spend a fair amount of time with. So pretty optimistic there. 
Scott Wheeler: Yes. And when you look at the growth in advertised properties that took a pause, Jeff, in the middle of last year, they started growing pretty significantly in the first quarter of this year. And our mid-market sales team had their highest productivity level ever in the first quarter of 2022. So we stabilized a bit in the mid-2021 as the market adjusted, and now we're seeing growth pick up again in the under 100-unit section. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. 
Gustavo Gala: It's Gus stepping on for Andrew. Looking at resi -- so looking at resi, you guys are able to ramp it faster than like internally planned. Are you willing to spend more behind it this year? 
Andrew Florance: I think that it's going to be pretty predictable along the plan, the existing plan. We are engaged in a very ambitious scale software development effort, and that is not likely to go dramatically faster or slower than we anticipate as well as we're engaged in a scale collection of content. So there's well over 1,000 people working on the project right now. So it's going to be pretty predictable in 2022, I think. 
 Where you begin to get optional variability where you would respond to successes in the market and potentially accelerate would be later 2023, and that's where you're just playing with acceleration around number of salespeople or SEM or marketing in response to success. So I think it's going to be very predictable in 2022 and through Q1 of 2023 and possibly Q2 of 2023. But if there's a change in later 2023, it will be done with a lot of communication with our investors as to why we think it's a high IRR. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. 
Stephen Sheldon: On the -- maybe just a follow-up on the residential content investments and kind of 2 questions there. One, how is the cost efficiency for developing that content then relative to your expectations? And then two, I guess how far along are you now relative to what you planned for 2022 in terms of content breadth if there's a way to frame that? 
Andrew Florance: Yes, it's a good question. I think that we are -- in our plans for '22, because we were trying to go from 0 to 100 miles an hour, we preplanned a very aggressive compensation program for the folks we're bringing in to do it. So we already planned -- we didn't expect to be able to accelerate super rapidly at super high efficiency. We could achieve efficiency in out years, so we're sort of right in the line of as expected. And the initial efforts -- a lot of the initial efforts are around building the systems to manage collecting the content efficiently, and we're on track with that. So there's no unpleasant surprises that we're aware of. We're just tracking along expectations. And was there a second part of that question? No? Okay. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tomasello from KBW. 
Ryan Tomasello: Following up on the residential strategy, can you give us your thoughts around the various lawsuits that are going on in the residential market focused on industry practices around commissions and the role of realtors, agents and the MLS? How do you think that plays out? Does any of that work in your favor? And what's the bigger picture relevance for those lawsuits with respect to CoStar's long-term strategy in residential? 
Andrew Florance: So I think it's an interesting question. And for the first time in 5 years, we brought our General Counsel, and I don't think he's going to even comment. But the thing I would say is that we have not designed this like we are not in the business. We specifically have not designed Homes.com with a dependency on either the sell side or the buy side. There are a number of other U.S. residential real estate portals who work to monetize the buy side aggressively, and they rely on that dictated buyer split that is being attacked with some of these lawsuits. We're taking a completely different tech. 
 We are focusing on selling the house and trying to market the house as effectively as possible. And there are no lawsuits out there saying that people can't sell their homes. So it doesn't really impact us. I -- also, where we are looking at generating revenue from agents, we are completely agnostic to whether or not it's buy side or sell side. So I think we can sit back and watch these lawsuits develop. It's just an academic interest. It doesn't really impact us. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon from Needham. 
Mayank Tandon: Andy or Scott, I think one of you mentioned that the pricing impact was pretty much all of the multifamily this quarter, but just maybe more broadly your expectations on how much leverage now you have to increase pricing across the different product lines and how we should think about that impact versus growth from volumes or transactions or users. So pricing versus volume growth as we look out over the course of 2022. 
Andrew Florance: Well, we operate in highly competitive markets, and we have really no pricing leverage anywhere. But if we did, we are focusing on making sure that all of our product managers and leads -- sales leads understand that in a highly inflationary environment, not to maintain price appreciation is to decrease your pricing. So we are keeping that out there, and we seem to be able to able to achieve pricing increases along those objectives of being mindful of inflation and perhaps a little bit more. 
 Scott, you watch this pretty closely. Do you want to... 
Scott Wheeler: Yes. I think that's been our primary focus this year, is to make sure all of our platforms are keeping a close eye on our -- on the inflation numbers and then as our products annualize their contracts that we move our price up on the inflation curve, which is always part of the contracts that we enter into with customers. 
 In addition to that, as we go into each of our platforms every year, like CoStar, for example, where we're adding lender, we've added hospitality, we've added CMBS data, we build out great value feature sets. We try and keep our annual renewals outside of inflation to a low modest few percentage points. So our customers always feel value ahead of where prices move for us. 
 But certainly, you'll see overall that the percent from pricing will move up to more of about probably half of the revenue growth in general as in the past. It's typically about 1/3 in general, and the rest coming from volume and then people selecting to buy more and more products or increasing the mix of what they buy. So that's just a rough estimate, but I can give you some sense that it will play a little more important role, especially while we're in an inflationary environment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC. 
Ashish Sabadra: So pretty good momentum on the Pro+ and Concierge Pro+ products. Again, I understand it's a smaller base, but good traction there. I was wondering if you could comment on the feedback like. Where is the penetration for both the Pro+ and the Concierge Pro+ product? And also just the slowing home market and the tightening home market -- residential market, how does that affect your ability to sell in that market? 
Andrew Florance: Sure. Thank you for the question. One of the wonderful things about being at the very early stages of entering the market with sub 1% penetration is contraction of the market, you can't feel it, like you're just -- you're moving into the market. So we're not feeling anything there. 
 In the -- in terms of Pro+ and Concierge, the big factor there is it's -- we believe it's a really solid product that the agents like and regard highly. And when we acquired Homesnap, the biggest limitation or challenge they faced is they effectively had no salespeople. So by introducing salespeople and reaching out to realtors and telling them about what we had to offer, we were able to successfully sell the product. So the primary limiter is just the number of salespeople we bring in. 
 The market is massive. And it's -- it could be a decade, and you wouldn't be able to penetrate the market fully. So -- and there's a balance between Pro+ and Concierge we're watching. I personally like -- both have advantages for us. Concierge has bigger dollars, but I think Pro+ has more strategic value. When a customer goes and when a realtor buys Pro+, they tend to use our platform dramatically more. We want them engaged as we release enhanced version of Homes.com. They're already in our environment regularly, and thereby, they're more likely to use our environment to collaborate with their buyers and their sellers. 
 So it has -- Pro+ has a smaller revenue impact per unit. It's got a huge opportunity because the units are massive, but it has high strategic value. Concierge is fascinating. Concierge is fascinating because it's higher dollars, and it is a product where very often we are selling for hundreds of price point ASP of hundreds of dollars a month marketing opportunities to the agents for marketing the properties, which is the products we want to be focusing on down the road. So ultimately, you're asking me which of my children I like more. I like them both the same. 
Scott Wheeler: Now let me add some from a revenue projection. You may recall in the last call, we talked about the new sellers we're bringing on in the residential world are focused on Pro+, and so we are consciously not trying to grow the Concierge revenue on a dollar basis as we shift more and more sellers into Pro+ because Andy said the stickiness of the Pro+, the agent engagement is higher in the Pro+ product, and we are better off longer term doing that. 
 So that's why you don't see as dramatic a revenue growth in our annual outlook as you'll see a mixing down in Concierge, the higher-priced product as we build the sales force that's bringing in more subscriptions on the Pro+. So more about that as we go forward, but that's what will play out in the financial dynamics. 
Andrew Florance: But John Mazur keeps selling the Concierge. 
Scott Wheeler: I know. It's hard not to. The agents really like it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Goodwin from JMP. 
Joe Goodwin: I just wanted to ask about the new modern integrated technology platform for Homes.com. And then I guess just kind of what's going on there, what advantages that will launch you. And then any plans to actually connect the Homes.com data and port that into the CoStar back end so that will be available to your CoStar customers? 
Andrew Florance: Yes. So it's a multistage process. The first stage is when you look at the Homes.com we acquired, it wasn't the high-performance environment you needed to be scalable up to 100 million uniques. Speed, performance, responsive mobile, all those things are essential to being able to build your traffic objectives and to get the SEO rankings you want. So what we're doing in Phase 1 is we are using the Homesnap back end, which is pretty robust. We are scaling that from single-serve to multiple -- with the cloud base that you can scale it infinitely in AWS. And then we're using the Apartments.com front-end tools against the Homesnap back-end tools, and that is our fastest path to market with high-performance scalability. 
 After we release that version, we're going to come back and we're going to migrate the Homesnap back-ends into the -- what we call our enterprise back-ends, which is the core CoStar Group back-ends, which Apartments.com and LoopNet and the other systems work off of. Once we do that, the data will all then reside in the platform that is connected into CoStar. And subject to the license agreements with the MLSs and the use provisions, we would then be able to make that robust residential data or some of the Homesnap functionality available in the CoStar product to the people that were properly licensed. So there's a 3 -- I think that's a 3-step process there, but it will keep our development teams stably employed forever. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Campbell from Stephens Inc. 
John Campbell: Congrats on a great quarter. So on the incremental $100 million to $120 million of resi investment spend you guys have kind of planned for this year, how much of that hit in the quarter? And then also if you're able to share just the breakdown of that spend across content, software and marketing and maybe how that's going to look for the balance of the year. 
Andrew Florance: It's all yours to comment. 
Scott Wheeler: Sure. So the incremental spend this year was $200 million to $220 million. So we had called about $210 million. $110 million of that was the content generation. About $65 million or so was for the marketing, and the rest was from technology spend as well as product and some other infrastructure that went into that. There wasn't a major amount of that timed in the first quarter, somewhere in the $10 million to $15 million range, probably incremental. Maybe it's a little higher than that. But the ramp-up really starts to come in the second quarter as we're adding the resources to the content collection. 
 There's marketing that will pick up in the last quarter of the year, third and fourth quarter of the year as we get closer to launching. So it's heavily phased into the back half of the year. So really in the first quarter, it was really shifting resources. They're both product and product development resources over from our other businesses and some research folks. So not a whole lot in the first part of the year. Most will be coming in the last 3 quarters. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Andrew Florance. 
Andrew Florance: Well, thank you for joining us today, Gene, as a special guest host. And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our first quarter '22 earnings call. We've come out of the gates this year with a real strong momentum across our commercial property platforms along our exciting, new investment opportunities in residential market and our European potential. We look forward to speaking to you all again in the second quarter call in July 26 at the same time and the same medium. Until then, stay safe, and thank you very much for participating. And thank you very much for any analyst who said great quarter. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Bill Warmington, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Blue. Good evening and thank you all for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2021 results of the CoStar Group.

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Bill. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Total revenue for the full year 2021 was $1.94 billion, which is a 17% year-over-year growth rate and above the high end of our guidance range given in late October. Fourth quarter revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $507 million, crossing through an important milestone of a $2 billion run rate for the first time. December 2021 was our best sales month ever. November, December and January were three of our four strongest sales months ever. Net bookings of $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 were a new all-time high for us, up 37% year-over-year and 43% sequentially. Our trailing 12-month bookings in the fourth quarter was $217 million, growing 18% year-over-year. This is a significant acceleration from the trailing 12-month bookings growth of 6% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2021. Our profit performance in 2021 was also very strong. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $647 million, an increase of 17% and 27% above the high end of our guidance. 2021 was a solid year of growth and expansion for CoStar Group. We made significant investments in the CoStar product, and our unified platform overcame significant overhead apartment market challenges Apartments.com. And we expanded our LoopNet and Ten-X businesses and established a solid foundation in the residential property sector. Our addressable market continues to grow every year and our estimation now approaches $100 billion TAM globally. A couple of weeks ago, I ran across our TAM estimate from the year 2003 and that indicated a global TAM of $1.6 billion. At that point, our total revenue was under $75 million. What a difference we've seen in 20 years is our revenue is now bigger than we estimated the total TAM global to be into 2003. It took us 16 years to go from 0 to $100 million revenue run rate in 2003, another 14 years to get to $1 billion annualized revenue in 2017 and only four years to surpass $2 billion revenue run rate, $5 billion here we come. CoStar revenue was $723 million for the full year 2021, up 9%. CoStar's year-over-year revenue growth accelerated throughout 2021. We started the year with a 4% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2021 and it climbed until we exited at 13% in the fourth quarter. The strength is coming from a combination of record sales rep productivity, continued product upgrades, price escalations on subscription renewals and strong renewal rates. Net bookings in the fourth quarter of 2021 grew 3x versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and matched our all-time high quarter in the third quarter of 2021. The CRE sales team is firing on all cylinders, delivering all-time high productivity in 2021, up almost 40% versus 2020. In 2021, we began upgrading the 18,000 accounts, who were using subsets of CoStar's full product offering. This program is very popular with our customers. And by the end of January, we have converted about 5,700 accounts to the full global CoStar product. Our original estimate was that the upgrade program would contribute $30 million to $40 million in incremental revenue over a 12- to 18-month period. The adoption rate, however, has been stronger than we expected. So we expanded the number of accounts to upgrade to include appraisers, owners, government agencies and many others. This raises the number of upgradable accounts from 18,000 to 21,000. As a result, we believe our original estimate that the upgrade opportunity would generate $30 million to $40 million is likely not to exceed $50 million. After having suspended price increases on CoStar subscription renewals during the pandemic, we restarted normal renewal rate increases in the third quarter of this year. Even at these higher price points from annual renewals and upgrades, clients continue to see strong value in the CoStar product and we see that in multiple metrics. Our accelerating revenue growth, for example, is coming from a combination of both volume and price. We're finding that as we upgrade accounts, we're often increasing their number of users and our user count is now over 170,000 subscribers. In addition, our renewal rate for CoStar remains very strong, 94% in the fourth quarter of 2021, well above the historic average of 92.4%. Our sales team has put a significant effort into strengthening our relationships with our clients. We see that effort pay off as our net promoter score has been increasing and as it does, so does our renewal rate. We believe that the launch of our new lender product on February 8 sets up another long-term growth driver for CoStar. Feedback, while the products in beta has been extremely positive, it's a truly revolutionary product that reverses the traditional flow of data in the industry. In the past, most lenders pulled data manually from multiple sources. CoStar lender, in contrast, automatically connects their loan portfolio to CoStar's industry-leading research market analytics and our proprietary Compass credit default model. The Compass credit default model is the most mature in the industry. And this makes this solution unique as the best source for portfolio surveillance, concentration risk, stress testing, current expected credit loss, CECL, supporting loan originations and underwriting. So we're very excited about this new product. We have a dedicated and trained sales team that will be focused on upgrading CoStar's over 1,000 existing lender clients and engaging 6,000 other prospective lenders across the industry. With FASB's second round effective date for CECL fast approaching in January of 2023, we feel our solution is well timed. There are literally thousands of institutions in the U.S. without an answer for CECL in place with this deadline approaching. Because CoStar offers lenders a range of solutions, it positions us favorably versus the competition. We continue to invest in long-term growth opportunities for CoStar and that includes international expansion. To support our growth across Central Europe, we've begun hiring managers and teams of photographers for Spain, France and Germany. These teams will be supporting both our CoStar and marketplace assets as we begin the process of deepening our industry data in the largest European markets. Overall, I feel very good about our growth momentum for CoStar and expected revenue – growth in 2022 to move above the historical 12% to 14% growth range to around 15% year-over-year. I believe CoStar has a $10 billion global market opportunity in which we are less than 10% penetrated today. Apartments.com sales bookings rebounded sharply in the fourth quarter, climbing $20 million over the third quarter driven by improved sales execution and price realization in the face of a continued ultra-low vacancy market. Apartments.com generated $675 million of revenue in 2021, up 13% year-over-year. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6%, in line with our guidance of mid-single digits growth. 2021 was a good year for Apartments.com franchise. Average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 25 million, up 17% year-over-year. That is 2.5x rent past average monthly unique visitors in the fourth quarter of 2021, 10x apartment lists, 17% higher than Zillow's rental network and 11x Zumper. Leads delivered by Apartments.com grew 46% in 2021 and 27% in the fourth quarter. To keep this marketing momentum going, in the first quarter of 2022, we will be releasing a new ad campaign featuring Gold Bloom in five new TV spots and eight new social video campaigns. When you see these new campaigns, I think you'll – these new spots, I think you'll agree with me that is some of the best work our team has produced to date. I look forward to having them out there. 2021 was a great year for our Multifamily customers with record rent growth of 11.3% and a vacancy rate of only 4.6%, the lowest ever recorded. 2022 is expected to have rent growth of 6.5%, which would be the second best year on record with higher but still very low vacancy. The strong industry backdrop for apartment owners, combined with a superior advertising value demonstrate their site traffic and leads, positioned Apartments.com to execute on our new pricing strategy. As a result, cost per lead has begun to improve and we saw a significant improvement in net bookings in the fourth quarter of 2021 over the third quarter of 2021. Client losses have been minimal. The strong net bookings momentum, combined with modest improvements in the macro backdrop, gives us confidence that Multifamily will be able to return to double-digit organic revenue growth in the second half of 2022. We estimate Multifamily is a $7 billion revenue opportunity for us in the U.S. And we believe that Apartments.com is well positioned to pursue that opportunity through unit penetration and demonstrated pricing power. 2021 was a very successful year for the LoopNet franchise. Full year revenue of $208 million in 2021 grew 15%. The Space for Dreams campaign delivered 2.2 billion media impressions in 2021. Unique visitors globally grew 22% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the LoopNet CRE network traffic was 10x the level of the network nearest competitor. Signature ad growth continued to be very strong, up 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to focus on expanding our sales distribution strength and are currently very close to our year-end 2021 sales headcount goal of 50 and continue to aggressively recruit salespeople for LoopNet. In 2022, we plan to continue the Space for Dreams campaign, support the industry and driving exposure for our advertisers. We expect LoopNet's revenue growth to continue in that 10% range for the first half of 2022 while we continue to build out a dedicated LoopNet sales team. I feel confident that we have never had stronger leadership, a better product road map, more innovative marketing, stronger technology and better traffic than we have now. That's why I believe that LoopNet is well positioned for strong growth going forward. We remain excited that LoopNet has the industry-leading position in what we believe is in the early days of a $4 billion to $5 billion revenue opportunity. Ten-X had a strong year in 2021, the division's first full calendar year as part of CoStar Group. Ten-X sold $2.2 billion in gross merchandise value in 2021, up 47% year-over-year and the company's best since 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Ten-X sold $727 million in gross merchandise value, up 39% year-over-year, the company's best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2015. Full year 2021 revenue of $57 million grew 7% year-over-year. While total sales in the platform is climbing, it does not translate as quickly to revenue because we've lowered our fees to drive more high-margin volume and to play an industry role at greater scale. We're investing in significant site and process automation to be able to process these higher volumes at high margins. Ten-X continues to sell more and close more. Trade rate, which is total assets sold as a percentage of the total assets brought to the platform, has improved from 54% in 2019 to 66% in 2020 and 73% in 2021. And this has happened while we've been expanding the buyer base significantly. We estimate that Ten-X is a $4 billion revenue opportunity. To pursue that TAM, we're aggressively growing Ten-X' sales team currently up to 54 people. These new salespeople have been incredibly productive. In the first quarter 2021, new sales reps didn't add any new deal – didn't add any deals in the quarter. In the second quarter, they delivered 5% of the deals. In the third, they delivered 20%. In the fourth, they delivered almost a third of the deals. In addition, the research team in Richmond, which is in constant contact with brokers and principals, who can benefit from Ten-X, has begun to contribute deals to the Ten-X pipeline. We've opened round one of the Battle of Bids 2022, a gamification of the Ten-X bidding process in which people can guess the price at which a real estate property will be sold with a chance to win up to $3 million in cash prizes. Our goal is to drive broad brand awareness and platform participation. We think we've created a really fun gamification of the CRE sales process that will bring the Ten-X story live and engage tens of thousands of key prospects. 2021 was our first full year in the residential property sector. We generated $75 million of revenue. Homesnap revenue grew 52% year-over-year on a pro forma basis in 2021 driven by our larger direct sales force of 60 people. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Homesnap grew registered users by 12% year-over-year to 786,000 agents and as Homesnap Pro Plus paying subscribers grew 29% year-over-year to 68,000. Our acquisition of Homes.com in May of 2021 was very popular with agents as we implemented a your listing, your lead product approach and double the site traffic year-over-year in the fourth quarter 2021. That's right. We doubled the site traffic in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sounds familiar. Our strategy for transforming this massive TAM into revenue involves three phases: grow, monetize and scale. By grow, I mean, first, we're going to focus on increasing traffic and engaging buyers and sellers in our platform. By monetize, I mean we'll begin to introduce paid ads, which increase visibility for the clients and provide enhanced product features. And by scale, I mean moving into the phase where we stratify ad offerings to provide additional flexibility for agents and continue introducing more product features. Phase 1, growing traffic is our focus today. We have a track record of success in building organic SEO in our marketplaces, including Apartments.com, LoopNet, Realla, BizBuySell, Belbex and Lands of America and more. How do we do it? By building easy-to-use technology with sound SEO structures and with features and content to people value. For Homes.com, that means building a system that breaks down the wall between real estate agents and home buyers. 93% of homebuyers shop for their home on the Internet, and 90% of homebuyers use an agent to help find a home. Agent and buyers need to share information and feedback about home listings, but that's difficult today because they operate in two separate essentially closed and disconnected systems. Agents use their local MLS, which buyers have limited or no access to. Buyers use various real estate portals, but those portals are generally trying to get those buyers to use the portals small group of agents. So they're not effectively open buyer-agent collaboration tools across the industry. In fact, in essence, the structure was designed specifically to prevent transparency and collaboration. After watching hundreds of hours of interviews and focus groups, I can tell you that the thing that consumers and agents want that they're not getting and that what we can provide is collaboration. Homesnap is going to change that by enabling agents and buyers to share listings and feedback about those listings. By empowering agents with professional collaboration tools, we think it's possible to bring millions of buyers into our platform. The other takeaway from our interviews with consumers and agents is they want to be able to research the neighborhoods and parks that are important to them when they're considering a new home. We'll be creating powerful and professionally produced rich media and content of neighborhoods, parks and condo buildings across the United States. The other thing that Homes.com will do is support your listing, your lead by enabling potential homebuyers to easily contact the listing agent at no cost that agent. We believe that signees free leads to listing agents will increase the usage of Homes.com and Homesnap by all agents and provide a dramatically better user experience for buyers out there shopping. We expect Phase 1 of the product will be ready to go at the end of 2022, with a full launch in the first quarter of 2023. That said, you won't need to wait until end of 2022 to see our residential strategy in action. You will see a microcosm of our residential strategy when we launched Citysnap in New York in July. In October, we announced a partnership with the Real Estate Board of New York to create the first ever consuming facing – consumer-facing search website and mobile app for New York City's residential listing service. Similar to Homes.com, Citysnap will connect potential buyers and renters with listing agents consistent with our your listing, your lead philosophy and make collaboration possible through access to Homesnap's suite of tools. It will also feature promoted listings for residential real estate for the first time, similar to what we do with Apartments.com and many other real estate portals in other countries do. We believe that residential is a huge opportunity for CoStar Group. So enlarged, in fact that we believe our residential revenue will one day eclipse the revenue we generate in the commercial property sector. We estimate the U.S. opportunity for residential is $72 billion, and the global opportunity is $210 million, not $200 billion, $210 billion, 3x the U.S. opportunity. We believe that we can grow our residential revenue to $1 billion over the next five to seven years as part of our new long-term revenue goal of $5 billion in revenue by the end of 2027. At that scale, we would expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to be at or above our five-year target of 40% based on the success of similar residential marketplace businesses around the world. In order to achieve this goal, we plan to increase our level of investment in the residential business by approximately $200 million in 2022. The majority of this investment is funded by the significant cash generation of our existing business as we still expect to generate over $605 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2022, net of that residential investment. I'm excited to make significant progress this year and believe we have a unique opportunity to add another $1 billion revenue platform plus to our portfolio. In December, we announced plans to build a two-building 750,000 square foot corporate campus by James River in Richmond, Virginia to complete – be completed by 2024. Richmond is a vibrant growing affordable city with a great quality of life and 10 colleges and universities in the area that are both our research partners and our talent pool feeder. At CoStar Group and in Richmond, we are proud to employ amazing people who create and provide the best products, information, analytics and marketplaces that power the real estate industry. We strive to set the standard for accuracy and precision in everything we do because our clients rely on this data to conduct hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions. This type of exacting standard requires discipline, determination, commitment. And people of CoStar Group take great pride in their ability to deliver at this level. We provide our people with world-class industry training, enable them to advance professionally and enjoy long rewarding careers with CoStar Group. It does involve in measuring our performance and our work and having KPIs like any organization should have. Like any company, we have people who decide demands of our environment is not for them, and that's fine. For most who choose to leave, they're able to leverage the CoStar Group fundamental training, go on to enjoy productive careers in commercial real estate in other industries or continue their education. The real estate industry attrition rate in 2021 was 32.8%, but our attrition was slightly higher at 36.6%, about 300 basis points or so. The key difference between CoStar Group and the rest of the industry is that we achieved a 99% employee vaccination rate, and our employees have returned to working safely back in the office. As you know, that's very rare. Our staff is more productive back in the office. Collaboration, innovation is stronger. And training is much more effective. We do have a tiny vocal minority of disgruntled former employees who do not want to return to work. But despite that, we would take the same responsible long view direction again. Now that we're back in the office, our attrition rate has returned to normal, and over the past few months has, in fact, settled below the industry average. As hard as it was to return to the office, we're glad we've done it and feel for the companies that still have to cross that challenging bridge. We continue to believe that Richmond is a great center of excellence from which to grow our talent employee base that is supporting the real estate industry around the U.S. and across the world. Earlier today, we published our first sustainability report, which you can find in the Investor Relations section of the CoStar Group website. It's a very exciting piece. Thank you, Bill. At CoStar Group, we're committed to supporting ESG principles both inside and outside of our company. Inside CoStar Group, we have quietly been a leader in sustainability for decades, converting our fleet of nearly 200 research vehicles from gasoline to hybrid and then eventually to electric. We select LEED certified or ENERGY STAR rated buildings for most of our 800 – I'm sorry, our 80-plus offices and reducing total annual data center energy consumption despite significant company growth. Outside of CoStar Group, we help millions of consumers and real estate professionals achieve their sustainability goals. We pioneered creating transparency around building energy consumption when we were the first to widely publish building rate energy ratings. The CoStar information analytics product provides all subscribers with data in green rated buildings so they can identify locations that are ENERGY STAR bream and LEED certified. In addition, we funded the Journal of Sustainable Real Estate to support academics who study the value of building and investing in sustainable real estate. My colleagues and I have authored economic articles analyzing financial benefits from building and leasing and sustainable buildings. And those papers have been recognized with Best Paper Awards. The United Nations estimates that buildings and construction account for 36% of global final energies and 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. We believe CoStar Group is part of the solution to that problem, and we're focused on that. Our Apartments.com, Homes.com, LoopNet and Lands marketplaces enabled people all over the world to digitally visit properties for lease or sale without the environmental impact of physically driving to them. As you're aware, the economic recovery persists, but concerns about the virus inflation, the prospect of raising interest rates way on the near-term outlook. Supply constraints and labor shortages are also prevalent, which is further challenging business operations, driving costs and prices higher. As a result, consumers are facing decades high inflation, which is weighing on sentiment and potential spending. But in an inflationary environment, real estate can be a safe haven. In hospitality, leisure demand continues to drive the U.S. hotel recovery. Key metrics, including rooms, sold, occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are all either at or slightly above pre-pandemic levels, which is great news. Business travel, meanwhile, remains constrained as conferences are hampered by the latest variant of the coronavirus. Transaction volume ended the year at record levels, a signal of investors' long-term optimism for hospitality's recovery. In retail, strong consumer spending continues to support a resurgent retail environment. Foot traffic in physical locations has rebounded, especially in open-air shopping centers. Not surprising. Retailers have responded to the increase in consumer spending, and leasing volume is back to pre-pandemic levels. Notably, store openings outpaced store closures, helping to drive net absorption to its highest level since 2017. As a result, rents grew by 2.8%, the strongest pace seen in over a decade. Headwinds for the sector do remain, including waning fiscal support and higher inflation, supply chain disruption, labor shortages as well as an overhang of retail supply in certain segments. In industrial, that sector continues to benefit from the boom in consumer spending and the heightened need for enhanced supply chain networks. Expansions among e-commerce and big-box logistics firms continue to fuel record leasing activity, which is up 60% from pre-pandemic levels. Despite a record amount of speculative supply under construction, there's little risk of overbuilding given such strong demand. Vacancy hit a record low of 4.2%, propelling rent growth to a record 8.6%. In the office sector, uncertainty is still the prevailing theme of the sector. But after two straight quarters of improving leasing activity and slight positive net absorption, the national office market has started to stabilize were showing signs of stabilization and is likely in the early stages of recovery. However, significant headwinds and questions remain. The glut of sublet space remains a drag on the office markets recovery, though office users are increasingly turning to sublet leases for their space needs. It's still a tenant market. And while we've seen marginal increases in occupancy and space rents, such an improvement masks the higher concessionary environment, which is weighing on owner revenue. LoopNet could help those owners get a great lease now. The national multifamily market is expected to normalize in 2022, but the sector remains in historically strong position. Search activity at Apartments.com reached record levels in 2021, thanks to pent-up demand and regional shifts in migration in favor of Sunbelt markets. Record-setting demand is pushing vacancy rates to new lows. In turn, multifamily owners and managers are benefiting from record setting rent growth. Developers are working to deliver new product to meet unrelenting demand, especially in the Southeast. Commercial real estate investment across the board is hitting record levels led by unquenchable interest in multifamily and industrial assets. Retail and office volume is making traction approaching pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, volume was up in virtually every major metropolitan area. Pricing is trending higher in all property types. Distressed sales remain a small portion of overall activity, underscoring the prevailing health of the CRE industry. At this point, I’m going to turn the call over to our brilliant Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Excellent. Thank you, Andy.
Andy Florance: You’re welcome.
Scott Wheeler: I thought I’ve achieved a brilliant category today. Hope you think so after reading all these numbers. Certainly appreciate the comments and the great performance of the business in 2021. And obviously, it sounds like there’s no shortage of great opportunities ahead of us. Actually, I particularly enjoyed your throwback charts that you sent me from that 2020 sales conference when you have that itty-bitty TAM from 20 years ago of $1.6 billion. That had grown to – in 2016, when I joined, it was $6 billion we thought it was at that point. And now only five years later, we’re talking about $100 billion TAM size. So I think that’s pretty amazing. Anyway, enough of that giant global TAM mumbo jumbo, let’s talk some financials. So fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA results were better than expected, both ahead of our consensus. $4 million ahead for revenue and $28 million beat on profit. That was a great way to end the year. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, demonstrating the strong operating leverage inherent in our business. Our overall organic revenue growth rate was 11% for 2021, continuing a trend of 10 straight years of double-digit or greater organic revenue growth. CoStar revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year of 2021, in line with our previous guidance. Our many product enhancements and our successful shift to a global CoStar platform has resulted in increased demand and improved pricing. We anticipate that this positive growth trend will continue and expect both first quarter and full year 2022 revenue growth of 15% for CoStar. Multifamily revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year of 2021, also in line with the guidance we provided on our last call. As Andy mentioned, we saw Multifamily sales levels improved sequentially in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2021, although we’re not quite back yet to the level of sales we generated in the early part of 2021. Accordingly, we expect revenue growth rates to remain in the mid-single digits in the first half of 2022 for Multifamily before improving to double-digit growth rates in the second half of 2022. Full year growth rates for revenue in Multifamily should be around 8% to 9% for the full year of 2022. LoopNet revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year of 2021. Our CoStar sales team continues to sell an amazing amount of CoStar. That results in less sales of LoopNet at the lower end of our expectations as we build out our dedicated LoopNet sales team. Regardless, we’ll still grow LoopNet revenue double digits even with a smaller sales team. For 2022, we expect LoopNet revenue growth in the low double digits fluctuating around the 10% to 11% range throughout the year. Admittedly, this is a cautious outlook until our new dedicated sellers ramp up to full production later in 2022. Information services revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year of 2021, in line with our guidance. We expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits in the first half of 2022, improving to the low double digits in the second half of the year as conditions improve in our hospitality industry. Overall, we expect 2022 revenue for information services to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year. Our residential business delivered $21 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021, slightly ahead of our guidance, with nearly all of the revenue coming from Homesnap products as we complete the wind down of the legacy Homes.com revenue. Homesnap’s pro forma revenue growth was more than 60% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For 2022, we expect residential revenue to be around $70 million, representing growth of approximately 15% year-over-year after adjusting for the runoff of Homes.com product revenues. As we move into 2022, we’ve identified specific residential products that are expected to be part of our long-term growth strategy. These products include the Homesnap Pro Plus agent subscription, Homesnap listing ads and Homesnap Concierge Pro Plus lead management subscriptions, all of which, in aggregate, generated revenue of $55 million or 70% of the 2021 residential revenue. These continuing strategic products are expected to grow around 25% in 2022. By the end of the year, these products are expected to represent over 95% of the residential revenue. Other marketplace revenue was $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, well ahead of our guidance estimate of $32 million to $33 million, on the strength of a big finish to the year for our Ten-X platform. In 2022, we expect continued strong growth from Ten-X, along with our lands and businesses for sale marketplaces, all of which are expected to grow around 20% for the year. In total, our other marketplace sector is expected to achieve revenue growth of 20% in 2022, which compares favorably to the 10% pro forma revenue growth rate we had in 2021. Net income was $93 million in the fourth quarter and $293 million for the full year of 2021. Our effective tax rate was 30% for the fourth quarter and 28% for the full year. Included in this effective tax rate for 2021 were onetime increases, primarily from international tax restructuring that will support our future growth. Without these restructurings, our effective tax rate would have been approximately 24% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Let’s cover a few performance metrics, starting with our net new sales bookings. We achieved $67 million of net new bookings in the fourth quarter and $217 million for the full year. Just like to say that again, but Andy covered all that cool stuff. And our record sales level for the quarter, so I will...
Andy Florance: $217 million.
Scott Wheeler: $217 million, that’s great. Our sales force totaled approximately 825 people at the end of the year, and they certainly had an exceptionally productive fourth quarter with that record sales result. The fourth quarter number is down approximately 25 compared to the third quarter of 2021 as a result of attrition in the Homes.com sales team that joined us in mid-2021. With increased confidence in our ability to train new sellers and visit our customers in person this year, our 2022 outlook includes expansion plans across all of our major sales teams. In January of 2022, we added over 35 new sellers to the ranks, so we’re off to a strong start. Our contract renewal rate was 92% for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2021, unchanged from the third quarter of 2021. The current renewal rate is 200 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2020, with both CoStar and LoopNet improving year-over-year. Renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 97%, up 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020 and consistent with the second and third quarters of this year. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 77% for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2021, slightly below the fourth quarter of 2020, but slightly higher than the third quarter of this year. These modest fluctuations are a result of improvements in Multifamily, along with increased residential and LoopNet signature ad revenue, which tend to have shorter duration subscription contracts. Now for our 2022 outlook. We expect 2022 revenue to range from $2.145 billion to $2.165 billion, an increase of approximately $210 million at the midpoint of the range, implying an annual growth rate of 11%. Organic growth, excluding the revenue runoff from those legacy Homes.com products, is expected to be around 12%. Before I cover the 2022 adjusted EBITDA outlook and investments, I’d like to highlight the exceptional results we continue to see in our commercial real estate focused product areas, which includes CoStar, Multifamily, LoopNet, Information Services and our other marketplace businesses. A few years back, at the end of 2018, we set ambitious growth goals to reach $3 billion in run rate revenue by the end of 2023 and 40% adjusted EBITDA margins for that year. As a reminder, our $3 billion in run rate revenue goal was comprised of both organic revenue growth of 12% to 14% per year, approximately $600 million to $700 million of new revenue from acquisitions. So how have we performed against these goals? Well, with regards to the organic revenue growth, our performance is right on track in that 12% to 14% revenue growth range for the years 2019 through our 2022 outlook. This highlights the strength and resiliency of our product portfolio as we certainly did not anticipate the significant pandemic revenue slowdown in CoStar in 2020 or the current low vacancy market environment in Multifamily that impacts the growth of that business. Regarding acquisition-related revenue, we added a little over $200 million in acquired revenue since 2018. In that time, we’ve certainly passed on deals that many times that amount given what I consider to be unrealistic valuations and the difficulty of acquiring in a remote work environment. By my estimation, we could have spent around $4 billion to $6 billion of capital to acquire the level of revenue we had assumed in our targets. But rather than chase deals at those high prices, we elected to forego a number of opportunities and focus organically, which currently provides a much better return currently for our shareholders. With regards to our profit target of 40% adjusted EBITDA in 2023, we now expect to achieve that goal one year ahead of schedule and are forecasting 40% adjusted EBITDA for 2022 in the commercial real estate focused product areas. As we’ve either accomplished or on track with our current long-term goals, we believe it’s time to establish new long-range goals as the old goals don’t include our recent expansion into the residential property market or the great opportunity we see there. I will get to the new goals in just a minute. So our adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2022 is comprised of two important components. One is the cash generation, and the second is deploying that capital for our growth investments. First, to cover cash generation, we expect to generate approximately $170 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from the 12% organic revenue growth forecast. This added profit reflects approximately an 80% incremental margin drop-through on new revenue, pretty consistent with what we’ve done in the past. The second component is deploying capital towards our top growth initiatives. First, we plan to invest approximately $20 million in 2022 to expand our many sales forces as well as extend our international footprint in Central Europe. More significantly, as Andy discussed in his remarks, we plan to invest in content, technology and marketing to support our residential expansion strategy. Operating costs and investments for residential, which totaled approximately $100 million in 2021, are expected to increase by around $200 million to $220 million to a range of $300 million to $320 million in 2022. A little over half of that increased investment is focused on proprietary content research with the remaining amount earmarked for marketing and software design and development. So when we combine the cash generation of $170 million with the total investment range of $220 million to $240 million, the result is adjusted EBITDA outlook for the year in the range of $565 million to $605 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 20% – 27% at the midpoint of that range. First quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million, indicating a margin of 31% at the midpoint. As we move through 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 20% range during the second and third quarters of 2022 during the peak marketing and research season. Fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve to around 30%. I’ll wrap up today with a summary of our new long-range targets that I mentioned earlier. These new targets incorporate the significant growth opportunity as well as the required investments for our success in residential market strategy. Our new long-range target is to achieve a $5 billion in revenue and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the year 2027. Implicit in this target is an overall 17% compounded annual revenue growth rate. Our goal is to generate revenue from residential products in the range of $700 million to $1 billion in 2027, which would replicate, if not improve upon the success we’ve demonstrated with our Apartments.com investments. We believe the market size and opportunity in residential is significantly larger than in Multifamily, and we would anticipate investment levels in residential during the early years to increase before becoming profit accretive in a few years. Fortunately, we have a very large and profitable commercial product portfolio that we expect will generate over $800 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and will soon grow to over $1 billion per year. By the end of our long-term target horizon, I would expect adjusted EBITDA margins from the commercial real estate focused product areas of our business to approach 50%. With that, I’d like to add thanks to all of our amazing and hard-working CoStar colleagues for a fantastic 2021. And I certainly look forward to 2022 and what we can accomplish together in those years ahead. So I’ll now turn the call back over to Bill and our operator as they’re going to lead us in a rousing rendition of stump the chops. Bill, back to you.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Scott. Blue, would you please assemble the queue for Q&A? [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Go ahead, Blue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Your line is now open.
Sterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I was just curious, in terms of the investment in residential, help us understand in 2022, how much of that’s going to go into sales and marketing? How much is going to go into R&D? And how that mix will morph as you move towards that 2027 goal? Thank you.
Andy Florance: So the majority of that investment in 2022 is content. So it’s in our wheelhouse. It’s one of our core strengths. It’s collecting content for residential real estate to create a favorable environment for SEO and scaling our traffic to our site. A smaller part of that investment later in the year is towards marketing for the launch of the new site. There’s also a significant component for software development and R&D. Do you want to add anything to that?
Scott Wheeler: Sure. Yes. So Sterling, the content portion is over half of the incremental investment, which is I gave a range of $200 million to $220 million. And then the other portion, which is a little less than half, is probably 60% marketing, but as Andy said, it’s more later part of the year as we get ready for broader product rollout. And then the rest is the technology development and software component, which may seem a little low, but as you know, we have a number of software teams in-house now that shift over and help us develop these new products as will happen with our research teams as well. So we'll expect these things to switch places as we go into 2023. As we'll have most of the content development piece behind us, then we'll shift more into marketing and product launch I would expect in the next year or two.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a quick question around the Multifamily. Again, pretty strong bookings there. Discussion around mid-single-digit growth in the first half and double digit in the back half. I was just wondering how much visibility do you have regarding the acceleration in growth in the back half? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Thanks for the question. We definitely were encouraged when we saw it in the fourth quarter that things came off of the – what we call the bottom in the third quarter, which – as you know, when we run the subscription model out, that low third quarter will affect us in the first and second quarters of 2022. So just by the fact that you get past that and we move into the first half of 2022 into the stronger rental season, I think those natural growth numbers will advance in the second half. Now right now, the success of the team in putting in our new list prices and executing on price increases is pretty much driving all the growth we saw in the fourth quarter. And so we're starting to see signs of increased upgrades and volume coming in to this next year. And assuming that continues, and we'll see those growth rates lift in the second half. So it's still a ways away. We like to keep things a little bit close and cautious as we go into New Year's and let those first couple of quarters play out. Then we'll have a much better site for in the second half.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks good afternoon. The $300 million to $320 million in investment spend in residential is a significant step-up. And you mentioned the majority is going into content. Can you elaborate on what kinds of content you're investing in that you currently don't already have in residential that warrants this level of step-up?
Andy Florance: Sure. So it's $200 million incremental investment beyond the baseline of operating Homesnap at Homes that's currently in place. So that content – the area where we're adding a lot of content, if you think about the home shopping experience, there are a number of things that are not about the specific home but are about the place, or in the case of a condominium building, about the community, not about the specific unit. Those are very cost-efficient places to collect valuable content, so neighborhoods, parks, schools, condos. And it creates good SEO drivers, and it creates a good shopper experience that we have tested with the markets and gotten very solid feedback on. One of the things we like about that investment is that while it's a lot of hard work and is aggressive, clearly, it's in our wheelhouse. We have visited millions and millions of buildings across many countries and been able to do that effectively and efficiently. The other thing that's good about that investment is it doesn't just benefit Homes. It benefits Apartments. It benefits LoopNet. It's a pretty broad initiative, strengthening our content across the platform. So we think in comparison to the scope of the TAM and the opportunity and the competitive advantage we perceive we can achieve, we feel it's a very reasonable investment. And was there a second part of that question?
Scott Wheeler: I don't think so, but I'll add a second part of an answer. How is that?
Andy Florance: Let's do that, Scott. Stump the chops.
Scott Wheeler: The content creation that we talked about in the early years, a number of that is onetime gathering of data and media that you've seen us do successfully across many different commercial platforms and markets. And so you would expect that level of investment to drop back in the next year as you then focus more to the marketing and the sales generation on the platforms. So again, considering the size of the market that we're talking about with residential, that's sort of an upfront investment is pretty small compared to the opportunity we see ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. Your line is now open.
Pete Christiansen: Good evening guys. Thanks for the question. Andy, there's some helpful comments on M&A during the pandemic, and it sounds like CoStar is now geared more organically going forward from here. But as you think of the potential landscape for M&A going forward, particularly in residential, are there opportunities out there do you believe that could accelerate your scaling up on the resi side here? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yes. Definitely. We do have irons in the fire. We are looking at things. And there are opportunities to scale and accelerate that. So obviously, as usual, we can't talk about anything until they're real. But there's some pretty significant – there are some significant things out there that we're really focusing as much as anything on strategic, things that we feel will give us valuable content that will help us build the most heavily traffic site over time. And we're not looking to buy revenue per se.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey guys, pardon me. Thanks for taking the question. Andy, for those of us, at least for me, speaking for myself, it might be a little bit answered – slower on the uptake. I think one of the things I'd love to hear you articulate-in as concisely as you can, especially in the context of this big stepped up resi investment. What exactly is this – what is the strategy, right? I mean I just want to understand who you're going, again I realize it's a big TAM, right? We all get that. Who are you going up against? How do you plan to monetize? How do you plan to displace competitors, which I assume are companies like Zillow and Redfin and Zumper[ph]? I mean I think just really concisely, I think investors want to know why you're spending all this money on and not what you're spending and what the return can be and how you get from point A to point B?
Andy Florance: Yes. So in terms of what you're investing in, we have been – at the core, we have gotten clear market research that says there's demand for collaboration. It's really simple. Today, agents and buyers really exist in two disconnected ecosystems, though they have to collaborate in the overwhelming majority of deals. So we're building platforms where they can share content back and forth. When a buyer favorites a property, their agent can see it. When an agent must recommend a property, goes into the favorite list of the client, pretty straightforward. We've tested that with consumers all over the country and agents all over the country, gotten very positive feedback, along with a number of other software components and features. So that's one of – that's a big theme. So working with the industry rather than working to just intermediate the industry. And that's something that worked well for us in the apartment industry. It's worked well for us in the in the LoopNet side of the business, CoStar, Lands of America. So it's a proven model, and it's unique in the residential space. We're the only ones doing it where you work with the industry rather than more towards a disintermediation. In terms of SEO and content, we asked consumers what's really important to them, what they care about in the site, what they're looking for when they select a new home. You wouldn't be surprised to find out that for couples from the age of 25 to 40, schools are important. And in a focused group, they all lean forward when you show them pictures of the neighborhood school. And leaning forward to a focused group is good. That's something we like to get people to do. So we have tested and tested and tested, and we found content that people care about and like that isn't currently offered. So if you look at the current portals, they're all about taking content that other people have produced and repackaging it. And there's not a lot of original content being produced on those portals. There's opportunity to cost effectively produce content that we believe appeals to consumers. So in this case, I'm using something super simple like a picture of the local school or information about neighborhoods, something that we've done before and done quite successfully. So the neighborhood information in – the neighbor information apartments helped us grow from being number seven in SEO to being number one in SEO. So that kind of stuff we've done strategically. And if you look back to when we launched Apartments.com, we did exactly this. We put a lot of people on producing content that gave us SEO advantage, and it worked. And – so it's tested. I don't want to write out a road map in plain English for everyone to hear, but I'm trying to give you some balance between them. And it's not rocket science. It might be science, but it's not rocket science. And it's fairly straightforward. And if you look at what CoStar is good at, we're good at SEO. We're good at content development. We're good at taking pictures of – millions and millions and millions of pictures. And we are good at collaborating with the industry and building successful models in collaboration. And so that's – we're going to our strength.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of...
Andy Florance: I'm sorry. I'll just add one more thing. How you monetize it? Pretty straightforward. And it should mystify people. You monetize it just the way we monetize Apartments.com or LoopNet or Lands of America. People will pay for enhanced exposure to generate more leads or more activity on properties they're selling. That's the single biggest revenue opportunity in real estate. The second way to monetize it is by letting people market their agency services in a way that is not repugnant to the industry, in a way that is supportive of the industry instead of repugnant to the industry. So that's pretty straightforward. And the question of how we compete against other people, CoStar Group has a track record of competing against other people effectively, and I think we'll rest on our record.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon from Needham. Your line is now open.
Kyle Peterson: Hey, good afternoon. This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank. Thanks for taking the quesiton. Just wanted to see if there was any notable seasonality that we should keep in mind for particularly the residential bucket given that there's some runoff from Homes.com, but then also little bit of seasonality in the resi real estate industry and also some pretty strong organic growth in a lot of the core underlying businesses that you guys highlighted.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Sure. We do see seasonality not too much different than what we saw when we first jumped into the apartment space where you have apartments as a rental season in the spring and the summer months that would then cool off after kids went back to school. In the residential side, you see a similar pattern where things will start off, I'll say, at a moderate level in – to start the year. And then it picks up in the spring and the summer months, and then by the time we get to the end of the year, the fourth quarter is going to be the weakest as far as new engagement and involvement in the industry. So we think second and third quarter is the biggest. Fourth quarter is the lightest, and first quarter falls somewhere in between. We also expect that's where our investment focus will also follow that pattern when you talk about marketing and being able to collect valuable content during nicer months of the year than versus snowy cold wintery months of the year.
Andy Florance: You could actually look storage on our servers, and you can tell the weather by how many terabits we're putting into the system. So you can actually see the weather in our storage.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tomasello from KBW. Your line is now open.
Ryan Tomasello: Good evening, thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping you can put a finer point on some of the drivers the guidance for Multifamily growth this year, specifically what you're contemplating for the mix of pricing increases versus new community count growth as well as any potential color around the revenue mix among the different segments of the market, 100-plus unit mid-market and the landlord – independent landlord long tail. I know in the past, you provided growth rates around those different buckets. So it'd be helpful to understand how all of that is layering up into your outlook for this year. Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: Sure. So in the early part of the year, we expect the revenue growth really from the list price and the pricing initiatives that we've implemented. The sales force is doing a great job of getting around to the customers. And as we mentioned in the comments, we are not seeing people drop off the platform. We certainly see some of the fuller buildings in the market, like we commented, I think, last quarter, that might rotate off while other buildings rotate on within a customer's portfolio. So you see a few less properties in total, but you definitely see people staying on the platform. And the pricing initiatives have been very successful. So I expect all the growth in the first half of the year is pretty much from pricing. And then as you get more volumes into the spring and summer season, those volumes will carry over, and you'll start to see, I think, more upgrades, fewer downgrades and a little more volume in the second half to get us back to that double-digit growth.
Andy Florance: And we're still focused on – we're still definitely focused on increasing penetration to new roofs in institutional and the multifamily, the mid-market and the independent owners. There is still significant penetration opportunity there. We plan to continue to grow the sales force to be able to basically touch more of those prospects, and we believe we can do that well. The pandemic was a slow time for being able to grow. And more importantly, train sales forces is getting a lot easier. And we just finished up our first in-person sales conference in two years down in Miami, Florida. And as the guy who spends the first four hours up on stage talking to the sales force, I will tell you without a question, we have a much bigger sales force today than we did two years ago. It is getting quite large. And I'd say that group is very motivated and very positive right now and is producing at some of the highest levels they produced at to – with the record quarter. And so adding into that group, we think, is going to be possible to be able to go for more penetration. But Scott is really forecasting more off of pricing. And one thing about the pricing, we are providing more and more value to our customers. As our traffic success grows, our leads grow. And as our leads grow, our price per lead naturally goes down when we're pricing at the community level. So there's lots of room to get recognition from our customers for the additional value we're providing them, an increased lead flow. In essence, they're getting better and better values on lead flow. Their pricing per community might be going up. So a share shift to us from – possibly from other marketing vehicles.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Your line is now open.
Stephen Sheldon: Hey, thanks. So I guess on the sales force side, it seems like some of the sales force build-out have been a little slower than expected and are weighing on growth, especially looking at LoopNet. So I guess at a high level, is there anything you need to do better to hire and retain sales resources across the company as you think about 2022 in the next few years?
Andy Florance: Yes. I think we are having – I think we need to – like the most important part of the equation is it's great to have geese that lay golden eggs. What's even better is to have geese that lay golden eggs. So those are recruiters. And one of the things we're doing is we're looking within our own sales force for people that want to evolve their careers or – into moving in the recruiting space. And I think our training programs are pretty darn good at this point. And our onboarding is getting – our success rate as people come on board is getting better. But our sales force is getting pretty large. Again, as you sit there and look at 1,000 people at our sales conference, it is growing. With LoopNet in particular, that is something – just like Apartments.com is following that same trajectory where initially, Apartments.com was sold by the CoStar Group. And eventually, we built our stand-alone sales force to sell Apartments. LoopNet is in that same phase, and we're having some success. As I look at the individual metrics of people going into LoopNet, the salespeople going into that group, stand-alone sales force, they're producing at much better numbers that we saw during the pandemic as we tried to onboard people. And in fact, there's some real success stories in that group. So there's – I think our number 2 producer – number 1 producer, I believe, started with us like just – like two years ago. So – and then we have David Malley, [ph] who just joined us from Homes.com who's an experienced operations executive, now running the LoopNet Group, which is good leadership. And Mark Mathis, who actually started with CoStar many years ago, was a senior player at Realtor, running their sales org, has been with Homes, who's now running the LoopNet team. So we're beginning to bolt the group up, and it's a process. It will be another two or three years before we have a robust several hundred person large LoopNet sales team, but we will get there just like we did with Apartments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Campbell from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
John Campbell: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one here. I mean I think on the sizable residential reinvestment cycle, I mean, I think that was a pretty common fear factor shared across the investor base. The push and pull around that is, I think, partly behind – the stock is on a 52-week low here. But your core business, it seems to be in a great spot. You've got this big bet on resi, kind of being more of an offensive move by you guys. You guys do sound pretty convicted you've got framework around eventually driving up those returns. So I mean, obviously, with things progressing as you guys expected, you've got kind of stock that's kind of dislocated here. I'm sure you guys are eventually waiting for this question, but you've got nearly $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It sounds like M&A is maybe a little bit less of a focus in favor of the core. But just give us your latest views on the buyback and how that might change if there's any further dislocation in the stock. Thanks.
Andy Florance: I think that's a great question, and I will turn that over to Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, Andy. We certainly saw a period here in the last – well, it's really only been a year. We just raised a bunch of that capital in mid-2020. So we're really only 1.5 years since money came on board. And certainly a period of high multiples and valuations have weighed a little bit on the pace of our acquisitions. I wouldn't go so far to say that we're not focused on acquisitions anymore. So we definitely are still very seriously focused on acquisitions. And our initial thesis when we brought in the capital is it's going to take probably about five years for us to burn through that as we do deals across the platform. So I think we're still committed to that strategy right now. Obviously, if this continues up for another year, year or two pace, we might have a different conversation. But for now, that's still our direction, and we're focused on putting that money to work first in acquisitions. And then to the extent we need it on organic, we'd do that as well. But like you said, our organic commercial business is producing pretty significant cash flow now. And that's very helpful when you look at our ability to invest in residential and still return – we're still going to do almost $600 million of EBITDA next year even with, as you put it, a big offensive investment. So we're pretty comfortable with the math and the balance of where we are.
Andy Florance: Yes. And when you look at our past track record, we are an acquisitive company. And we've acquired Homesnap, Homes, STR recently. There are things out there, but we are value-sensitive. And I would imagine that over the course of the next three years, four years, we would probably use a lot of that capital and acquisitions.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Mueler from Baird. Your line is now open.
Jeff Mueler: Yes, thanks for putting me in. So I appreciate the confidence in the strategy working out over the next several years. But just help investors understand like what are the KPIs as you think about keeping incremental spend through the three stages of your strategy. And then on, I guess, monetization lagging, I understand the new product phase of it spooling up as products launch starting in early 2023. But on the existing resi revenue, I think you said $70 million in 2022, and you had over like $20 million or around there of Homesnap revenue in Q4, so you're already run rating above that. If you could just help us understand why there's not better monetization on – or a better ramp on that existing monetization.
Andy Florance: Yes. So we're really going for the billions, not the hundreds of millions is what it is. And so the most important role Homesnap plays to the company is growing the participating agent user base and getting deeper engagement with those users. So we – you see us up in the 770,000 agents registered. You see us growing the number of folks paying for the premium version. We have multiple products we can sell over at Homesnap. We can sell sort of retargeting and Facebook ads and Instagram and Waze and all kinds of stuff. Those are the higher dollar value things, but they're less strategic. Like getting an agent to buy the $30, $40, $50 a month premium version of Homesnap is much more valuable to us and that they use and engage in the product more. The agents are the key to the supply side of the real estate industry, and we want to be the first place they go when they have a new listing or when they approach the market or when they want to distribute content to their customers. So on the – so that – we're – we are going for the big win not the second or third quarter. And in terms of KPIs, if you go back to that three-step process of grow, monetize and scale. Grow is where we are, and grow is where we will be into 2023. And that is growing content, growing users, growing unique visitors, growing engagement and relevancy. So we do not believe that we should pull the monetizing lever when you haven't scaled traffic. So you are – if you try to pull the monetizing lever before you scale traffic, you're going to be setting price points well below what you could set a year or two out. So we want to build engagement, grow that engagement, grow the unique visits. And for KPI, I would recommend that as we launch the new product, you look at our site traffic, our engagement. In the shorter term, you can look at the volume of content coming out of the site. And in a little basis, you can see that right now. Homes.com unique visitors doubled year-over-year, keep doubling. After a while, it gets larger. And so then the next thing you're going to be looking for in 2023 – we'll continue to grow and monetize Homesnap. It's a great product that people like, and it's getting better. And as you go into 2023, you'll be looking for new high margin products that will be available on Homes.com, whether it's marking agency in a responsible way or in an industry aligned way, or if it's marketing actual – helping people market their actual properties. And the first revenue you see coming in may be measured in tens of millions of dollars, but you can then understand – you now understand the price points and you can understand the penetration opportunity you could begin to paint out a 10-year picture. The scale is – the scaling, more meaningful levels, is probably 2024. And that's when we're beginning to challenge some of our other product areas and move towards that $1 billion revenue goal. So we'll talk about the KPIs in each one of those 3 phases. And I think we are – it's obviously a huge industry. There are some solid competitors out there. So it is not a get rich quick scheme. It's a work hard, build a plan and have a multiyear vision of where you're going. But we'll be able to talk about the KPIs at each of those three phases.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Andy Florance, Founder and CEO.
Andy Florance: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us for the – for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. We're excited about the initiatives we've got going on here. We're very excited about the residential initiative. Our core business is obviously showing great momentum. We're very proud of what we've accomplished. And I want to congratulate our sales leaders, Marc Swartz, Paige Forrest, Brandon Lu, Tim Condon, David Gibson, Joe Valero, and others and their teams who just turned in our best bookings quarter ever with our best – with November, December and January being three of our four strongest sales months ever. Look forward to them continuing to turn in a great result throughout 2022. We believe that the market conditions in residential sector, combined with our strength in our core business, makes this the right time to accelerate our investment in residential and lay the foundation for growth that will enable us to reach our new five-year financial goals. So with our expansion into the residential properties sector, I believe that our investments will yield $5 billion in revenue for CoStar Group in 2027. I'm confident in our ability to scale our information and marketplace business to deliver attractive returns with adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 40% when we achieve that $5 billion in revenue. We look forward to meeting with you again in our first quarter call on April 26 at the same time, on the same channel. Until then, stay safe, and thank you very much for participating. Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Scott. Enjoy doing this earnings call with you.
Bill Warmington: Yes. Thank you. Great.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you. Good night, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q3 2021 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Bill. You did an excellent job. Good evening, everybody. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2021 grew by 17% year-over-year to $499 million. That’s at the upper end of our guidance range at almost $0.5 billion in revenue for the quarter. Most encouraging, year-over-year revenue growth for CoStar reached double digits this quarter for the first time since before the pandemic. And that’s with a 10% revenue growth in the third quarter and 12% of revenue growth in September. Net bookings of $47 million for the third quarter include the strongest sales quarter in the history of CoStar, which are only dampened by a soft sales quarter for Apartments.com. Adjusted EBITDA of $144 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range, coming in $10 million ahead of the third quarter consensus estimates. Our marketplaces contained to deliver exceptional value to our customers as traffic to our sites increased 25% year-over-year. Our marketing campaigns generated over 4.6 billion impressions in the third quarter across Apartments.com, LoopNet and Ten-X. We are welcoming our newest marketplace, BureauxLocaux, the French commercial marketplace we acquired on October 1st, to our fast growing network of property marketplaces. U.S. apartment market is experiencing the highest unit absorption rate in decades, causing the lowest vacancy rates in decades and the highest rent growth in decades. The absorption rate, vacancy rate and the rental growth are well outside 1 to 2 standard deviations to normal ranges in the past 20 years. The rate of change is stunning and the market stats are best described as whipsawing or extremely volatile. The pandemic initially caused a sharp drop in occupancy high move volumes and slight rent declines. With the availability of vaccine, absorption shot through the roof and occupancy levels and rent growth soared. When you see it on a chart, the slope of the curve is unprecedented. For investment grade rate properties 50 units or more in the United States, the average occupancy range over last 20 years has been -- average occupancy rate has been 93%, 1 standard deviation to low side is 92.3% and 1 standard deviation to high is 93.7%. That’s a very tight range. Owners manage the range tightly to optimize for total revenue by moving unit rents using automated yield management systems. Last year occupancy rates, occupancy fell below the 20-year standard deviation low to 92%. Currently at 95%, the vacancy rate -- the occupancy rate is way above the top end of the standard deviation high of the past 20 years. 95% overall is a very high number. The 20-year average annual net absorption of apartment units is 218,000. This year, the annual absorption rate tripled that average with 658,000 units absorbed. Annual apartment rent growth was 12.4% which is the highest it’s been at any point in the past 20 years. The 20-year average is one sixth that number, at only 2%. The 20-year average rent for an apartment has been $1,250 per month, but today that number has climbed to $1,676 per month. The sky high rents are good for owners, but make for major housing crisis. Investors in apartments are being richly rewarded with the average sales price of an apartment unit at $248,000 a door, which is 82% above the 20-year average. What does this all mean for Apartments.com? Well, our clients are doing very well, very, very well. But it also means that tens of thousands of large investment grade apartment buildings in the United States are now basically fully leased. 12.5% of the U.S. investment grade apartment communities are now 99% leased or more. This is unprecedented. You’ve likely heard anecdotal stories of every major apartment building in some neighborhood having long waiting lists. When a community becomes 99% leased, they may love Apartments.com, but they can lower their advertising level to us. They want to continued presence on our marketplace, but they do not need hundreds of leads a month with zero or one apartment available. Our renewal rates have remained high during this period but thousands of communities that are essentially full have reduced their spend with Apartments. During this high occupancy marketing condition, some may have reduced their spend by 50% or more, though that’s a typical. I believe this is a market anomaly that will resolve back to normal occupancy ranges within a few quarters. From Economics 101, when apartment community is fully leased, it has underpriced its apartments. An optimally full apartment community is about 93% leased. Over time, the automated yield management systems will keep pushing rents until occupancy falls back to 93%, as well as the current levels will draw additional supply, which we’re already seeing high levels of supply -- new supply. I believe the yield management systems were either maxed out by the implied rate of increase necessary to optimize occupancy, or the property managers took the systems offline because they felt the potential rate of rent increase is necessary to maintain optimal occupancy were outside of acceptable social norms for rent increases. One of the primary independent variables in the yield management systems is the number of leads coming into leasing office. More leads means more competition for available units, more competition means the owner can raise rents. We believe that Apartments.com is the primary source of these high value leads that are driving higher rents for the owners. More leads to a point are good. So, despite these wild unprecedented gyrations in the market, we believe that the demand for Apartments.com is stronger than ever. In the year to come, we believe there’ll be unusually high unit turnover and clients will want a steady lead flow during this great migration. In August, we surveyed more than 20,000 renters about their moving intentions. As a result of that survey, we expect apartment market will experience increased turnover, more out of market moves and lower renewals as we head into 2021 -- 2022. When asked, when do you think you will next move into a new residence, 53% of survey respondents said they will move by winter. When asked, what do you plan to do when your current lease expires, only 24% of renters expect to renew within the same community, down from 47% pre-COVID. This all makes sense given the huge affordability changes and changing work-from-home policies. Last month, the National Apartment Association held its first in-person meeting post-pandemic, and I was able to meet with a number of clients. One conversation stands out to me. As we conclude a meeting with our largest client, the senior member of that team said that he wanted to make an important statement. He thanked us profusely for being the single most important partner to his firm. According to him, we were the single greatest source of leads for his communities and helped them have an amazingly successful year. He stressed how much he valued our relationship and how much he appreciates the great work we’re doing for them. I’ve had thousands of client meetings over the last 35 years. His comments were unprecedented in their positivity. Over the past five years, this client has tripled their annual investment with us and become well more than twice the size of our largest CoStar client. Yet while he’s thanking us profusely, his firm is reducing their spending level with us over the past few months by about 5% because of many of its communities were so full.  Despite these market gyrations, I believe we have a fantastic relationship with this client and our relationship with them over the intermediate long term will grow and flourish. I believe they will continue to grow their investment in Apartments.com in the years to come, long past this current market condition. While Apartments.com sales were soft this quarter during this unprecedented high-leasing environment, or highly-leased environment, the strength of our platform remains incredibly strong. Lease were up 39% year-over-year in the third quarter and visits were up 17%. This was partially driven by our biggest marketing quarter of the year, where we developed -- where we delivered 3.5 billion media impressions in the quarter. As we’ve discussed here and on our second quarter call in July, the increase in our site traffic, combined with a largely flat pricing, has meant a windfall value to our clients in terms of effective cost per lead. The average cost per lead has decreased about 35% in two years from $9.55 in 2019 to $6.24 in 2021. To address this imbalance, we began rolling out a new rate card for apartments in September. The rate card further segments our prices with larger communities who are receiving more value, commensurately paying higher rates. In September, we began testing the new pricing with 150 clients, representing about 700 properties. The average initial price increases were 7% and went smoothly. I informally pulled the apartment sales leadership team, and they were not aware of any related cancels. Some of discount eliminations are resulting in more significant revenue growth, though, and we’d expect to see more of that going forward. For example, in September, a Florida client with a 380-unit property with a Gold ad was spending $759, and they renewed and they’re now paying $1,399 for an increase of 84%. A Texas client with a 424-unit property with a Platinum ad was paying $1,349, and they renewed and are now paying $1,799 for an increase of 33%. We will continue to scale our right pricing campaign. And though it has not had an impact on this quarter, we believe that it will have impact in out quarters. Given the value of our client relationships and extreme volatility of the current multifamily markets, we’re moving cautiously to protect the long-term value of our franchise. Despite all the sales successes we’ve had over the last five years, there are many more prospects out there today than we have clients so far. Our estimated penetration of 5 to 100-unit buildings is less than 4% and in the 100-plus-unit buildings, our penetration rate is only about 50%. We believe that we have many, many years of growth ahead for Apartments.com just through new client acquisition. Overall, we continue to believe the U.S. apartment market is a $6 billion to $8 billion revenue opportunity for Apartments.com. CoStar had its strongest new bookings quarter of all time in the third quarter with net bookings up 57% sequentially and up over 500% year-over-year. The record performance was driven by multiple factors, including the growing success of our upsell program, high renewal rates, new product and information capabilities, the return of annual price increase for renewals and continued economic recovery. Based on our sales success in the third quarter, we now expect revenue growth for CoStar of 13% in the third quarter, returning to our long-term historical revenue growth rate. Historically, we sold multiple versions of the CoStar product across two dimensions: separate functionality modules for basic property information, comparable sales data and tenant information; and separate geographic coverage for local, regional, state, national and global. 18,000 of our 30,000 CoStar clients had a version that was less than the full CoStar offering, so they were able to take -- they were not able to take full advantage of the CoStar product capability. On July 1st, we started selling only the single comprehensive global integrated CoStar platform and began a 12 to 18-month process of upgrading those 18,000 accounts. This is a win-win in which clients get access to CoStar’s unmatched breadth and depth of information and analytics on commercial estate globally, while we streamline product development, marketing and support. Since the start of the program in July 1st, we have upgraded about 3,000 or 18% of those 18,000 eligible accounts, generating $7 million in annual sales. With a strong starting point, we remain confident the upsell process will generate $30 million to $40 million in incremental annual revenue. Of the almost 1,300 clients we surveyed in the third quarter who upgraded or had a conversation of upgrading, about two-thirds gave us a Net Promoter Score of 9 or 10. We think the favorable reactions from clients reflect the higher value they’re receiving from the incremental capabilities of CoStar’s single integrated platform. Again, the CoStar sales team delivered their best quarter of net new business generation ever, 8% higher than the extraordinary fourth quarter of 2017, back when Xceligent filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and 27% higher than the first quarter of 2018 when we sunsetted LoopNet Premium Searcher. On a per rep net sales level, the team is 1.5 times more productive than pre-pandemic. And these performance results are not just tied to our initiative and pricing actions, we signed up nearly 20% more new customer agreements in Q3 2021 versus the quarterly pre-pandemic average in 2019. In the first quarter of 2021, we integrated commercial mortgage-backed security loan information to CoStar, CMBS data, providing our customers valuable insights into more than $1 trillion of outstanding commercial loans made to over 100,000 commercial properties. Our clients have taken advantage of that highly detailed loan financial data with approximately 60,000 unique users collectively accessing that data over 800,000 times year-to-date. Next month, we plan to launch CMBS Analytics, which aggregates CMBS loan and property data across over 1,000 markets by property type, representing over 3 million CoStar properties. In addition to analytics, we’ll also release prepayment information, historical loan commentary and status and information on 150,000 disposed loans. We estimate the CMBS data generated over $3 million of net new annualized revenue in the third quarter. CoStar Lender, a new analytic tool that helps lenders with the underwriting, monitoring and regulatory reporting of commercial real estate loans, is progressing on plan. We are walking clients through the system and their feedback has been very positive. We’re on schedule for release in the first quarter of 2022. The first Lender release will focus on portfolio risk analytics and surveillance to help lenders meet regulatory and accounting requirements along with a loan screening tool for originators and underwriters. Subsequent releases will focus more on loan origination and underwriting as we broaden the solution to cover the entire lending cycle. These lender tools are specialized high-value applications and so will be priced at a premium to our standard CoStar offering. As such, we estimate they represent a potential incremental annual revenue opportunity of over $300 million. In mid-October, CoStar further broadened its international coverage with the launch of the Montreal market, the 18th largest city in North America by population. Montreal is the sixth market for CoStar and Canada since the launch of Toronto in 2014. CoStar currently tracks about 33,000 properties in Montreal with about 238,000 properties in Canada overall. Last Friday, marked the two-year anniversary of the great acquisition of STR. The uneven recovery of the hospitality industry continued in the third quarter, but STR’s revenue continued to grow at an impressive 13% year-over-year. Their quarterly renewal rate on our business remains strong at 94%. An encouraging sign of the recovery of the health of the industry, STR continues to add to the number of hotels that provide data to us. In August, this number reached 70,000 hotels, which is an all-time high. Separately, we’re seeing good progress in P&L -- new contributors to P&L and forecast is quite impressive. Back on April 1st, CoStar Suite subscribers received access to highly-detailed data on 90,000 new and enhanced hotel properties. In mid-September, we reached another milestone with a cumulative 1 million property views of that data by CoStar subscribers. While still early, the CoStar sales force campaigns targeting high-quality hospitality leads have generated over $2 million in new annualized revenue. Our LoopNet marketplaces delivered another strong performance in the third quarter with revenue growth of 17%. Growth in revenue from our Premium Diamond, Platinum and Gold signature ads was 52% -- was up 52% in the third quarter with a number of ads as well as the average price per ad, both growing by strong double-digit amounts. Renewal rates remain very strong, reaching an all-time high on a rolling 12-month basis in the third quarter, which demonstrates the recognition by our customers the value and effectiveness of LoopNet advertising. Our LoopNet marketing campaign was in full swing in the third quarter and is expected to deliver 2.2 billion media impressions in 2021 across TV, streaming and social channels. Our inaugural campaign titled Space for Dreams featured prominently on major sports events, primetime TV, streaming services and a wide variety of digital channels. The campaign is targeting tenants who can search and find great spaces on LoopNet. In the third quarter, LoopNet marketplaces grew traffic almost 20% year-over-year and delivered a new quarterly high of almost 11 million unique visitors on an average monthly basis. In fact, our site traffic is now more than 40% above the pre-pandemic levels. Office vacancy remains very elevated by historic standards. We believe that LoopNet is uniquely positioned as the ideal marketplace for brokers and owners to market, to help fill those painful current and potential vacancies. We continue to make progress expanding our direct sales channel for LoopNet. New hires and training were launched in the third quarter, and we currently have 32 salespeople dedicated to selling only LoopNet. Our goal is to have 50 dedicated LoopNet sellers by the end of the year or more, and continue to hire aggressively throughout 2022. Our CoStar Info sales team will continue to sell both CoStar and LoopNet in the foreseeable future. Overall, I’m very happy with the value and the performance of our LoopNet marketplaces and the growth potential before us. Today, our signature ad listings only represent about 7% of the highest-valued properties across the U.S. And so, I believe we are well positioned to continue strong double-digit growth for many years to come. Our residential business delivered strong 3Q results with our Homesnap product revenue growing almost 40% year-over-year and SaaS revenue growing almost 45%. Homesnap Pro registered users grew 15% to 777,000. Total agent subscribers to Homesnap Pro+ grew 53% to over 67,000 at the end of the third quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we repurposed approximately 60 salespeople from Homes.com to Homesnap. Upon completion of their training, the group went into production in mid-July. The results have been outstanding. In their short time selling Homesnap, Homes.com transplants have generated over $5 million in annualized revenue. The average monthly reoccurring revenue generated by these new salespeople at Homesnap is about 70% higher than when they were selling at Homes.com. Throughout 3Q, we eliminated or winding down the vast majority of the products and banner ads sold through the Homes.com website. We refocused the Homes.com team to improve and optimize the Homes.com site and implement a new experience for agents and consumers using the platform. For the first time ever, consumers can come to Homes.com or a major real estate portal, and connect directly to the listing agent, consistent with our Your Listing, Your Lead philosophy. Consumers are no longer served up buyer agents with -- who know nothing about the property or the buyer. And that’s been a major pain point for consumers with other competing residential sites. So, we’re doing something completely different, and hopefully, it will be a much better experience for the agents and the buyers. Now, in addition, we’re increasing the content of Homes.com to give consumers expanded options to find a place to live. Starting in August, Apartments.com listings are now appearing on the Homes.com site, adding over 800,000 apartment availabilities for consumers to choose from. This added content not only improves traffic to Homes.com but is expected to add millions of unique monthly visitors to Apartments.com, benefiting both of these marketplaces. The response to these changes has been very encouraging so far. Proper lease generated and sent directly to listing agent were up over 60% since we acquired Homes.com compared to the same period last year. Two weeks ago, we announced a very important new partnership with the Real Estate Board of New York or REBNY, to create Citysnap, the first-ever consumer-facing search website and mobile app for New York City’s residential listing service or connected to that unique feed of data that the agents maintain. Citysnap will provide complete, accurate and real-time residential listing data to agents, building owners and most importantly, homebuyers and tenants. The new site and app will go live in the middle of 2022. Citysnap will offer consumers and brokers multiple advantages. It will be free to list on Citysnap, so that means we have all of the listings, not just the paid listings. We will connect potential buyers and renters with listing agent consistent with our Your Listing, Your Lead philosophy, and make collaboration possible through access to Homesnap’s suite of tools. The thing that makes Citysnap partnership revolutionary however is promoted listings, where you can find promoted listings on the internet for just about any other product these days, including apartments on Apartments.com and the commercial property of LoopNet, you don’t see that for residential homes in the U.S. until now. As far as our partnership with the Real Estate Board of New York, we will be able to offer promoted listings on Citysnap. So agents and consumers will be able to buy preferred placement and features to increase market exposure. In a few weeks, we’ll be attending the National Association of Realtors Conference. The annual NAR conference is the industry’s largest trade show, drawing thousands of residential property professionals from across the country. As we did with our customers in the apartment industry, we won our presence at this show to be assigned to residential real estate brokers and agents that we intend to partner with them and support them as opposed to trying to disintermediate them. We believe we can build a profitable, successful business without disintermediating our clients. We plan to use our technology and services to help them strengthen their relationships with their clients and sell more properties. Less than 10 years ago, we had literally almost no presence, traffic or revenue in online marketplaces. Since that time, we have grown to be the leader in digital real estate marketplaces with approximately 90 million unique visitors per month, and we’re generating nearly $1 billion in run rate revenue in the third quarter for a 10-year compound annual revenue growth rate of 55%. We have successfully demonstrated our ability to generate leading marketplace positions by curating the best content, offering a great user experience and bringing effective market strategies to bear. Our Belbex business in Spain, which we purchased in 2015, had no marketplace exposure back then and had 1/10 of site traffic of much larger competitors. Within five years, we’ve grown our listing content by 22 times and achieved the top position among dedicated commercial property portals in Spain with about 70% of our traffic coming organically. Realla in the UK has grown listing content 8 times in three years and increased the number of unique visitors to our site by over 4 times. During this time, Realla’s share of commercial property site traffic has increased from 5% to almost 60%. We are excited to continue to expand our international marketplace capabilities with the acquisition of BureauxLocaux, one of the largest specialized property portals for buying and leasing commercial real estate in France. Launched in 2008, BureauxLocaux provides a subscription-based commercial property listing advertising platform, with a client base that includes over 90% of France’s top commercial property agents and brokers. Traffic to the company’s website, BureauxLocaux, has grown by 30% of compound annual base since the beginning of 2018. BureauxLocaux has over 60,000 for sale and lease listings and over 425,000 visits to its website each month. This acquisition is an important one for our international expansion strategy as France has the sixth largest economy in the world and has total real estate valued at an estimated $7 trillion. BureauxLocaux has built a leading commercial property specific platform with national coverage, great brand recognition and an excellent reputation among its clients. Finally, Ten-X revenue grew 20% -- I’m sorry, 27% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2021. We saw a 19% increase in average deal size and a 32% increase in transaction volume. Unique visitors to the Ten-X site grew 230% year-over-year. The average number of bidders per asset in the third quarter was 3.6% versus 2.8% a year ago. The synergistic network effect of improving supply and demand is reflected in Ten-X trade rate, which is the total assets sold as a percentage of the total assets brought to the platform. The third quarter 2021 trade rate remains strong at 71%, which we believe is about twice the average trade rate for offline traditional property sales. On the supply side, the dollar value of assets brought to the Ten-X platform year-to-date grew 37% from $1.7 billion in 2020 to $2.4 billion in 2021. Total gross merchandise value sold in the third quarter increased 92% year-over-year. 83% of the assets by dollar value we closed in the third quarter of 2021 were performing assets, sold by institutional and private client groups. In the third quarter of last year, that figure was only 65%, reflecting the ongoing transformation of Ten-X from a distressed asset platform into a market rate commercial property sales platform. Ten-X is still very capable of selling distress though. And with office vacancy rates at the highest level in decades and only 36% of the leased space occupied, we currently have an absurdly high functional vacancy rate of 70% in the office world. The Castle security access data also shows us that only -- we’re only seeing about a 100 basis-point improvement per month in the percent of swipe cards being used. If this issue results in a significant number of distressed properties coming to market, Ten-X could experience a major windfall selling these distressed properties in the quarters to come or years to come. We believe that these strong performance numbers prove that Ten-X’s value proposition of better speed, certainty exposure, cost and control than using a traditional property sales process increasingly resonate with brokers buying or selling commercial real estate properties. So, at this point, I’m going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler, who is going to share some riveting numbers with you.
Scott Wheeler: I know how much you love the riveting numbers. You’re like when you go to the Charlie Brown Show, you know, it’s the teacher, all you hear is wah, wah, wah, number, number, wah, wah, wah, number, number when you listen to me.
Andy Florance: I hear something.
Scott Wheeler: I can tell. Anyway. Thank you, Andy, for your introduction. Great to have another strong financial quarter in the books, and of course, to see all the increasing number of product, content and marketing investments that, as you can hear from what Andy said, are delivering such great value to all of our clients. So, it is clear that over the past few years, we have established both, CoStar and Multifamily as businesses that are operating within these massive addressable markets and each of them have multibillion-dollar revenue potential. Now similarly, our LoopNet Marketplace and now our residential business also both operate in massive addressable markets and each have multibillion-dollar revenue potential. So, this quarter, we revised how we report our disaggregated revenue to increase the visibility to these $1 billion-plus potential business areas: CoStar, Multifamily, LoopNet and Residential, each of whose revenue will now be reported individually. Each of the sectors include both domestic and international revenue where applicable. So, the revenue sector that was formerly known as Commercial Property and Land has left the CoStar Group and it’s now working full-time from home on a lovely beach somewhere. So, we had to say farewell to Commercial Property and Land and thank them for the sector’s solid five years of performance and exceptional service. So, in its place, we now have a new, and I must say a very creatively titled sector that I personally named, called Other Marketplaces. Now, I didn’t spend a dime of our precious marketing spend to come up with that one, but it does include Ten-X, our Lands and our Businesses for Sale marketplace. So hopefully, I’ll remember to provide the relevant comparisons to all of you this quarter for the old grouping, while we transition to the new revenue sector information, will help everyone come along with the transition. So, I’m sure if I missed something, you’ll probably ask. So, in the third quarter, revenue of $499 million was near the high end of our guidance range. CoStar and residential both outperformed in terms of revenue in the quarter, partially offset by the lower revenue than we expected in Multifamily. Organic revenue growth for the third quarter 2021 was 12%, which is in line with our expectations. CoStar revenue increased 10% year-over-year in the third quarter, ahead of our guidance, marking the highest CoStar growth quarter since before the pandemic. CoStar is definitely on a roll. Renewal rates for CoStar remained their all-time highs and the average revenue size of our contracts has increased over pre-pandemic levels by over 20%. Both are very encouraging signs. The strong sales performance for our CoStar sales force, that Andy mentioned, is expected to accelerate the CoStar revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter to 13%. Now prior to the 2020 downturn, CoStar revenue growth has been between 12% and 14% on both the 10 and a 5-year compounded annual basis. So, we’re now firmly back in our CoStar comfort zone. And we expect to stay there for the foreseeable future. Keep in mind that we only recently initiated renewal pricing increases, which we expect will provide additional tailwinds for CoStar revenue growth throughout next year. Information Services revenue grew 8% in the third quarter of 2021 as our subscription revenue continues to grow in STR and Real Estate Manager. Onetime report purchases and other transaction revenues were slightly behind expectations. We expect lower transaction revenues in the future as we’re now selling CoStar subscriptions to hospitality companies, following the integration of STR hospitality data that we completed earlier this year. So, over time, this is expected to eliminate the need for these customers to purchase onetime report products. This is, of course, part of the subscription model strategy that we employ and that we pursue with all of our acquired businesses. Accordingly, we anticipate Information Services revenue to grow approximately 9% for the full year of 2021. Growth in Multifamily revenue was 10%, slightly below our expectation for the reasons that Andy mentioned. Approximately half of the revenue growth year-over-year in the third quarter is from new properties advertising with us and the other half is from growth in the average rate per property. As we continue to ramp up our new price program in the fourth quarter and beyond, and considering the latest multifamily market trends that Andy discussed, we expect the year-over-year revenue growth rate for Multifamily to be in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now for comparison purpose to our sector guidance at the end of the second quarter, the old Commercial Property and Land Group of Marketplaces delivered 53% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter, with all the businesses in this sector performing at or ahead of our expectations. Our LoopNet Marketplace revenue sector includes the LoopNet Marketplace as well as the international Commercial Property marketplaces. These are Belbex in Spain, Realla in the UK and now BureauxLocaux in France. The addition of BureauxLocaux into our financial results does not have a material impact on the quarter on the LoopNet Marketplace sector. The LoopNet revenue increased 17% in the third quarter, marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Signature ads, which grew 50%-plus year-over-year, are up both in volume by 20% and revenue per property by 30%. Once again, the CoStar LoopNet sales team knocked it out of the park for the quarter. They sold over 90% of their output coming from CoStar and less than 10% went to LoopNet. Now, this is great news overall, of course, and even with this trend heavily weighted to CoStar sales, more so than last quarter. We still expect LoopNet revenue growth of 14% in the fourth quarter and 16% growth for the full year of 2021. Revenue from residential business was $25 million in the third quarter with Homesnap providing the vast majority of the revenue as we wind down the legacy Homes.com products. Homesnap pro forma revenue growth was nearly 40% for the third quarter of 2021. We expect residential revenue of $20 million in the fourth quarter with Homesnap revenue growth exceeding 50%, which is higher than our previous forecast. The new direct sales force in Homesnap is delivering great momentum during what is typically expected to be a slower time of the year. We’re successfully winding down Homes.com legacy revenue ahead of schedule and don’t expect a material contribution from these products in the fourth quarter of this year. Because of this faster elimination of the Homes.com legacy revenue, fourth quarter 2021 revenue for residential in total is slightly lower than what was included in our prior forecast. For the full year 2021, continuing revenue in our residential business is expected to be a little over $60 million, which excludes the discontinued Homes.com revenue. Revenue for Other Marketplaces, our newest member of the revenue reporting family, includes Ten-X along with our lands and businesses for sale marketplaces. Approximately half of the revenue in the second half of 2021 in Other Marketplaces is from Ten-X. Because Ten-X revenue is transactional and recognized when the closings occur for properties that are sold through the platform, the Other Marketplaces revenue doesn’t behave in that same friendly linear fashion as our businesses that are fully subscription-based. In other words, we expect a few more ups and downs between quarters, depending on the property sale timing. Other Marketplaces third quarter 2021 revenue grew 21%, with all businesses delivering double-digit growth. There is uncertainty in the timing of when some assets will close in the fourth quarter for Ten-X, which caused a modest reduction in our fourth quarter revenue outlook. Lands and businesses for sale marketplaces are expected to deliver strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. The total revenue is expected in the $32 million to $33 million range for Other Marketplaces in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our gross margin came in at 81% in the third quarter, consistent with the prior two quarters and the trend we expect to continue through the end of the year. Net income was $64 million in the third quarter of 2021, and our effective tax rate was 23%, which was in line with the expectations we provided in our last call. Adjusted EBITDA was $144 million in the third quarter, up 8% from prior year and $9 million above the high end of our guidance range. The favorability is a combination of slower ramp-ups in hiring and slightly lower marketing costs in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29%, 200 basis points above our third quarter forecast. Cash and investments approximated $3.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $87 million from the end of the second quarter of 2021. Looking at some of our performance metrics, our sales force approximated 850 at the end of the third quarter of 2021, which is a slight increase from the third quarter from the prior year and down around 55 people from the second quarter of 2021. The sequential reduction in sales headcount is primarily the result of the integration of Homes.com and the reduction of the sales force that was not repurposed to sell Homesnap and Multifamily. LoopNet and Ten-X sellers increased while Multifamily sellers decreased modestly during the quarter. Contract renewal rates were 92% for the third quarter, in line with the second quarter and a 300 basis-point increase versus the third quarter last year. Renewal rates for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 97%, consistent with the second quarter of this year and 250 basis points above the third quarter of last year. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounted for 76% of overall revenue, a 1% decrease from the previous quarter because of the Homes.com acquisition. I’ll now talk through our outlook for the full year and fourth quarter of 2021. Full year revenue for the year is now expected in the range of $1.935 billion to $1.940 billion for 2021, which represents a narrowing of our guidance range, along with approximately an $8 million reduction at the midpoint. This reduction reflects the more cautious approach to our forecasting to the Ten-X property sale timing, the net impact of CoStar’s strength against lower Multifamily revenue growth and the accelerated elimination of Homes.com revenue in the fourth quarter. This full-year range implies a fourth quarter revenue range of $498 million to $503 million, representing revenue growth of 13% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. We are increasing our adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year by approximately $8 million at the midpoint of the range. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to range from $615 million to $620 million, which incorporates the outperformance in the third quarter, along with continued cost favorability in the fourth quarter of this year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $161 million to $166 million, for an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 32%. So, that about wraps it up for me today. I will now turn the call back over to Bill and our friendly moderator to open up the line for questions.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Scott. Sadie, would you please give instructions and assemble the roster for the Q&A portion of the call? Analysts, please limit yourselves to one really good question. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we have Pete Christiansen from Citi.
Pete Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the question. And thanks guys for the added transparency disclosures on the revenue side, I really appreciate. I think I have to ask this question. I know we’re in just the end of October here. But Andy, I guess, as you look forward to 2022, just wondering if you had a sense on spending as you think about ramping up the residential effort? Any sense of how that will play in, whether there’s any connection there with some of the revenue weakness that we’re seeing in the apartment side? Do you have the opportunity to pivot more spending dollars from apartments over to residential? Thank you.
Andy Florance: Yes. So, at this point, what we’re focused on with residential is growing our selling operation of Homesnap. So, Homesnap, we’re having great success there, as you can see from these numbers, good, strong SaaS revenue, subscription revenue, the concierge product. We’re accelerating that growth rate dramatically. We believe there is additional room to accelerate that growth rate of Homesnap. So, the Homesnap Pro product doesn’t have a sales force right now. That product reminds me an awful lot of what LoopNet looked like over the last 10 to 15 years when it was being sold at a $50 a month subscription level. And I think it would be healthy for us to be growing the community of residential agents that regularly connect and log into Homesnap and turn to us as an important marketing tool for them and information tool for them. So, that’s our primary focus. And that does not involve large-scale consumer marketing initiatives. That’s really about salespeople and software. And secondarily, what we’re focused on doing is dialing in exactly the right formula for Homes.com and the right relationship between the professional community at Homesnap and the consumer, the buyers who are going to be on Homes.com and making sure that we’re designing the right tools there for them. So, until we have finished that software, finished those designs, fully flushed out where these two products are going, which we’re working very hard on right now, we are -- it’s premature to be looking at dramatic spending initiatives beyond adding salespeople to Homes.com and little bit of software initiatives and the like. So, it’s still open. Now, could we dial back some of the spending on Apartments.com when so many apartment communities are full, probably, and we’ve already had those discussions, not huge, it’s not something that is necessary to free up some initiative over on the residential side, so.
Operator: For our next question, we have Jackson Ader from JP Morgan.
Jackson Ader: I’m on for Sterling Auty tonight. The question really is about timing of two things: expectations on maybe the timing for the Multifamily business to begin to rebound; and then, Andy, when you mentioned the potential windfall for Ten-X, with some of the distressed assets may be coming on to the market, any expectation on when that -- when or if that timing might come to fruition? Thank you.
Andy Florance: Sure. So, there are two primary factors with Apartments.com, I think I’ve mentioned. One is this unusual volatility. The spike in occupancy levels, that’s unprecedented. I am sort of predicting something that hasn’t happened before. I believe it begins to reconcile in the next two quarters. It could be one to four quarters, but I do not believe that sophisticated operators of apartment communities are going to leave their occupancy levels so high and miss an opportunity to churn rents as well as you just naturally are going to have so much musical chairs and churn going on because of these pricing changes and work-from-home changes. So, I think it will break pretty quickly. Second major factor is the fact that we are delivering significantly more economic value to our customers than we’ve ever delivered before. And I believe there is an opportunity to recognize that. We’ve trialed some of that in September, and we’ll continue to ramp that up into the fourth quarter and first quarter and the second quarter. So, I think you’re probably -- you’re not looking for any dramatic changes in the fourth quarter this year, but I think you’ll move into a strong 2022. And again, I want to stress that the product itself is as strong as it’s ever been. And we’ve actually been a part of probably helping the industry to achieve the highest rents they’ve ever achieved. I wish we had options on rental levels, but we don’t. And I guess, the second question was when would we expect to see Ten-X benefit from distressed levels in office, well, it’s not something we can predict the exact data, something like that. It’s just my sense is, as I walk through all these office buildings, and I don’t see a human being, that there’s a potential problem there. And so, at some point, rational CFOs will begin to rightsize some of these properties. I do believe that work-from-home is not an effective long-term solution. So, I think that will mitigate to some degree in the market. I am seeing all kinds of examples of businesses running into trouble because they’re not operating at the same productivity levels from a work-from-home model. But, I think that -- I think it could be a 2022 thing. I can’t believe there won’t be some distress somewhere, especially sort of second-generation office buildings may have a tougher time, but Ten-X is really good at selling, finding the biggest audience possible to find that buyer for some real oddball stuff and some high-quality stuff. So, I would think 2022, but I’d be surprised if there’s not some sort of something coming there. So, these two facts -- this sort of effective 70% vacancy rate is potentially a tailwind behind LoopNet and Ten-X.
Operator: For our next question, we have David Chu from Bank of America.
David Chu: So, should 4Q then be the trough in Multifamily revenue, given that you get some pricing benefits and then occupancy rates can’t really go higher? Does that make sense?
Andy Florance: That likely makes sense. And yes, it’d be really odd if occupancy went -- rates went higher.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, not much room left.
Andy Florance: That would be strike. So, I think that’s a fair assessment.
Operator: For our next question, we have George Tong from Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: So, apartment vacancy rates have reached the lowest level in recent history. And you mentioned that that should normalize in a few quarters as yield management systems push rents up. What’s the likelihood that this could be the new norm over the medium term as the economic recovery continues to take hold? And how receptive have customers been to some of your pricing and lead management initiatives to try to compensate and address the prevailing dynamics?
Andy Florance: So, I think that -- I do not believe it’s the new norm to have 99% leased communities. I do not believe. It’s sort of like unemployment, like if you get to 1% unemployment, you have a very unhealthy economic situation. If you get to less than X number of days of supply of housing, you get to a very -- you get to a frozen market. So, I believe that it remains in owners’ interest to have enough vacancy that they’re sort of testing -- they had churn in there and that they’re testing the upper limits of their pricing. For these folks, with fixed mortgages, moving these rents up is extremely attractive. Their NOI goes up at a much higher rate than their rental rate does. So, you move 10% up on your rental rate, you might be moving up 40% on your NOI and a cap rate of 3.5%. These folks are motivated to push rents. They may push rents and sell the asset, right? But I don’t think it’s a new normal. So, secondarily, the reception we’ve received to the pricing changes has been very positive. Again, I pulled -- met for couple of hours recently with some of the senior sales leadership on the apartment side and asked, had anybody canceled. And an answer I get back without doing a deep dive audit was, no. And that secondarily, overall people were fine with it. Now remember, these people who are pushing these pricing increases too, it’s not that we are increasing their price. We are reducing the rate at which we reduce their cost per lead at a time in which they’re getting tremendous value from these more and more efficient lower cost leads. I think it’s possible that we’re giving some of these communities, leases for as low as $30 a lease, when they have historically paid potentially $300 per lease, $700 per lease. So, I think it’s a fairly straightforward conversation. We’re delivering value. And I think folks want us to continue to delivering that kind of value. So, it’s something people are responding to. Now, I’d be disappointed if some owner -- property managers somewhere didn’t bring out their procurement officer and try to beat us up. So, I expect that to happen, but no cancellation so far is pretty good.
Operator: For our next question, we have Ryan Tomasello from KBW.
Ryan Tomasello: It’s clear that apartments will continue to be a bit of a drag on growth, heading into next year, depending on how these unprecedented occupancy levels of all. But I wanted to give you an opportunity, Andy, to walk through some of the bright spot tailwinds for the business in 2022 and where you think there’s room for growth acceleration.  For example, at LoopNet, where the sales force is ramping, Residential, where you’re making investments and also CoStar Suite with these new product enhancements in the upsell for -- I guess, without tipping your hand on guidance, how are you thinking about the organic growth power for the business progressing through 2022 and even beyond, if you’re willing to get out that crystal ball?
Andy Florance: Sure. So, first of all, bright spots in just the Multifamily and Apartments.com, it’s important to keep looking at those penetration rates overall. So, there’s two factors. What your revenue is per unit with your existing customers and then also your ability to add new customers. So, we still remain at very low penetration rates, we are proving our ability to sell, not only at the 120, 150-unit communities, but we’re proving our ability to sell successfully at the 75-unit community, the 50-unit community, 30-unit community, 10-unit community, 4-unit community. So, it’s all greenfield for Apartments.com. We have -- we can double, triple, quadruple, grow tenfold the number of communities participating with us through time. So, that’s an important growth driver that remains there in 2022 and certainly, we remain very-focused on. And then, the other thing is that these pricing initiatives and rightsizing also I believe could generate -- may well generate some good momentum moving into the middle of 2022 for Apartments.com. LoopNet is, as I said, doing really well, you see in the traffic numbers. I really do believe that digital marketing is the new norm in commercial real estate. And I believe we have an extraordinary opportunity there because of our incredible share of traffic and eyeballs in that industry. I think there are a lot of folks in commercial real estate, who are still operating on 1985 marketing paradigms, largely based on print or digital substance of print. And I think that there’s going to be more and more awareness and awakening there. I am thrilled with what’s happening in Homesnap. Everyone was looking for us to go out and spend $1 trillion on marketing and do sort of exactly what REA Group is doing or what Rightmove is doing. We will develop in pace something like that. But, we have a great product there in Homesnap that residential agents like. And it hasn’t been widely marketed or sold to that community, and we’re pretty good at doing that. So, I think there’s a lot of revenue that can be built there, that’s great revenue because it’s strategic revenue that builds the base platform that’s unique to us to be able to also be a leading player in the consumer marketplaces. CoStar, you heard our discussion of all these new sort of initiatives beyond the upsell process, but just the lender, STR, that sort of progression of new features, it’s going to be -- I am blown away by how well our sales people are doing on that side, just the individual productivity rates I’m seeing are unprecedented. And the whole reason we’re doing this upsell initiative, the whole reason we’ve been launching a successful upsell initiative, is to prep the field for the next revenue growth initiative, which is unlocking the value of cross-border information with our gradual expansion into Europe, continued expansion in Canada and the fact that the vast majority of investing of institutional-grade assets crosses borders. We want to be able to provide solutions there and then actually drive revenue for our shareholders there as well. So, no shortage of stuff going on across all these businesses we’ve got. We are going to get some market anomalies, some odd things happening here and there, a black swan event here or there, but a lot of tailwinds overall. And thank you, Mark Schwartz and Drew Davidson for just killing it and your sales team there in CoStar.
Operator: For our next question, we have John Campbell from Stephens Incorporated.
John Campbell: On the RBNY partnership in Citysnap, I mean, obviously, StreetEasy has kind of dominated that NYC market in recent years. We’ve heard a lot of pushback on the kind of daily listing fees. I think, they started with a freemium model, but the pricing has gone from, I think it was $1.50 to like $6 per day, and that’s happened in a handful of years. But Andy, I think you said this is going to be free to list. So, I’m just curious about Citysnap’s kind of approach to pricing, or are we thinking about this more of like a strategic move for you guys, maybe something you can build off in the future?
Andy Florance: Sure. So, remember, Citysnap is Homesnap. And there are over 1 million agents. And those agents, when they start using Citysnap, when the MLS buys it for them, it might be free, it may not be -- but when they subscribe to the enhanced functionality of the product, they may begin spending $50 a month with us, similar to what we use to get for LoopNet. Then if they start using us for concierge marketing services, they might spend $500 a month with us, $600 a month with us. And when you start thinking about 1 million agents spending $500, $600 a month, then you start to get to an interesting number, right? Because that’s not a year, that’s a month, $500 a month. So, we’re selling a lot of that right now, and that’s going well. So, we don’t really have to do anything like what StreetEasy is doing, which is so unpopular in order to be financially successful. So, yes, I’m aware that like folks are pretty annoyed at StreetEasy and the fact that the prices are going up so rapidly, it’s all pay to list. And some of the functionality where they’re using other people’s listings to try to get brokers fees for agent fees for other people. So, like we have to pay to not have a different agent’s name on your listing is kind of -- blackmail is too strong a word for it, but it’s zillamail or something, I don’t know. It’s a little offensive to the industry, which is why you’re seeing stuff like such an unprecedented thing that’s never happened before. There’s never been an MLS before in New York City. This is the first time the agents have all gotten together and actually created something together. And we’re honored to have the chance to try to serve that. Initially, the fees are on Homesnap Pro+, which is sort of Citysnap Pro+ and the concierge marketing products and then ultimately over time, it will be marketing revenue very similar to what we do with Apartments.com, LoopNet or REA Group. These are marketing solutions that allow almost all the brokers to participate, not just a small selection of them. It’s something we do that allows them to participate in a way in which they feel that we’re their ally, not their disintermediation enemy. So, there’s a whole bunch of ways we can do this. Now, we don’t minimize the challenge of building an audience in it. But, we obviously have experience in building audiences, and we like taking on these challenges. I’m not sure if I answered your question, but that was that.
Scott Wheeler: Sounded good.
Operator: For our next question, we have Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities.
Andrew Jeffrey: Andy, I just want to understand the dynamic in Multifamily pricing. And I appreciate the fact that you’re lowering apartment owners’ and managers’ cost to generate leads, and that’s the key. Can we think about perhaps because of the value proposition, a period at some point in the next 12 or 18 months as vacancies normalize, where we see demand increase on top of the pricing increases you’ve put in place? I mean, I don’t -- in other words, I wouldn’t expect prices to revert, right? And so, you could get some leverage coming out of this, timing uncertain?
Andy Florance: Absolutely. So, the value proposition we’ve delivered is really incredible. So, when we bought Apartments.com, like five, six years ago, they were generating, I believe, sub-20 leads per property per month, maybe 10 to 15. We’re now generating 175 leads per month. The pricing hasn’t moved anything like that. And so, rerationalizing that pricing to effectively slow the rate at which we bring the cost per lead down, is separate from what’s going on in these super high occupancy levels. So, we might see revenue growth associated with more rational pricing of lead delivery, recognizing that some communities pull many more leads, some communities need less. But we may see pricing revenue acceleration from that. And then you may see a return to people needing to move up our tier levels to drive more listings as they see vacancies as people move back and forth and play musical chairs in rentals with all this work-from-home stuff and as well as potential changes in the economy and then also changes then get higher rent growth. So, if these folks pull another -- if our clients pull another 10% rent increase, they may see occupancy levels fall still at high levels, but our leads will become worth 10% more than they were before. And again, from an NOI perspective, our leads become worth 30%, 40% more, right? So, I think you’re right, it could be a double whammy. But, Mr. Wheeler here has to play the role of Eeyore and he’s going to see it before he’s ever going to talk about it.
Scott Wheeler: Well, there are some positives like you mentioned the renewal pricing increases in your comments, but we’re selling new ads under our new pricing structures that are being sold for 15% to 20% prices higher than we were selling them for in July. And we’re getting hundreds of properties that are coming in, paying those prices. So, to your point, Andrew, we’ve typically seen 10% volume growth over the years, and we have plenty of room to penetrate with volume growth. If you had a nice volume growth kicker on top of a 15% new price card, that’s interesting. Coming from Eeyore. The new Eeyore.
Operator: For our next question, we have Mario Cortellacci from Jefferies.
Mario Cortellacci: Just given all the dry powder that you guys are still holding, I’m just wondering how we should think about the potential timing and maybe even sizing of deals over the next 12 months, or maybe even asked a different way, I guess if your current pipeline -- or with what’s in your current pipeline, could you just give us a sense for how many deals do you think you can close that are maybe more tuck-in in nature? And are there any chunkier deals out there that maybe we’re not seeing in the private market?
Andy Florance: Sure. I appreciate the question, Mario. But -- and as you know, we’re not going to tell you anything that really identifies anything. I can tell you anecdotally, 15 minutes before this call, I picked up the phone, I called Martin Johnson, our Head of M&A, and updated him on 4 or 5 thoughts we had of relatively small companies, but could be nice tuck-ins, they’re strategic. There’s always a big pipeline of strategic things. There’s some that are a little bit bigger. There’s some I think that will get a -- that I think is pretty straightforward and positive that we’re working on, that has nuances that are challenging, but could be interesting. We just turned down a pretty significant deal because -- after due diligence because we felt it was ultimately not the right value and had too much hair on it. But, I think it’s more of a -- right now, what we’re looking at is more deals that sort of enhance the sort of general initiatives you’re well aware of. We’re not looking at anything right now that really jumps us out of the things you’re familiar with, the general strategic themes that our investors are well aware of. But, there are a lot of things that can help us strengthen what we’re already doing.
Operator: For the next question, we have Jeff Meuler from Robert Baird.
Jeff Meuler: For Apartments.com, can you give us some perspective on how the business is performing in any metro areas that are closer to the median for vacancy rates? And I’m talking relative to the historical median or within 1 standard deviation or something to the extent to which they’re out there. And then, historically, how sensitive has the business been to new apartment construction? I recognize that there’s interplay with occupancy rate, but just in terms of the need to advertise to lease up the new builds, and any update on those trends or sensitivities? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Sure. So, just keep in mind one thing, as you consider what’s going on here. If you ever think about the unemployment -- the job creation numbers, you might -- people might be expecting 280,000 new jobs this month. People forget that that is 5 million jobs lost and 5.2 million jobs gained. So, the 200,000 is -- and that’s the same thing here. You might have a relatively small movement in people downgrading, which causes a softness in the apartment sales because they’re so occupied, the under construction side of the business is solid and cranking, and we are at a near all-time high of supply. And those communities always -- I mean, most typically look to Apartments.com to fill up their communities when they hit the market fully vacant. So, that business is as good as it’s ever been. And it doesn’t take a Nobel laureate economist to know that with rents climbing 12% and cap rates going down to 3-point whatever percent that there, you’re going to see more supply, especially in apartments as an inflation hedge. So, I think you’re going to see a lot of activity in land. And I think you’re going to see a lot of activity with people bringing apartments to market as quickly as they possibly can. So, I think that business is going great. In terms of anecdotally, one market versus another, these different markets are gyrating -- doing these spikes in occupancy at slightly different pattern. So, at the beginning -- early stage of pandemic, you saw spikes in say like secondary tertiary cities, like a Richmond or San Diego, and you saw vacancies rise in markets like New York, then you see New York shoot up and occupancy levels down in vacancy. So, they’re all moving around with pretty good volatility. So, we don’t have -- we aren’t really identifying clear cut different trends from one market to another. Just generally, the overall theme is demand for apartments right now is an unprecedented high. And the supply is high, too, but demand is super high, and it’s across the country.
Operator: For our next question, we have Stephen Sheldon from William Blair.
Stephen Sheldon: On the international data opportunity, how important are these commercial marketplaces, Realla and Belbex, and now the recent one in France, to your overall data gathering capabilities in these markets to pull back into the global CoStar data platform? And then, how are you thinking about continuing to expand commercial marketplaces in other countries? And I guess, into regions too, like APAC, could you do that with the existing assets, or will you likely continue to do smaller acquisitions like BureauxLocaux?
Andy Florance: Yes, we’re -- we would -- sort of going backwards there, we would -- as we’ve been for many, many years, we would always be open to looking at good, strong players who have -- are part of the data clearinghouse for the market. These are sort of good, great raw material companies to help build a larger platform with. So, deals like BureauxLocaux, we would keep looking for those. And they are out there around the world. So we keep track of them. Now, in terms of how important are these sites, well, they’re very valuable. I mean, we can go into a market without them, like you can see us creating a marketplace in Spain successfully, but we like to accelerate that growth. And marketplaces generate a lot of high-quality data. Users actually electronically submit a lot of that data. It is well within our wheelhouse. When we pick up like a BureauxLocaux in Paris, we can -- I think we have a good skill set in growing their traffic, coming up with more pricing, more value propositions for their advertisers, more pricing opportunities for revenue driving for us. We usually have the ability to improve their imagery, some of their marketing strategies for their clients. But, we can take the data coming off of BureauxLocaux, and we have already identified maybe 8 or 9 other sources of data that we connect in with that data and build a very robust information tool for the professional community for the investing community. And the marketplace is just something special that gives you unique data. And the more people shopping on that marketplace, the more people want to give you data, the more people give you data, the more people want to shop on that marketplace, and that virtuous circle feeds our information platforms. I also remember one of the things we’re doing here is we are -- we believe that just like the phenomenon we experienced in the United States when you’re selling data in a couple of cities in the United States, your data is valuable, but not wildly valuable. Once you’re selling a footprint of almost the whole United States, the people who find your data, who really operate at a national level, that world grows and your data becomes dramatically more valuable. We’re pursuing that same effect in Europe. Right now, we’re only -- we’re providing solutions in a couple of markets. We think that once we’re providing solutions across the major economies, which we’re really working, making good progress on right now with Germany, France, United Kingdom, Spain and others, that your value proposition will grow and you’ll see more profitability in Europe, more revenue growth in Europe and then globally. We also think we are focused on bringing LoopNet internationally. We believe that it’s a really good product, the way it presents the properties is appealing and has international appeal, where -- I just came back from two days in Paris discussing an excruciating detail how the models changed slightly in various markets and how you have disconnected listings for properties, et cetera, et cetera, and we can incorporate that to LoopNet. I think that LoopNet starts off with a significant advantage. And I think Google takes a whole bunch of positive signals from LoopNet. I can see that in some markets where we don’t -- we barely have any properties in a market outside the United States, and LoopNet performs exceptionally well just because it’s so successful in the United States. So, we are very interested in having both, the local marketplaces like BureauxLocaux, Belbex, Realla but also have the international market with LoopNet. In particular, given the fact that a lot of the appeal of the international marketing platform like LoopNet is cross-border sales, which are big, people can invest in a triple net easily across the border, and they do. So LoopNet will do really well with the for-sale side as it did in the United States as it grew out there. And then, I’m also interested in having Ten-X chase that growth of LoopNet, again because I believe that a very-high percentage of these ultimately successful bidders at Ten-X are actually international audience. So, probably more than you’re asking for, but a couple of thoughts.
Operator: For our next question, we have Mayank Tandon from Needham.
Mayank Tandon: Scott, I was going to ask you may be around margins. As you think about the roadmap to 40% by 2023, does the softness on the Multifamily that I get it, it might be temporary? And then, maybe some of the timing issues that Andy talked about on the Ten-X impact. Does that in any way change your investment programs as you try to get to that target model, or does that remain sort of status quo?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. I don’t think we have really any reason to make major changes in the investment model now. I think margins have performed very well, certainly in apartments this year as we focus some investments in other places, but they’ve been running up on top of the strong marketing they’ve had. Like Andy said, we’ll look at the level of spending there and where they’re most effective going forward. I think the margin profiles are strong. The leverage we’re getting is strong on growth across all the platforms. And so, I think as we balance that into the next years, we’ll see continued funds come available that we can reinvest in the most attractive opportunities and still give great margins compared to obviously many others in the market that don’t like to deliver margins. We still think that’s an important part of our value proposition. So, no real change in speed or course there. And I appreciate you hanging with us Mayank to the last question of the night.
Andy Florance: I think with that, we’re going to wind up the call. Thank you for all the good questions. So, we appreciate you joining us for our third quarter call today. And as we move towards the end of 2021, I can’t believe that we’re actually doing that, but here we are. We’re working towards two important short-term milestones. One is the goal of reaching $1 billion of annualized revenue run rate in our marketplaces by the end of the year. The second is we look forward to crossing the $2 billion revenue run rate for the Company overall, solidly and cleanly. And so, we think the strength of our franchise is clear and the amazing traffic growth, lead growth and high renewal rates we’re showing right now and the successes we’re showing with so many of our product areas and strong sales growth remain focused on growing the core businesses while working to triple our addressable market opportunity through investments in residential and international expansion. So, we look forward to meeting with you again for our fourth quarter call on February ‘22, hang in there. I know it’s a little bit longer than normal quarterly interval, but we’ll be there. Until then, stay safe. And thank you very much for participating.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q2 2021 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Mr. Bill Warmington, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may now begin.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Chris. Good evening and thank you all for joining us to discuss the second quarter 2021 results of the CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar’s CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO; I would like to review our safe harbor statement. Certain portions of the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including the company’s outlook and expectations for the third quarter and full year 2021. Forward-looking statements involve many risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group’s press release issued earlier today and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, include EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are shown in detail in our press release issued today, along with definitions for those terms. The press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com under Press Room. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being webcast, and the link is also available on our website under Investors. Please refer to today’s press release on how to access the replay of this call. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Bill. Good evening, everyone. Good morning to our Asia-Pac employees. And thank you for joining us for CoStar Group’s second quarter 2021 earnings call. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2021 grew 21% year-over-year to $480 million, ahead of the $470 million high-end of our guidance range. Net bookings of $51 million were up to 47% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of a $150 million was well above the $135 million high-end of our guidance range. CoStar Group saw a substantial increase in the demand for the information on our marketplace as evidenced by a 47% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. In total, almost $30 million more people visited CoStar Group websites in the second quarter of 2021 than did the same quarter a year ago. We believe that growth in marketplace audience is a leading indicator of future growth in marketplace subscription revenue. Leading the results, CoStar Suite had its strongest new bookings quarter in years. CoStar Suite bookings in the second quarter of 2021 grew 19% sequentially and were almost 10 times last year’s level at the start of the pandemic. As a result, we expect CoStar Suite organic revenue to return to double-digits by the fourth quarter of this year, well ahead of our expectations just 6 months ago. The commercial real estate economy is a tale of two cities, with examples of both strengths and weaknesses in key indicators. Overall, it feels like the heat economy is driving solid demand for CoStar Suite. CoStar Suite’s quarterly renewal rate for the second quarter of 2021 reached an impressive multiyear high at 94.5%. That’s extraordinarily high. This high renewal rate is all the more impressive, because it does not exclude the solutions of commercial real estate firms as principals and companies normally retire, cease operations. I believe the renewal rate for those clients that remain in business could be approaching 98% plus. Historically, we have sold CoStar on a module basis, offering clients modules covering basic property information, comparable sales, tax information, and various geographical modules covering cities, states or countries. Clients buying just a few product modules for just one geography were only getting a fraction of the value we could offer them. As we’ve grown and as we continue to expand internationally, it requires more and more effort to offer our products as limited modules. Perversely, it costs us more money to offer clients less. Effective this month, we started selling only the full global CoStar Suite product to new clients, which we now simply call CoStar. The CoStar sales team’s primary focus is now upselling our existing clients who currently subscribe to less than our full product, to the full product. There are approximately 18,000 client firms with partial coverage for our sales team to upsell. Through Friday, early days, early stage of the effort, 553 clients have upgraded their CoStar service, generating 111,000 in incremental monthly revenue, an average increase per client of about $200 per month. We expect the upsell process to generate $30 million to $40 million in incremental annual revenue, with encouraging initial results leaning towards the higher-end of that range. These upgrades were more than just an incremental revenue generator. We believe our clients are overwhelmingly more satisfied after they upgrade, as evidenced by increasing Net Promoter Scores. We believe that this may result in even higher renewal rates if that’s possible. Of the almost 300 clients surveyed by our quality assurance team after they upgrade or had a conversation about upgrading, roughly 2/3rds gave us a Net Promoter Score of 9 or 10. Clients certainly didn’t see this upsell as a cost increase, they see it as a value-add to their business. In the first quarter of this year, we integrate CMBS data into CoStar. We have received very positive feedback from our clients in the value of this new content. Since the launch of the CMBS data, our clients have used that detailed loan and financial data extensively, with about 45,000 users accessing the data over 0.5 million times. Later this year, we plan to launch CMBS Analytics, which aggregates CMBS loan and property data by property type across more than 1,000 markets. CMBS Analytics will include loan origination metrics, distressed loan levels, maturity volumes, as well as detailed revenue expense information. And in later releases, we plan to include detailed prepayment information and over 150,000 disposed loans. We estimate that CMBS data has already generated over 1 million of net new annual revenue year to date. Over half of that revenue signing was in the last month of the second quarter and monthly sales continue to increase. We’re also hard at work on a CoStar solution for lenders that leverages the expertise we’ve developed with CoStar Risk Analytics, to support lenders with risk management, underwriting, surveillance and compliance through the CoStar product. CoStar Lender is progressing as anticipated, with plans for a full release in the first quarter of 2022. The first Lender release will focus on portfolio risk analytics and surveillance to help lenders meet regulatory and accounting requirements. Subsequent releases will focus on loan origination and underwriting. We believe these tools have the potential to become the standard for regulatory reporting in the U.S. That said, these lender tools are specialized high-value applications. And so, will be priced at a premium to our standard CoStar offering. In April, we released the first international version of CoStar. This new release integrated our databases for the UK, U.S. and Canada into one system. In addition, we loaded basic information on hundreds of thousands of additional buildings across 200 countries that we obtained through our acquisition of Emporis in October of 2020. In the 60 days since we launched this international product, about 10,000 CoStar users have viewed properties outside their home-country 4.6 million times. We view this as a confirmation of our clients’ need for cross-border property information. We know that trillions of dollars of capital crosses borders to invest in commercial real estate annually, and that global corporations have up to 1 million facilities internationally. We recently gathered a dozen senior CoStar leaders in Iceland for a weeklong summit to evaluate and plan our international growth strategy. Oddly, Iceland is one of the few places where staff from multiple countries can gather without a week of quarantine, so it’s a good spot to meet. We believe there is a clear opportunity to expand CoStar into 50 additional countries over time. We believe we can win tens of thousands of new customers and create much more value for many of our existing clients. We believe that international expansion presents unique opportunity to leverage our scale and expertise. And we’re really excited about that opportunity. Beyond CMBS, CoStar Lenders, student housing, international and hospitality information, we have over 100 additional product enhancements that we have been planning for CoStar over the next 5 years. We believe that these future enhancements will help us win more customers, sell more to our existing customers and increase the value of our service to existing customers. Given the strength we see in CoStar renewals and sales, as well as our clients’ good performance, we are restarting annual price adjustments on CoStar contract renewals in September of this year. LoopNet revenue in the second quarter of 2021 grew 18% year-over-year, driven primarily by a 71% growth in our Diamond, Platinum and Gold Ads, that provide unparalleled exposure and branding benefits for our clients. We also saw LoopNet net new sales growth accelerate 36% in the first quarter of 2021. In the quarter, LoopNet earned the highest renewal rate of annual contracts that we’ve seen in years and possibly ever. We’ve launched a broad-based marketing campaign to enhance LoopNet’s brand, increase our visibility and support our clients who own office properties and their need to bring people back to the workplace. The campaign also serves as a message to commercial real estate owners that LoopNet as a high value marketplace, connecting premier properties with the most valuable tenants and investors. I hope many of you have seen the LoopNet Space for Dreams advertisements broadcast during the PGA Championship or the U.S. Open. Or you may have seen the ads during primetime at CNN, NBC News, MSNBC, CNBC, and many other leading media outlets. In May and June, we’ve delivered over 1 billion high value media impressions across TV, streaming and social channels. I believe that these pieces are both well done and very well received. Office vacancy rates remain elevated by historical standards and LoopNet is uniquely positioned as the ideal marketplace for brokers and owners to market to help fill those painful vacancies. We believe LoopNet with almost 20 times more traffic than our closest competitor is the best commercial real estate marketing solution available. Our Space for Dreams advertising campaign coupled with our enhanced SEM investment and the SEO optimization has led to record average monthly traffic of approximately 10 million unique visitors across our LoopNet network in Q2. Traffic to the LoopNet network of sites is up 33% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. We are seeing quality traffic as well with 887 of the Fortune 1000 companies searching on LoopNet in Q2. The site are also spending 59% more time on the listings this quarter compared to the second quarter 2020. We’ve seen the owners and brokers with the properties that are the best candidates for highest level Diamond and Platinum ads show increased activity on LoopNet with overall search activity from them up about 40% year-over-year. Our investments in e-commerce have yielded positive results with e-commerce sales rising 86% year-over-year based on improvements in the checkout flow and mobile responsive workflows. Today, we are relying on the CoStar salesforce to sell both CoStar and LoopNet, which is suboptimal with the market for the 2 products being so vast. The CoStar salesforce is delivering exceptional results, selling more new business in the second quarter of 2021 than in any quarter over the past 3 years on a combined CoStar-LoopNet product basis, so they’re about as productive as ever been. We continue to believe that we’re in the early stages of a major offline to online shift in marketing commercial property. So we are building the recruiting training leadership and facilities to support a centralized team of professional dedicated LoopNet sellers in Richmond, Virginia. Our first sales class on this new models expect to join the third quarter and grow to 50 or more by the end of the year. We believe the LoopNet brand has so much more growth potential beyond the current business. The online advertising shift is a year’s long journey, so building a strong foundation for the business is critical this year as property as come to view LoopNet as a must have property to – must have to properly market their properties. Our Apartments.com platform continues to deliver unprecedented value to our customers. Our 2021 consumer ad campaign starring Jeff Goldblum has been our most effective campaign ever delivering 4.1 billion impressions in the second quarter alone. The campaign runs across multiple outlets including traditional television and top primetime and sports programs. And we have expanded investments into new outlets including video-on-demand, streaming audio, social media, and new partners such as Twitch, Tik Tok, Esports and more. Aren’t we have? As a result in the second quarter, we saw record network visits up 32% year-over-year to 363 million and record unique visitors up 30% to 177 million. The consumer campaign will continue heavily into Q3 with more top programming. As we’ve already aired in every game in the NBA Finals and are currently running across the Olympics. More and more properties continue to make the decision to advertise on Apartments.com. There are now over 60,500 paying properties on Apartments.com, an increase of 17% since beginning of 2020. In addition, our existing customers are staying with us longer. Our renewal rates have increased over the past 3 years and are now at their highest levels ever. That’s a trifecta, we’ve got LoopNet, Apartments and CoStar at their highest renewal rates. We believe the reason for this is, because we’ve consistently delivered exceptional value to our customers. Site traffic represents by the reach and exposure for our customers’ vacancies. Looking back to the start of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, apartment site traffic has increased significantly with visitors up 48% and visits up 60% for the second quarter of 2021. As a result with high quality consumer leads to our advertised properties have increased whopping 123% since the beginning of March last year, leads are up 123%, because we held our subscription package advertising rates flat during the pandemic. We essentially more than cut in half what we charge our clients on a per lead basis. Our growing competitive advantage in our success and driving such strong traffic and lead growth had the unintended consequence of creating half off sale and reducing organic revenue growth for short period of time. The second quarter 2020, the average client received 80 leads from our lowest ad level Silver. Silver clients needed more leads they often upgrade to our highest ad level Diamond and received on average 118 leads per month. With so much success in traffic and lead growth, the average lead flow from our lowest end to add the silver level surge beyond Diamond to 129 leads per month in the second quarter of 2021. The Silver ad packages generating so many leads clients essentially stopped upgrading to our higher ad level spend packages slowing our organic growth. Fortunately, this is a high-class temporary problem that’s easily solved by adjusting our price per lead upward closer to the level was before the pandemic. We believe conditions are ideal to reduce the discounts in our price per lead demand for apartments, not the dot.com, the actual apartments has increased. Vacancy rates have decreased, eviction moratoriums will soon expire and rents are soaring. For investment grade apartment buildings 3 to 5 star with 100 units plus average rents that started 12% from 1,464 unit in Q3 2020 to $1,634 in Q3 2021. 12% is a pretty big jump in that short of timeframe. The value of investment grade apartment buildings has soared as well. The sales price per door of an apartment building climbs 74% in the second quarter 2020 from a low of 100 to 2,000 per door to a second quarter 2021 price of 263,000. That gives a massive increase in price per door. We believe that turnover apartments is poised to increase as organizations that have been 100% remote returned in office work resulting employees shifting back to the cities they just left that increased churn should drive increased demand for leads. In addition, as landlords raise rents, it drives even more turnover as tenants move to avoid rent increases. We believe that this combined with the fact that we continue every year to deliver more and more value to our customers will allow us to increase our advertising rates for Apartments.com in the third quarter, while still providing the best value per lead our clients have ever seen. We are once again growing our mid-market multifamily salesforce in Richmond, Virginia, a component of this train classes from the Homes.com salesforce as we are repurposing a portion of that team for Apartments.com. And we’re really excited to have almost 30 of these reps join our mid-market sales effort. In total, we expect to more than double the size of our mid-market salesforce by the end of the year. We believe the U.S. apartment market is a $6 billion to $8 billion opportunity and our penetration rate across all segments remains relatively low. Although, our near-term sales and revenue growth rates will be lower than last year, we believe that our exceptional price valued ability to once again grow our salesforce were returned sales and revenue growth a strong double-digit levels. The global hospitality industry is finally seeing an encouraging recovery driven primarily by leisure travel United States. We are seeing positive signs of activity around the world with the number of hotels providing data STR now over 67,000, which is again growing and above the pre-pandemic data contribution levels. STR’s solid performance in spite of the challenging macro backdrop affirms the critical nature of STR state of the hospitality industry. STR’s subscription revenue grew 5% year-over-year on a pro forma basis during the pandemic with renewal rates of 95%. We saw positive net new sales consistently throughout the second quarter. Although, the pandemic stopped the hotel industry in its tracks only 5 months after we acquired STR, our subscription revenues of 10% compared to the trailing 12 months revenue prior to the acquisition. And the 91 days since the release of hospitality performance saving CoStar, we’re seeing strong interest and activity levels. 47,000 CoStar users have performed over 94,000 analytic searches, including views of market, sub-market reports and capital market reports. In total, there have been almost 690,000 hospitality property views. The initial sales effort for this product was focused on training existing subscribers and increasing the number of distinct users at customer locations. At the end of June, we launched a new CoStar sales campaign focused on the new hospitality data prospects. This initial campaign targets 1,200 high quality leads the team of 70 CoStar account executives selected and trained to focus on hospitality owners and brokers is like an elite group of hospitality salespeople. We’ve acquired Ten-X in June 2020, one-year later we’ve transformed Ten-X into a very vibrant transaction platform with a lot of potential with growing traffic and increasing asset volume and size. Ten-X revenue grew 42% year-over-year on a pro forma basis in the second quarter 2021 driven by a 31% increase in average deal size and a 35% increase in transaction volume. Connecting Ten-X to our CoStar platform, increasingly better advertising, and producing our highly successful “Don’t just sell it. Ten-X it” campaign with Michael – Keegan-Michael Key have all contributed to this transformation. Ten-X’s value proposition of speed, certainty and market price is increasingly resonating with buyers and sellers and brokers. We’re making significant progress on both the supply and demand side of the business, which are working together synergistically to produce better results for both buyers and sellers. On the supply side, the number of assets brought to the Ten-X platform grew 30% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2021. And the dollar value of assets grew 80%. But 80% of the assets we closed in the second quarter of 2021 were sold by institutional and private client groups, which is a good proxy for performing assets. So that 80% of the assets were performing. In the second quarter of last year that figure was 59%. So this reflects that continuing transformation of Ten-X from a distressed asset platform into a market rate commercial property sales platform. Though it is ready should there be a surge in distress. The rate card reduction on high value properties we implemented in the first quarter this year is clearly working. We have even with the rate reductions, we have really solid margins on those high value properties. We’re seeing an increasing number of higher value assets brought to the platform. The second quarter we had a $20 million student housing facility, a $120 million multi-building industrial portfolio and a $60 million loan moves to the Ten-X platform. On-demand side traffic grew 18% quarter-over-quarter, and 140% year-over-year. Product detail pages grew 110% year-over-year, and the number of approved bidders was up 150% year-over-year. The average number of bidders per asset, there’s a Ten-X distressed asset in the next property platform, I think, that’s my right. It’s recycling capital. The average number of bidders per asset increased from 2.9% a year ago to 4.4% in the second quarter of this year. The synergistic network effect improving supply and demand is reflected the total assets sold as a percentage of total assets brought to the platform known as the trade rate. Second quarter of 2021, trade rate reached an all-time quarterly high of 74%. Notably, this is about twice the average trade rate for offline property sales. We are adding to the Ten-X salesforce every month and expect to have a sales team of about 60 by year-end are experienced so far is that our sales training combined with our strong product offering is producing highly effective new salespeople. Almost 20% of Ten-X sales pipeline already in the second half of 2021 is from new salespeople hired and trained in 2021. Homesnap had an excellent second quarter growing total revenue of 50% year-over-year and SaaS revenue 46%. Homesnap Pro registered users grew 14% to 750,000. Total agent subscribers grew 80% to 63,000 at the end of the second quarter. Total paying agents grew 52% year-over-year from 53,000 to 81,000. And those agents are spending 35% more in advertising by $80 per year versus $60 per year a year ago. Our residential portfolio now consists of Homesnap the leading real estate productivity and marketing application Homes.com, a well recognized residential marketing portal acquired in just May of this year. A combination of Homes.com as the homebuyers’ portal and Homesnap the agent’s professional platform sets the stage for us to offer sellers, buyers and real estate agents a better more collaborative, online home sale and purchase experience. Once integrated with plan to provide agents with instant access to manage their listings on Homes.com view and respond to inquiries collaborate with clients and provision sophisticated digital marketing campaigns. We believe this direct connection between agents and a consumer portal would be both very unique and very valuable in this industry. We plan to grow Homes.com site traffic by offering homebuyers accurate, real time information straight from local MLS, supported by the best photography and multimedia content possible, along with good agent interaction traffic, in a website empowers homebuyers to collaborate with agents they trust. CoStar groups’ hundreds of talented architectural photographers have brought millions of properties alive for millions of renters with the highest quality photographs, videos and 3D tours. Now this team is committed to providing an immersive and compelling presentation of residential properties on Homes.com. We began integrating homes and Homesnap immediately and have already taken steps to improve the experience for buyers and eliminate price that work gives the agent seller relationship. If you had looked at Homes.com, when we acquired them back in May, you probably noticed there was a little bit of room for improvement on the site. We still have a lot of head work – we have a lot of work ahead for us. But you might be impressed to see how many improvements we’ve already made in just a matter of a month or so on the site. The results are tangible with daily leaves the site of approximately 70% since we first made the improvements about a month ago. Those that comment a large real estate portal sells worse and we are repurposing that to sell Homesnap products to hundreds of thousands of additional real estate agents as well as we’re using them for middle market advertising sales for Apartments.com. In order to build our integrated residential marketplace, we’re planning to increase the level of integration investment in our residential offering in the second half of 2021 by $25 million. Investment is split roughly into between marketing costs, additional technology and content generating resources. We’re calling you today from within our headquarters building. And we’ve seen most of our colleagues in this building today. We’re pleased to report they’re making great progress bringing our employees safely back to work. We believe that being physically in the office is essential to collaboration, productivity and company culture. We evacuated our offices last March, because of a global pandemic, not because of HR innovation that discovered that remote work was more productive. Currently in the U.S., approximately 94% of our employees are vaccinated. And approximately 85% of our employees have come back to the office. When school reopens, we expect our in office numbers to grow as parents have better daycare options. We’re grateful to all of our staff who kept CoStar Group running so well during the challenges of the past year, as CEO feels great to see our staff back to the office together collaborating, learning and growing. I believe that while other companies have yet to come to grips with the challenges of getting their workforce back to full productivity, we’re well ahead of the game at this point. The U.S. economy is experiencing the strongest rebounding growth of the G20 economies. This strength in turn, is fueling a broad-base recovery across the commercial real estate sector with cash in the bank, plenty of accrued vacation time and vaccination cards in hand. Leisure travel is driving recovery in the hospitality sector. Over 70% of U.S. health tells have occupancy about 60% in June, the most since October 2019. In multifamily search activity apartments is trending well above 2020 levels high consumer demand combined with vacancy rates at 20-year lows and limited supply growth is resulting in unprecedented rent growth. Single-family market remains white hot driven by tight inventories and low interest rates. In retail, government stimulus plus wage growth and driven retail sales well above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, both leasing activity and transaction volume and retail surpassed pre-pandemic levels in Q2 2021, while bankruptcies and closures persist, they’re on pace for their lowest levels since 2016, and industrial elevates spending in consumer goods, the rise in e-commerce and the need to expand industrial supply chains drove leasing volumes to all-time highs in Q2 2021, up 40% year-over-year, despite record-high, construction demand continues to outpace supply and produce rent growth of 5% in Q2 2021. Despite negative net absorption, high vacancy rates to office sector is beginning to show early signs of recovery. leasing Volume rose above pre-pandemic level for the first time in Q2 2021. Sublease space growth decelerated as companies realized they might need their office space and occupancy losses moderated. In capital markets, total transaction volume in Q2 2021 increased and actually exceeded Q2 2019’s levels. Q2 2021 deal volume exceeded 5-year averages in multifamily investor and retail, but did lag in office. Distressed sales today are running about half of 2020 levels. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott T. Wheeler. And I suggest the first question of the Q&A would be, “What does the T stand for in Scott T. Wheeler?”
Scott Wheeler: Hmm. I think that’s the mystery we might just have to leave unsolved for the remainder of this call. Then maybe I’ll decide to answer that one. I’ll keep you guessing. All right, well that was a lot of ground to cover in just a short call. Great summary. And that seems like we keep having increasing opportunities with every new component that we add to this business. Fortunately, it’s easy to summarize financially. We delivered another strong set of results this quarter, with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and sales bookings, all growing in the strong double-digit. Our results include a short period of results for Homes.com in the second quarter, which are not material to the overall revenue or profit for this quarter. Revenue in the second quarter of 2021 increased 21% over the second quarter of 2020, coming in above the high-end of our guidance range, with CoStar, Ten-X and Homesnap all exceeding our expectations. Organic revenue growth for the second quarter was 13%, improving from the 11% in the first quarter on the strength of both CoStar and the LoopNet growth improvement. The product, which we now simply will call CoStar, grew revenue 7% in the second quarter of 2021 versus the second quarter of 2020. Improving from 4% growth in the first quarter and exceeding our forecast of 5% to 6%. With very strong sales results, improved renewal rate, the launch of the single CoStar product upsell program, and the planned return of annual renewal price increases in September, the outlook for CoStar continues to improve. We now expect CoStar revenue growth to improve to around 9% in the third quarter and return to double-digit growth in the fourth quarter of this year. This improves our full-year revenue growth outlook for CoStar, on 6% that we talked about last quarter, to approximately 8% this quarter. We fully expect CoStar revenue growth to improve quarter by quarter, and return to the historical growth rates in the 12% to 13% range, as we move into 2022. Revenue in Information Services grew 15% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2021, exceeding expectations for the quarter. Subscription revenue growth remains strong in Real Estate Manager and STR, with both increasing 16% when compared to the second quarter of 2020. Overall, we expect Information Services revenue growth of around 10% in the third quarter and for the full year. Multifamily revenue grew 18% in the second quarter of 2021, at the lower end of our 18% to 19% range. Roughly half of the revenue growth over the year within the second quarter is from new properties advertising with us, and the other half is growth from the average rate per property. As Andy talked about, the rapid increase in lead generation recently is creating a negative sales mix shift, with fewer customers upgrading to higher-level ad packages. This reduced the second quarter sales levels for Apartments.com, which in turn impacts our revenue growth rate outlook for the third quarter. We expect a year-over-year revenue growth rate of multifamily to be approximately 12% in the third quarter of 2021 and to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter as we implement new pricing at the contract renewal times. As the new pricing begins to layer into the revenue every month, we expect revenue growth rates to continue to increase into 2022. Also, the recent shift of Homes.com sellers to the Apartments’ midmarket team and the ability to hire salespeople as the economy reopens are both expected to contribute to improved revenue growth after the third quarter of this year and well into 2022. Commercial property and land revenues grew 73% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2021, well above our expected 55% to 60% growth rate. Both Ten-X and Homesnap delivered revenue above expectations with pro-forma growth of over 40% for Ten-X and 50% for Homesnap. LoopNet revenue increased 18% in the second quarter, compared to the second quarter 2020, slightly below expectations, as the combined CoStar/LoopNet sales-team saw a little less LoopNet and more CoStar than we had assumed. In aggregate, the CoStar/LoopNet sales-team, like Andy mentioned, delivered sales bookings above our forecast in the second quarter and one of the highest levels they’ve generated for a long time. Accordingly, the combined revenue of CoStar and LoopNet was also above our forecast in the second quarter. We expect this combined revenue growth rate of CoStar and LoopNet to continue to improve in the third and fourth quarters ahead of our previous revenue guidance. On a standalone basis, we are forecasting LoopNet revenue growth of around 15% for the second half of this year, as we assume that the CoStar/LoopNet sales-force will be focusing on more CoStar sales and not quite as many LoopNet sales in the second half, and while we build our standalone sales-force. Overall, we expect to report commercial property and land revenue growth rate to be approximately 50% for the third quarter and for the full year of 2021. Organically, we expect growth of approximately 17% to 18% for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2021. Our gross margin came in at 81% in the second quarter of 2021, in line with our expectations. And we expect gross margins to continue at that level through the end of the year. Net income was $61 million in the second quarter, and our effective tax rate was 35%. The effective tax rate includes an incremental impact of around 10% related to a modification to our international tax structure. This change only affects the second quarter and we expect the effective rate to drop back down into the mid-20% range for the rest of the year. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $150 million. Adjusted EBITDA was up 17% from the second quarter of last year and came in approximately $15 million above the high-end of our guidance. Resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 31% is 300 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range. It’s improved adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of higher revenue, some timing variances for our marketing spend, and lower-than-expected hiring in the second quarter. Most of the cost favorability in the second quarter will reverse in the second half of the year due to the timing of our marketing, and growth in our sales teams that we expect and investments in our emerging residential business. Now, look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter, starting with our sales-force. Our sales-force totaled approximately 905 people at the end of the second quarter, an increase around 64 people from the second quarter of 2020 and up little over 70 people from the first quarter of 2021. The growth is primarily due to the addition of the Homes.com sales team. The majority of which we have deployed to sell Homesnap products and mid-market Apartments products. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the second quarter of 2021 was 92%, up from 90% last quarter and 89% a year ago. People are really hanging onto our product. This renewal rate is the highest since the third quarter of 2014 and is a strong testament to the mission-critical nature of our product, and the success of our continued investment in our platform. The renewal rate for the quarter for customers who’ve been subscribers for 5 years or longer was 97%, an increase from their renewal rate of 96% in the first quarter of 2021. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounted for 77% of our revenue in the second quarter, a decrease of 1% from the last quarter as a result of adding Homes.com to our metric. I’ll now talk to our outlook for the full year in the third quarter of 2021. We are reconfirming, revising and slightly improving our revenue guidance for the year, and raising the range to include Homes.com. We expect full year revenue in a range of $1.940 billion to $1.950 billion, which implies annual growth rate of 70%. at the midpoint of the range. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $495 million to $500 million, representing revenue growth of 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. For the full year of 2021, we have revised our outlook to include the previously announced adjusted EBITDA loss of $15 million for Homes.com, along with an incremental $25 million of investment in our residential business that Andy mentioned. Approximately half of this investment is related to marketing and agent engagement with the other half related to technology, development resources and content generation. Accordingly, the full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $605 million to $650 million, which implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of 31% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $130 million to $135 million in the third quarter of 2021, on adjusted EBITDA margin between 26% and 27%. The third quarter marks the highest quarter of our marketing spend, as we all have Apartments.com, LoopNet and Ten-X marketing campaigns running throughout the third quarter. Overall, we had a very strong first half of this year, and it’s great to have the heavy lifting of returning to work almost behind us. I’m certainly encouraged by the continued strong rebound of CoStar and the great growth potential that we have in our marketplaces of Apartments, LoopNet, and our new residential businesses. Thank you, everyone, for your continued support. And operator, we can now open the call up for questions with a few rules from our friend, Bill Warmington. Bill, back to you.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Scott. Chris, would you please assemble the questions for the Q&A session?
Operator: Yes, sir.
Bill Warmington: And please limit yourself to one question and make it a good one.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sterling Auty of J.P. Morgan Chase. Your line is open.
Sterling Auty: Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. First of all, my guess on Scott T. Wheeler is I’m going to go with T for Thomas. Am I close?
Scott Wheeler: Wow. Timothy would be good.
Andrew Florance: He knows how to use Google very effectively for this question. I’m not sure what – good job, Sterling.
Sterling Auty: Thank you. And for my one question, the most popular question I get is, everyone, sees the investment that you’re looking to make in residential. And I think they agree with the opportunity. But they don’t know how to think about that investment in the context of your previous 2023 margin target of 40% for EBITDA. Can you maybe give us an update on how we should think about it? And is that target is still viable?
Scott Wheeler: Yeah, good to hear from you, Sterling. Question comes up frequently, with the investments, we just talked about, additional resources and some marketing, as we build this platform out, we are still online to hit our 2023 targets. And we still consider those the marching orders for the business. And so, we need to get through the integrations, watch the site improvements. Andy mentioned the traffic, via visitors, improvements in the site. A lot of these things are going to depend on what happened for the rest of the year in our integration program. And then, we’ll decide what next year’s plan look like relative to investment in residential versus our other platforms. So no change to our 2023 guidance. Right now, all our plan is for residential. We’ve just talked about. We can still make those numbers and intend to, based on what we have so far. And if that changes or new estimates come our way, we will let you know.
Andrew Florance: And I would want to deflate the question a little bit, by pointing out that 100%, the core business of CoStar Group is solidly on target for that goal. And should there be a clear opportunity to invest in what would be a significantly different business, we’ll communicate that at the point that we are doing that. But the fundamental business is definitely on track for those goals. And it’s performing really well. So it’s probably a little bit hyperbolic. I don’t know what that means, but it sounded good.
Sterling Auty: That sounds like backend loaded to me, but I just want to make sure. All right.
Andrew Florance: Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: You bet.
Andrew Florance: It sounds like [indiscernible] Thomas.
Scott Wheeler: Thanks, [Colin] [ph].
Operator: Your next question comes from Pete Christiansen of Citi. Your line is open.
Peter Christiansen: Good evening, guys. Thanks for the question. I was just wondering if we could dig into the LoopNet performance a little bit more here. Obviously, the sales growth there is clearly coming from the Silver Ads. And you did point out, obviously, the CoStar Suite guys are doing double duty here, which is likely making an impact. But, I guess, I would presume that, A, you have an easy comp and real estate activity is improving quite dramatically. I’m surprised that the Silver Ads are decelerating so much. I was just wondering if you could put a little bit more color on, maybe I don’t understand the relationship exactly to what’s going on in the sales-force and what’s going on in the broader market. That would be helpful. Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So a couple of core issues. One is, I mean, so you’re correct to point out that the economy is great. The product is performing really well. The product looks really good. The traffic is fantastic. The marketing is well received. We are limited by how fast we can scale that sales-force. And as you listen to the earnings call, you hear we’re adding salespeople in this bucket and that bucket, and we’re clearly hiring a lot of sales people. And that’s great news, because we have opportunity for them. Our primary focus is on those upper end ads. We don’t want to just keep on selling the low-end ads forever. And we would like to within the next year, come up with a more optimal way to sell those entry-level ads where we don’t charge the same price for all properties in all geographies. And we’d rather shift to a more demand-based pricing algorithm on those on the Silver Ads. So we are holding off driving a lot of activity in there until we can do that. There are some areas where we want to reduce our prices on Silver Ads, and many others where we want to significantly increase our prices on Silver Ads. So if you look at Apartments.com, the average Silver Ad is probably 8 times the average LoopNet Silver Ad. And we want to basically move towards a way of rebalancing that while reducing the prices on some, and then increasing on some other areas, where people wouldn’t notice that even happened. So it’s more of an evolving dynamic. But the fundamental marketplace is super strong, and we’re hitting the things we’re trying to hit with that right now.
Scott Wheeler: And, Pete, if I can just add a couple of the numbers on top of that. The Lister revenue that you mentioned, Silver Ads is about 75% of the revenue for LoopNet. And it’s still growing, it’s growing at mid-single digits. And with Signature Ads growing 70%, we talked about that, mixes into that 18% growth rate for the second quarter. So it’s still growing. It’s just at a smaller level right now. It’s not the primary focus.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Chu of Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Chu: Hi, thanks, guys. So, bookings have clearly rebounded off like the COVID lows, just wondering what it takes to get back to like the prior peak, which I think was in second quarter 2019 of like, 59 million. Is it really a recovering Apartments? And then, just based on the macro environment, when do you think this will be achievable?
Andrew Florance: I think the quarter you mentioned, all cylinders were cranking. So you had a great quarter for Apartments, LoopNet. Apartments, LoopNet and CoStar, we also have other contributors now like Homesnap and Realla, Belbex, BizBuySell, CoStar Real Estate Manager, Thomas Daily, Land, are all cranking. Say, you have a lot of different things happening here. I think there is – you are in an organizational flux or trying to get past us a return to work or return to normalcy. There is a lot of adjustments going on. And we’re getting back into a growth mode, and you want to have all your sales-forces lined up, and you want to get your price per lead numbers, right. But I think that could happen, in the next 2 quarters. We have a lot of good things going on, and all the products are really solid. So I think it’s just a question more of transition and friction in this environment right now.
Scott Wheeler: And, David, when you look at where we are now, and the bookings, sales, like we said the CoStar/LoopNet sales-force produced the highest level for quite some time. So those are very strong and we talked about this. The multifamily piece, if multifamily sales go up to this and, say, the average we were doing in 2019, we would have had our best quarter ever in bookings. And the other thing that Andy mentioned, the Ten-X and Homesnap are 2 brand new businesses that we have. And they’re not accounted in the subscription metrics, because Ten-X is all transactional and Homesnap as a large piece of other we considered transactional at this stage, before we convert our residential offerings to subscription style businesses. So right now, we have about 91% of our revenue is subscription. And that typically had been up in the 95%, 96% plus range. So there is a growth element we have right now in our business, it’s coming from Ten-X and Homesnap that you’re not going to see in the bookings right now until we convert those to subscription. So you get a little lift out of that versus the numbers we talked about. But really it’s the price we talked about in multifamily that should return that to better sales numbers, and that would move us upward.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Campbell of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
John Campbell: Hey, guys, good afternoon.
Andrew Florance: Good afternoon.
John Campbell: Hey, just back to the residential side, Andy, I’m guessing there’s a way to, I guess, more meaningfully build out the traffic there without relying solely on the ad spend to get you there. But, I think you might have submitted that in the commentary around the kind of even split of investments in across the marketing and content in the back half. But, I know for competitive reasons, you guys aren’t going to fully show your hand there; but, Andy, to what extent you can maybe just provide a kind of high level peak into that strategy?
Andrew Florance: You’re right about not wanting to show our hand. So thank you for the opportunity. But you know what we’re offering is really quite simple, really brutally simple, which is 90% of the real estate transactions in the United States; a buyer collaborates with an agent. And if you look at our website right now, Homes.com, it’s all of a month old, so it’s not going to be a masterpiece. But if you look at that website, it’s got something really unique. It’s the only website that I’m aware of the United States where you can actually look at a property for sale and see – clearly see the name and phone number, the agent, push a button and contact them. So, that puts a million real estate agents on our site. And those million real estate agents are involved in 90% of all transactions and communicate regularly with our clients. So we’re excited about that opportunity. We love the fact that it’s so simple, most people can’t understand it. And we’re not afraid to work, if we think there’s a fantastic ROI that have a fantastic return for our shareholders. We’re not afraid to invest in it, but we are – right now, we’re working on the software, and the fundamental structures, which are not wildly expensive. And as I mentioned, 4 weeks of work and the lead flows up 70%. So that’s the first stare of many, but I think that as it evolves, and we can talk more with analysts, investors about the progress we’re making and the vision we have for it, I think that people will support our initiatives. But it’s still, we don’t have some secret magical plan that we’re laying out for 2022 or 2023, right now, we’re dealing with orders of magnitude, we’re more focused on software and strategy right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.
Andrew Florance: Good afternoon.
George Tong: Apartments.com revenue growth decelerated in the quarter, because in the effective reduction in price per lead, can you elaborate a bit more on initiatives to help reverse this trend? And when you would expect to return to 20% plus multifamily revenue growth?
Andrew Florance: Well, that’s an excellent question, George. I think that’s the question. The lead per ad at the lowest level was unimaginable. If I had told someone 4 years ago or 5 years ago, the number of leads the site is generating at the lowest ad level, it would have been implausible, no one could have believed that. So we are helping some very large properties generate a lot of revenue for very little money. And what we’ve done is worked with the leadership team at Apartments.com, and we are rolling out a new pricing strategy. And we’re also adjusting the lead flow, the nature of the product and how it throws lead to meter them more effectively to the upper end ads. And we’re also doing more strata in the price and structure between the 80 unit property, the 100 unit property, the 200 unit property, the 300 unit property more appropriately reflect the value of one of these super high lead generating ads. So it’s pretty easy to go after and it will take, we’re not – it will be something that rolls out in the course of 12 months, and it begins rolling out as early as next month, so you’ll see an advantage there. But this is fundamentally really good news, I mean, this is – there’s 2 kinds of things you could have, problems you could have, one is you don’t have the traffic, don’t have the leads; and the other issue of way too many leads, and clearly our competitive position has gotten very strong recently. And it’s been getting stronger and stronger, but it’s gotten really strong over the last couple of quarters. So we will throw more power to the dynamo will take more friction off the engine and throw more power to the wheels, the next couple of quarters and you’ll see us return to those growth rates as we go into 2020 and it’s sustainable for a long time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Tomasello of KBW. Your line is open.
Ryan Tomasello: Thanks for taking the question. I guess, just following up on Apartments.com. I’m curious, how you’re – Andy, how you’re thinking about the growth outlook there beyond the near-term disruption and say over the next 3 to 5 years of backlog forms growth [Technical Difficulty] plus unit category and understanding the comments around the right sizing of the effective price rallied. But how are you thinking about managing the business as growth at the high end inevitably starts to slow? And in particular, when you expect the middle market business really start to bridge that gap? How large of a business do you think that could be and what types of growth rates are you investing for in that piece of the market over the next few years.
Andrew Florance: So, I actually don’t think the high-end slows for many, many, many, many years, if not decades. We still are 50% penetrated the high end, and we have many products and services we can provide, if you see us getting into more, more actively facilitating the actual leases. If you look at a price per lead that at the lower end was as little as $2 to $3, or if you were to say 1 to 7 ratio lead the lease, $14 per lease. I would not say that we’re within decades of maxing out the value of those leads. And those leads as we can bring to the table where as many as hiring communities are paying a month rent or 2 weeks rent, or $300 or $500 per lease, and we’re charging $14 to $15 per lease. So we’re not going to max out the high end, but it’s really exciting, what’s available in the middle and lower end, we’re successfully selling a lot of properties at the 5 unit level, the 4 unit level, the 20 unit level, the 50 unit level, and we’re in single-digit growth or single-digit penetration all those areas. So it’s a question of continuing to grow the salesforce to go after that opportunity, but then also to build out our e-com capabilities to capture without having to have manual intervention. So it’s a great place to be, and we – and the demand side came out as harder than we ever would have anticipated in the last 2 quarters. But that’s good news. It does have to change the model a little bit. So I think you’ve got a decade plus of good solid 20% growth.
Scott Wheeler: And Ryan, when you look at the universal properties out there over 100, right now, they’re growing faster than we can add them to our portfolio just given the growth in the general universe that we watched. So actually, our presentation into the upper end has stayed at 50% or 51% for like 5 or 6 quarters despite our growth, just because of the growth in the universe of properties out there. So we’ve got a long ways to go just to penetrate the top one, let alone move up those penetrations in the lower one.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mario Cortellacci: Hi, guys, thanks for the time.
Andrew Florance: Hi, Mario.
Mario Cortellacci: Hi, thank you. On CoStar suite, I guess, just how much closer are we getting to turning pricing back on there. Obviously, I know, you’re very focused on the upsell, I mean, you have the global product, and there’s a lot of opportunity there. But I believe that you guys talked about looking for the ability within the commercial real estate market before kind of looking that pricing switch. So maybe you can just talk about what timing looks like there. And then how much price is being baked into the 2021 guide for CoStar suite.
Andrew Florance: Okay. So when are we going to begin normal price escalations on CoStar suite, wait for it now. Yeah, so we’re doing that now. You have to – there’s a notice period on these contracts so that you have a delay. But clearly the conditions are right for it right now with renewal rates moving in 94.5%, 5-year clients up over 97%. And all the functionality we’re putting into the product and all the functionality we’re going to put in the product over the next couple of years. We absolutely should be accelerating our pricing at least in line with inflation. And I think it’ll be 200 to 300 basis points above that number. And so, I’m not sure what Mr. Thomas has baked into the guidance, but I’ll let him handle that.
Andy Thomas: Yeah, thank you. Yeah, the start of the increases that go in the next couple of months, go in on renewals, obviously, so it takes a little while to layer them in. So that’s about 100 basis points, I think to the growth in the fourth quarter, but then it really starts to build in next year. But keep in mind that we’re doing the conversions to the full CoStar product, and so 18,000 of our clients will be getting those increases, which are larger than the renewal price increases, until then the other clients will get the renewal price increases. So, in aggregate, we’re looking at some pretty good pricing lift going into next year.
Andrew Florance: Yeah, we’re not increasing those 18,000 people’s prices. We’re offering them incredibly attractive terms to expand their purchasing with us.
Andy Thomas: Actually, they like – they look at it as a decrease in price…
Andrew Florance: Yeah, it’s a decrease in price.
Andy Thomas: The price of CoStar nationally, previously was much higher. So they’re like, “Wow, let’s go get this. This is a good bargain.” So it’s actually working pretty well so far.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. Your line is open.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi, thanks. I want to ask a little bit more about the CoStar suite, and that upselling process. I think that you talked about from modules to the full global suite. I guess, how aggressive do you plan to be in that upselling motion? And would you also plan to sunset the module, I guess, pricing with existing customers at some point. And then, I think you also noted $30 million to $40 million in potential incremental revenue. Can you provide some more detail on that number? Is that the potential revenue uplift at all of your suite customers move to that full solution? Just any more detail there.
Andrew Florance: Yeah, so the $30 million to $40 million, I think is some modeling that our VP of Sales has done, and it assumes the cancellation rate is just gone after that 18,000. It’s assuming an average price increase. So I wouldn’t have the act, the details of the model I’ve reviewed and seeing that model. In terms of how aggressive we would be with it, I would look at some of our prior efforts to move people onto a common platform. And in those prior efforts, we sell very aggressively for 12 to 18 months. And once we’ve had success in moving the majority of the revenue into the unified platform, then we typically sunset the prior platform, because at that point, you’re spending money. You’re spending money that really isn’t adding value anybody to maintain 2 separate platforms. So our goal is to focus on intensively for 12 to 18 months, and then streamline the product and have one version of the product. And that’s sort of somewhat similar to what a Bloomberg does? We’re not buying Bloomberg by geography and a bunch of different modules, you’re getting one terminal. As we go more international, we think it differentiates us against any sort of competitor and provides a very unique value proposition having one platform.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Meuler: Yeah, thank you. So, I guess I’m still struggling a little with the magnitude of the deceleration and Apartments’ revenue going into Q3. I guess, can you just maybe first comment on Apartments.com client retention, specifically, I caught the overall retention, but it sounds like that’s pulled up by really good results in Suite. And then, if retention is stable, I guess, does it come to a head now, because Q2 is seasonally when you normally see clients trade up, and then that trade-up just didn’t happen? And when it doesn’t happen, it’s kind of the season that you expected. That’s why you have the meaningful deceleration going into Q3.
Andrew Florance: Yeah, so to be clear, the renewal rate on Apartments.com is the highest it’s ever been. It is extremely high. Scott will have the number. I think I threw it in there, I’m not sure. But I believe it is 1/10th of the cancellation rate on a monthly basis from where we started in 2015. So, the churn is down 90%. And during the pandemic, it wasn’t really an environment to jack prices aggressively. And so, you sort of came out of pandemic after the first quarter, and after vaccinations really got out there. And then, the markets lit on fire. So it’s a question of how fast you can respond to that. And we will respond very quickly. But I think that I don’t think it’s really just a one quarter of upsell, that doesn’t happen again. I think that, I believe that as people go into the churn, as people have to migrate back to where they were before to return to work, and as people churn, as these price increases continue to crank in these apartment buildings. And as eviction moratorium relieves, our customers are making good money and need more lead flow than ever. And I think there is plenty of opportunity to capture value next quarter, the following quarter, the quarter after that and ongoing from there. So it’s more of a, if you’re playing the game for the long haul, you don’t want to jack people’s prices during the pandemic. But we’re well positioned to capture that value now.
Scott Wheeler: And just the renewal rates 94% for the quarter on multifamily, which is the highest it’s ever been. And then to your point, you recall last year, we had the surge in the second quarter of sales in Apartments to these record levels given the pandemic. And so, that second quarter surge annualizes off in the second quarter this year. So you have a little bit of a cliff effect when you hit the third quarter, because all that weight of those sales goes away. And we haven’t repeated that same sales level in any quarter since then. So you’ll have some of that on annualizing before you then look at the upsells that weren’t as strong in the second quarter of this year. So it’s the difference in the growth rate in the second – in the third quarter it’s around $6 million to $7 million, which on an annualized basis is around difference in that sales level between Q2 this year and last year. So that’s mathematically how it all works.
Andrew Florance: And the number one thing to focus on, if you’re looking at a business like this is that 47% year-over-year growth in unique visitors, that is basically your leading indicator of future revenue.
Scott Wheeler: Yeah. And, of course, the whole platform is still adding more volume. New people are still coming on time from Apartments. And then fortunately, when you have these issues that we work through that we’ve got a great portfolio, where Ten-X and Homesnap, the rest of the business does remarkably well, we ended up holding, if not, increasing slightly our revenue guidance for the year on an aggregate basis, which is obviously what we want to do and continue to do.
Operator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over back to Andy. You may proceed.
Andrew Florance: Thank you. So we appreciate you joining us for the second quarter call today. I hope you share our enthusiasm for the abundance of growth drivers in our business. As we’ve discussed, CoStar Suite in a strong rebound and growing record net sales. Apartments’ record traffic growth and lead flow puts us in a position to begin to share more of the value we’re creating for our customers. LoopNet is growing traffic, revenue and our primary goal of driving revenue signature ads is happening and happening well. Ten-X is really fantastic, gaining great traction. And Homesnap and Homes are well on their way in the process of transforming how agents, consumers buy and sell residential real estate. We didn’t have time to talk about Realla, Belbex, BizBuySell, CoStar Real Estate Manager, Thomas Daily, Land, they’re all doing fantastic as well. And I wish one day they’d give me 2 hours for the call. As we move to the second half of 2021, we’re working towards 2 important milestones. One is our goal of reaching $1 billion of annualized revenue run rate in our marketplaces by the end of the year. And the second is we’re going to run through our $2 billion revenue run rate overall. So some good milestones on our way to much larger numbers. But we’re clearly strong in our core business right now as evidenced by our amazing traffic growth, our amazing renewal rates. And we’re focused on building that core business, but also working to triple our addressable market opportunity through investments in residential and international expansion. So we look forward to meeting with you again for our third quarter call in October 26. And until then, stay safe. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2021 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Bill Warmington, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Gabriel. Good evening, and thank you all for joining us to discuss the first quarter 2021 results of CoStar Group.

And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Bill. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's first quarter 2021 earnings call. We had a strong start to 2021 with both revenue and profit ahead of forecast. CoStar Suite had its best sales quarter since 2019 and is positioned for accelerating revenue growth into 2022. Apartments.com delivered its seventh sequential quarter of revenue growth above 20% year-over-year.  Our Q1 marketing campaigns for LoopNet and Ten-X are hitting the ground running, with both businesses showing good traction. In residential, Homesnap's first quarter pro forma revenue grew over 40% year-over-year as paid subscribers more than doubled and subscription revenue grew 68%. Two weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire Homes.com, the next incremental step in building out our differentiated residential strategy. Overall, we remain highly confident in our ability to continue to deliver double-digit organic growth revenue for many, many years to come. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $458 million, which is a 17% year-over-year growth rate and $3 million ahead of the high end of our guidance range given in February. Quarterly sales bookings were a solid $52 million. Our profit performance was equally strong with adjusted EBITDA of $160 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year and $15 million above the high end of our February guidance.  As a result, we are modestly raising our full year 2021 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance. But you'll hear more about that interesting news from our CFO, Scott Wheeler. CoStar Suite had its best net new sales quarter since 2019, and we appear to be moving past the pandemic disruption. We believe the combination of renewals returning to the high pre-pandemic levels, new product introductions with CMBS, STR international and Lender and the global CoStar upselling effort positioned CoStar Suite for accelerating revenue growth into 2022. Three CoStar Suite product enhancements both improve the utility of the product for all users and expand the universe of potential users.  New users often sign up because of a specific feature or use case, but they often renew because of the power of the overall platform. By the end of this week, we will upload into CoStar information on over $1 trillion of outstanding commercial loans made to over 100,000 properties. Since we began including CMBS data in CoStar Suite, the supporting marketing campaign has reached the target audience with 45 million impressions and 1.3 million views of the CoStar CMBS product video. The CMBS data has helped open the doors to prospects and land multiple new accounts. The inclusion of STR's hotel data in CoStar Suite is following a similar pattern. Before STR, CoStar Suite had minimal data on hotels. Beginning on April 1, CoStar Suite subscribers received access to highly detailed data on 90,000 new and enhanced hotel properties. Since then, the STR data has been generating about 8,000 views per day. The sales force began marketing the STR data to existing clients on April 12 and is successfully adding new CoStar Suites. The next wave of sales activity will focus on targeting nonclients beginning later in Q2. The major capital flows are regularly cross-border, and one of our goals at CoStar is to align information flow with capital flow. Our strategy with international is to start a mile wide in terms of geographic coverage and several inches deep in terms of data and then continuously and consistently add depth over time. On April 22, all subscribers to our highest CoStar Suite subscription level with national coverage received access to information on 500,000 additional international properties in over 200 countries.  Our plan is to steadily grow our international coverage at a measured pace over the years to come. We plan to launch CoStar Suite in Montreal, France this summer and CoStar Suite in Madrid and El Espanol later in this year. In 2022, we are planning to establish deeper research coverage in additional European markets, including such as Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, Rome and Milan. If travel access to overseas markets open sooner, we may accelerate the expansion pace incrementally.  In the second half of this year, we also plan to launch full global coverage of hospitality in CoStar Suite. Our goal is to track every significant commercial real estate property listing, transaction and participant possible around the world while providing customers with the best local marketing experience or cross-border global access based on their needs. Over the past 30 years, we've sold CoStar subscriptions on a modular basis with a wider range of geographical coverage options. Customers have subscribed to our property information module, a light version of our property module or a comparable sale module, or a tenant module or a suite of all the modules. 10,000 firms subscribe to just the city they operate in, with 1,000 subscribing to just the state and only a few thousand subscribing to full national coverage. We believe that as we continue to expand our geographic coverage and functionality, we can better serve our customers and create more value by offering one comprehensive global solution with all the modules included to all of our customers.  Over the course of the next 18 months, we are commencing a focused effort to upsell and migrate our clients to this global suite product. The standardization of options should reduce support costs, simplify the selling process, facilitate pricing discipline, eliminate technical debt. We also believe that in providing more comprehensive value, we can also increase our renewal rates. Today, only 17% of our clients subscribe to our most comprehensive offering, so the upselling effort can create an opportunity for tens of millions of dollars in incremental subscription revenue. Decades ago, we went through a similar successful streamlining process as we moved from being a small regional company to being a national company.  Now as we move into a more global footprint, we're again streamlining to facilitate growth. This strategy is similar to Bloomberg's successful comprehensive nonmodule offering strategy. We believe that as we offer rarely accessible accurate information on more and more segments of real estate, covering more and more geographies, our clients have consistently expanded their business into the incremental revenue opportunities we presented by giving them these broader information solutions. Through the years, I have observed many brokers who once transacted one property type in 1 or 2 neighborhoods, grow their business and then covering multiple segments across multiple cities.  Previously, brokers would have simply referred deals to other brokers if it was not in their geography. But by upgrading their Costar Suite subscription from a single market to national and international, they can now pursue these deals themselves.  Once their business grows into these new broader opportunities, we become an even more important partner in their success. In early 2022, we plan to launch a powerful new CoStar product for the banking sector: CoStar Lender, an all-in one suite for loan underwriting, surveillance, risk management and regulatory reporting tool. There are over 10,000 banks and credit unions in the U.S. with CRE exposure. And we currently do business with less than 10% of them. We believe Lender has the potential to generate over $300 million in incremental annual revenue. Lender will enable banks to link the collateral behind their loans to CoStar property and our independent market information. The product is being designed with input from U.S. regulators and includes a built-in version of the CoStar COMPASS credit default model that enables banks to forecast expected loss and probability of default for easy current expected credit loss, or CECL, reporting. The combination of increasing renewal rates, a robust new product pipeline and the simplification and standardization of the product options all position CoStar Suite for really strong accelerating revenue growth into 2022. When we acquired Apartments.com in 2014, it had less than $80 million in annual revenue and was growing at approximately 10% per year. In this first quarter of 2021, Apartments.com grew revenue 21% year-over-year, its seventh quarter in a row of growth at or above 20%. With a current run rate of over $660 million, I'm proud to say that Apartments.com is on track to overtake CoStar Suite as the largest component of our business in 2021. This strength is particularly impressive given 2 challenges created by the pandemic.  The first is that the apartment owners and managers continue to operate under the budget, occupancy and cash flow restrictions of an eviction moratorium currently scheduled to expire at the end of June. And the second is that we had to suspend the build-out of our promising middle market sales team that was successfully selling into and penetrating the massive lower end of the rental market. We have launched Apartments.com most comprehensive marketing plan ever with Jeff Goldblum returning as Brad Bellflower, our iconic spokesman and the inventor of the Apartminternet. Hopefully, many of you enjoyed our commercial Sunday night during the Oscars. Mr. Goldblum's character demonstrates the limitless lengths to which Apartments.com will go to ensure we have the most listings so that every renter can find their perfect new home. Sunday night's focus on friendly apartments is an awesome spot and a really quality piece of creative work. This year's campaign will feature 7 new TV spots and over 20,000 commercials on top prime time shows, premieres and finales as well as major sporting events, including premier placement on the Olympics this summer.  Let's hope that all goes off without a hitch. We estimate the campaign will deliver over 10 billion media impressions, including twice the video-on-demand, millions of ads on streaming audio and podcast stations, including Pandora, iHeart Media and Amazon and hundreds of millions of social media and digital ads on Facebook, TikTok, Vox and Cargo as well as entering new outlets like esports and livestream on Twitch. I really believe that this is Jeff and our agency's best creative work yet, and the distribution is the most powerful we've ever deployed. I believe our Apartments.com marketing effort is operating at 214.2%. The Apartments.com network continues to make tremendous traffic gains as consumers view our advertising and experience our site. During the first quarter of 2021, the Apartments.com network, according to comScore, had 25 million average monthly unique visitors to our websites, up 4 million uniques or 21% from the same period last year.  During the same period, RentPath had 9.8 million average monthly uniques to its -- for its network of sites, up only 400,000 uniques from the first quarter of last year. In other words, we have over 2.5x RentPath's traffic and then grew our uniques by 10x the number they grew their uniques. They continue to fall further and further behind. Zillow, interestingly, actually lost over 2 million average monthly unique visitors quarter-over-quarter. We are now ahead of Zillow by over 5 million average monthly uniques for the quarter. In the month of March, in the back of our new marketing campaign, the Apartments.com network had 26 million visitors, up 40% year-over-year, and set an all-time record for visits in a month at 78 million visits, up 45% year-over-year. As we head into the peak apartment leasing season, there are more people looking online to rent an apartment than ever before, and our share of that traffic is higher than ever before. We are continuing to see good progress in our penetration of the under 100-unit multifamily properties, both through our small and mid-market sales team based in Richmond, Virginia and our self-service e-commerce offerings to our independent owners.  We define independent owners as folks who own 1 or more 1 to 5 unit properties. The revenue growth rate for buildings with 5 to 100 units has been accelerating from the low 20% range in the first quarter of 2020 to the mid- to upper 30% range in the first quarter of this year. We are excited that a portion of our 2021 marketing campaign will specifically target the massive but underpenetrated independent owners' marketplace for the first time. Our current offering of rental tools, including applications, screening, leases and payments is proving to be extremely valuable to these people.  In the first quarter, over 80,000 applications were submitted on Apartments.com with credit checks resulting in over 27,000 new leases, a 14,000% increase over the same period last year. Apartments.com processed $891 million in rental payments in the first quarter, up 27% from the first quarter last year. As our marketing for these features accelerates, we look forward to expanded sales opportunities. With the now widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines, we're better positioned to restart the hiring and effective face-to-face training of new mid-market sales team members. The normalization of business use of Zoom creates much better opportunities that couple the benefits of a centralized sales force with the effectiveness of virtual face-to-face client presentations. We are still only single-digit penetrated into the vast lower end of this rental marketplace. So we believe very strongly that we have decades of high-growth runway ahead here. In the same way that Apartments.com revenue overtook CoStar Suite in 7 years, I believe Homes.com revenue could overtake Apartments.com revenue in the next 7 years. And that's not because we're expecting any slowdown in Apartments.com growth, quite the contrary. It's because the opportunity in residential is so large, our strategy is so differentiated and our assets have so much potential.  We believe there's a huge gap today between how the leading portals currently leverage the digital real estate marketplace opportunity and an optimal way to leverage digital marketplaces to more effectively sell homes online. We think the current online players are overly focused on capturing agents' fees. But in contrast, we believe there's a bigger and lower risk opportunity to facilitate selling homes faster and with greater certainty by digitally empowering the established and entrenched channels. We recognize and are comfortable with the fact that our initial market position is, in fact, modest today. Two weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire Homes.com from Dominion Enterprises. Back in 2018, Dominion sold us ForRent. Thank you, Rusty. Members of the ForRent team became key members of our Apartments.com team that helped build that business. Homes.com will similarly bring with it a talented team of managers and an excellent intuitive URL with an existing base of residential traffic. We believe that our plans to combine Homes.com, Houses.com and the agent marketing and workflow tools of Homesnap and even CoStar will create the foundation of a differentiated solution to offer a much better alternative to the old, first-generation real estate web portal models.  Not sure where to put it in the call but somewhere, you have to admire, at least appreciate, the branding benefit of how Homes.com meets -- or fits with Apartments.com. Apartments.com, Homes.com, Homes.com, Apartments.com, there's some serious marketing in their heels. I'm very pleased to report that LoopNet is crossing the $200 million revenue run rate milestone right now and continues to enjoy robust traffic growth with 34% quarter-over-quarter growth in unique visitors to the site.  The site reached a record 10 million unique monthly visitors in March. LoopNet sales continue to show strength in an adverse commercial real estate market in the first quarter, with revenue growing 14% over Q1 2020. The year-over-year growth number was negatively impacted by the depressed subscription sales for LoopNet last year during the chaos of the first couple of months of the pandemic. However, during the first quarter of 2021, we saw significant growth in our higher-tier advertising solutions, with Diamond, Platinum and Gold ads growing 50% over the same period a year ago. Demand for prominent placement with these higher-tier ads on LoopNet is strong as average listing prices for these ads grew to $984 a month average in Q1 2021, up from just $710 a month Q1 2020.  Year-over-year revenue growth for our high-volume, lower-tier Silver ads was only 6%, which is how we like to manage volume ads to avoid saturation and internal competition with CoStar. We ended the quarter on a strong note in the month of March with our third-highest monthly net bookings result. Pandemic restrictions this past year have made it difficult to effectively onboard and train additional sales resources to sell LoopNet. If you have any children learning from home during the pandemic, you know what I mean, and you can appreciate how ineffective Zoom-based school can be. Fortunately, with the ability to return to the office and travel, we plan to start adding sales resources later this quarter to accelerate LoopNet's growth further. Even before that, we were still able to achieve an outstanding sales result in March by cross-commissioning and incentivizing our large, experienced, general commercial real estate sales force to sell LoopNet. Mark and Drew did a good job making that happen. We are seeing more and more of these sales professionals put up impressive sales results in both LoopNet and CoStar simultaneously. We continue to make significant enhancements to LoopNet's e-commerce sales channel. The e-commerce LoopNet sales contribution is growing and increased 24% Q1 '21 over Q1 '20. With the pandemic's negative impact on commercial office leasing, the availability rate for office space has jumped 400 basis points over the pre-pandemic availability rate. The availability rate as a percentage of office space being actively marketed for lease is the highest level we've ever recorded. We believe that makes LoopNet's reach to millions of tenants searching for commercial real estate more valuable than ever to owners who need to find tenants to fill their vacancies. It couldn't be more important. As such, we're maintaining our plans for increased investments in marketing LoopNet to owners, brokers, investors and tenants. The "Are you in the Loop?" campaign we ran from February through March this year targeted brokers and owners in an effort to elevate the LoopNet brand to top of their mind. That campaign generated 58 million impressions of high-impact creative across a variety of direct media partners, social media channels as well as programmatic video and display partners. The initial campaign served as a teaser to our broader $20 million campaign launching this May called Space for Dreams, which targets tenants and reinforces LoopNet as the most popular place to find a space. We're working with this on RPA, the agency we used to produce the excellent Apartments.com work, to produce this upcoming campaign. They have tapped Niall O'Brien as director, an accomplished director and fine arts photographer, who captures the pride of ownership inherent within buildings and showcases the breadth of buildings on the LoopNet marketplace. Niall has the ability to capture buildings in their best moment and bring the design intent of the architects to life. He creates an excitement around the properties and the opportunity they represent. The intention of this campaign ranked through the rest of the year across broad-based media is to continue to elevate the LoopNet brand and increase brand awareness. While the campaign targets tenants, we're really actually targeting owners and brokers as a pass-through audience. We believe the striking high-end architectural imagery will resonate with owners of ultrahigh-value properties and position LoopNet as a brand-appropriate channel for high-end, high-dollar property advertising. All this so I can tell Scott that our ASP per ad is going up. We have put in place many foundational elements for LoopNet to succeed this year and in the years to come. We can clearly see the enormous scale of this opportunity. Though we're crossing a $200 million revenue run rate milestone, our penetration rate is still only a low single-digit number. There are tens of thousands of very high-value opportunities out there for us and hundreds of thousands of value opportunities overall, and we're focused on winning those opportunities and growing this business.  Ten-X delivered another solid quarter and continues to benefit from the CoStar and LoopNet driving potential buyers to Ten-X. Ten-X' unique monthly visitors rose 45% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, overall account creations increased 61% with CoStar/LoopNet source creations up over 1,000% from 330 to 3,700. Average registered bidders per property rose from 5 to 13, a 160% increase; and average live bidders per property increased from 2.5 to 4, a 68% increase. The growth in the number of bidders is key because when there are 3 or more bidders at an auction, there's an 85% probability of transacting. That's an excellent number that draws properties to our network. As a result, in March, the trade rate, the percentage of properties that came to auction and sold, hit an all-time high of 81%. These strong metrics are excellent proof points of the network effect from combining Ten-X with the CoStar platforms. During the first quarter this year, we grew our Ten-X sales teams by 39%, launched a best-in-class 6-week sales training program and lead generating training program and capitalizing on this growing momentum by launching a new national marketing campaign called Ten-X It, starring comedian Keegan-Michael Key, a great actor.  We believe this campaign will further establish Ten-X as a leading brand for online commercial real estate transactions, drive market awareness that there's no faster or more certain way to exchange commercial real estate and that Ten-X as a part of the CoStar network will become an exponentially better way for buyers and sellers and brokers to exchange commercial real estate. As the campaign says, "Why just buy it or sell it when you can Ten-X It?" The successful vaccine rollout across the U.S., combined with fiscal stimulus, high household savings rates, relaxed COVID restrictions and warmer weather, have boosted consumer sentiment and spending, helping the labor markets, retail sales, restaurants, service industries in travel. The office sector struggled in Q1, setting a record for the largest single quarter of negative net absorption. Overall leasing activity remains depressed. Many companies are still evaluating their workplace strategies, but in-person tours are restarting. I'm doing one first thing in the morning. And vaccinated workers are gradually returning to in-person environments. For multifamily, the defining trend of 2020 was weak demand in the densely populated urban centers and strength out in the suburbs. While the first quarter couldn't be described as a reversal of that trend, demand has recovered to normal levels in urban centers while staying strong in the suburbs. Record search activity at Apartments.com reflects continued strong multifamily demand. Fiscal stimulus and improving health conditions are helping the retail sector, especially the service sector tenants that have struggled with lower foot traffic over the past year. Hotel occupancies continue to improve by leisure travel and are hurt by continued weak business travel. The industrial sector continues to outperform and set new quarterly leasing volume records driven by the double-digit acceleration of e-commerce. Despite the wave of new construction in the industrial sector, vacancies there ticked down in Q1 and remained near all-time lows. The capital markets have rebounded on the back of strong portfolio trading activity and a return of large national buyers. With record levels of dry powder, investors are on the lookout for distressed opportunities, so far concentrated on hotels with expectation for distressed retail assets to follow.  We just need to make sure they Ten-X those opportunities instead of just buying them. Last March, as you know, we quickly evacuated all of our offices, and our staff moved to safely work from home. Our team did an outstanding job. And though it was difficult, they all made it work for our clients, our shareholders and one another. With safe and effective vaccines now widely available, and with the help of a number of CoStar Group organized vaccine clinics on site, more and more of our staff are now vaccinated. I believe it's the majority. Employees are now safely returning to our offices by the hundreds. While it's early days, it feels like we're moving towards a more normal and productive 3D, real, face-to-face, collaborative workplace we used to enjoy. I believe that companies with teams that are able to work together face-to-face will always outcompete remote, dispersed teams. Our offices feel like a return to a college campus after a long, long summer break. I see thrilled colleagues smiling behind their masks when they run into close colleagues they've not seen in ages. It's really quite nice to see. At this point, I'm going to hand the call over to my face-to-face, real, 3D, present, sitting right here next to me, at-work colleague, our CFO, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I'll be using my 3D voice today. So hopefully, you'll notice the difference, all of you who are listening. Last year, I used my 2D voice. But yes, I think that the last part is the best news of all of everything you talked about: going back to our offices, rolling out vaccines to protect our teams and their families and getting to welcome our friends and our team members back to our offices every day. It really is super fun. And we had a great first quarter financially. I'll call it hitting through the cycle with double-digit growth in sales bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. We included Homesnap, currently in their rookie season with CoStar, in our financial results for the first time this quarter, and they were great. And we also signed up a strategically important prospect in the online residential spaces, Homes.com.  So onto the results. Revenue in the first quarter 2021 increased 17% over the first quarter of 2020, which is above the high end of our guidance range. The organic revenue growth in the first quarter, which excludes Homesnap and Ten-X, was a strong 11% year-over-year as we've come around to 1 year after the start of the pandemic.  Going forward, we expect organic revenue growth to improve to approximately 12% to 13% for the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. CoStar Suite revenue grew 4% in the first quarter of 2021 versus first quarter 2020, at the high end of our expectations. As we begin to lap the low sales months that began in March 2020 as a result of the pandemic, we expect to see CoStar Suite revenue growth improve sequentially, CoStar Suite sales in the first quarter of 2021, along with contract renewal rates, return to pre-pandemic levels.  So this is certainly very encouraging and is a much faster recovery than what occurred in the last recession for CoStar Suite. We expect CoStar Suite revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range for the second quarter of 2021. Our outlook for the full year has improved to approximately 6%, with 7% to 8% growth rates expected in the second half of the year for CoStar Suite. Revenue in Information Services grew 7% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021 to $35 million. Both the Real Estate Manager and STR turned in strong double-digit subscription revenue growth in the first quarter with Real Estate Manager subscription revenue up 19% and STR subscription revenue up 15% compared to the first quarter of 2020.  The strong subscription revenue growth was moderated somewhat by that drop in transaction revenue, which is the onetime revenue in STR that dropped, which occurred in the first part of the pandemic, in the first quarter of last year. Overall, we expect revenue growth for Information Services to improve sequentially to a rate of 12% to 14% in the second quarter of 2021, and we continue to expect growth of 10% to 12% for the full year. Multifamily revenue growth for the first quarter remained strong at 21% compared to the first quarter of 2020, which is at the high end of our expectations. The number of properties advertising with us was up 10% in the first quarter, with growth in the average rate per property also up around 10% as properties continue to upgrade their advertising packages and increase our exposure. The mid-market revenue growth rate was up over 35% in the first quarter, as Andy mentioned, with growth balanced pretty evenly between the growth in number of paying properties and growth in the revenue per property. We expect revenue for multifamily to grow at the rate of approximately 18% to 19% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020. Commercial property and land revenue grew 48% year-over-year in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. This includes the impact of the Ten-X and Homesnap acquisitions. Organic growth was 11% year-over-year in the first quarter. We expect the reported commercial property and land revenue growth rate to be approximately 55% to 60% for the second quarter of 2021. Organically, we expect growth of approximately 18% to 20% for the second quarter with improved growth across all of the marketplaces in the sector as we lap the initial pandemic impact from last year. Within commercial property and land, LoopNet revenue showed solid growth in the first quarter, increasing 14% compared to the first quarter of 2020, just a touch below our expected range of 15% to 16%.  But it's been difficult to effectively onboard and train additional sales resources to sell LoopNet during the pandemic, as Andy referenced. We expect LoopNet revenue growth to improve sequentially and grow approximately 19% to 20% in the second quarter. Our gross margin came in at 81% in the first quarter of 2021, in line with our expectations, and we expect gross margins to continue at that level in the second quarter with gradual improvement throughout the end of the year. Our profitability was strong in the first quarter with net income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS results all ahead of the guidance we issued in February.  Net income was $74 million in the first quarter with an effective tax rate of 20% for this quarter. The first quarter effective tax rate was higher this year compared to the first quarter of last year, and that's due to fluctuations in the amount and the timing of share-based payment deductions. Those wacky share-based payment deductions, you just don't know what they're going to do. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $160 million, up 29% from the first quarter of last year, and came in approximately $15 million above the high end of our guidance range. The improved adjusted EBITDA was primarily the result of higher revenue, lower personnel expenses and timing variances in the number of operating expense categories across the P&L.  The operating expense favorability is primarily timing, and we expect to incur some of those expenses later in the year. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 35% in the first quarter was 320 basis points above the first quarter of last year. Now we'll talk about some of the performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of first quarter, our sales force totaled approximately 835 people, which is lower than the sales force number reported at the end of 2020 by approximately 65. Part of this reduction is actually a modification of how we count direct sales. So a little bit of a restatement, if you would.  We moved approximately 25 positions out of the sales count in the first quarter, positions that are focused on account management or managerial responsibilities that don't really directly impact sales. So the remaining decline in sales head count sequentially of around 40 people is from first quarter attrition in the CoStar and LoopNet sales teams primarily which, from a timing perspective, was not replaced in the first quarter given the difficulty of hiring and training new sales resources while we work remotely. We expect to not only replace but to increase the size of both the CoStar and LoopNet sales teams this year.  The renewal rate on annual contracts for the first quarter of 2021 was 90%, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2020. And the renewal rate for the quarter for customers who've been subscribers for 5 years or longer was 96%, a slight improvement from the renewal rate of 95% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 78% of our revenue in the first quarter, which was in line with the last quarter. Before I talk about the second quarter and our revised outlook, let me say a few comments about the pending Homes.com acquisition, which we have not included in our outlook for 2021. Today, Homes.com generates approximately $10 million in revenue per quarter, and it's not profitable. Subject to the deal closing, which we expect to happen by the end of the second quarter this year, we intend to evaluate existing product revenues and discontinue certain services that are inconsistent with our strategy. As we wind down these services and record typical acquisition accounting adjustments, we expect to record approximately $5 million to $10 million in revenue for Homes.com in the second half of this year. We're too early in the process to providing specific guidance on the profit impact to our business. But at a high level, I would expect the transaction to be just modestly dilutive to earnings in the second half of the year as we work through integration. I'll now talk through our outlook for the full year and the second quarter of 2021. We expect full year revenue in the range of $1.930 billion to $1.945 billion for 2021, which implies an annual growth rate of 17% at the midpoint for the year. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of the Homesnap and Ten-X acquisitions, we expect growth of approximately 12% to 13% for the full year 2021. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in a range of $465 million to $470 million, representing revenue growth of 18% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. For the full year 2021, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA to a range of $645 million to $655 million, which implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $130 million to $135 million in the second quarter of 2021 for an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 28% and 29%. Our marketing campaigns for Apartments.com, LoopNet and Ten-X all accelerate in the second quarter, which results in the lower sequential margins, which isn't the case in most years. Our marketing spend in the third quarter is expected to remain at or near second quarter levels before dropping back down into the fourth quarter. So overall, it was a great start to the year. And even better, I'm fully vaccinated, Andy is fully vaccinated. We're very excited to see 3D people here in our office. But Bill here, he's still in 2D. We're going to call him flat Billy. All right, Billy, back to you. We're going to let you open it up for questions from the flat analysts on the call.
Bill Warmington: Well, thank you very much, Scott. [Operator Instructions] Gabriel, would you please assemble the questioners for the queue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities.
Andrew Jeffrey: I guess I'm going to have to accept being 2D for now. Andy, residential, obviously, has grabbed a lot of attention, right, just last quarter or 2, what was CoreLogic and all. Could you elaborate, I guess, a little bit beyond the relatively small deals you've done, albeit important, in terms of how you intend to build that out? Do you need to buy data? Do you need to buy a database? Are you going to build the database? Just trying to think about how you get from Point A to Point B in that big TAM.
Andy Florance: Yes. So we already have -- Homesnap already gives us a very solid seat at the table. It connects us with hundreds of thousands of important players, also leaders in the industry who can set up the access we need. We already subscribe to a wide array of residential information sources, but we think we can work with Homesnap and Homes and put together a very interesting strategy. And we think we'll get a lot of support from market participants for that strategy. So the first-generation models operate at scale for an extended period of time, and they never really ever produce any meaningful profits. We think there's the ability to actually build a much more profitable, lower-risk models by adopting a different business model, not trying to take the agent fees but actually facilitating the power of the Internet, the reach of the Internet, to find buyers with greater certainty and greater speed.  So we're going to develop that plan a bit over the months to come. We're beginning to do retreats around that and build out that business plan, and we'll be rolling that out later in the year. I'm -- there's not a specific additional company we need to buy today to execute that strategy. I'm sure that things will come up that will help and support our strategy. We are -- I think we're comfortable with what we're doing without any involvement from the CoreLogic acquisition. And I don't want you to worry that if that deal were on the table, the CoreLogic shareholders will be getting $101, we're not reinstituting that. There's nothing happening there. We're happy with the strategy we have with a very affordable Homes.com.  So we did overpay for it, Rusty, as a joke, that's just to the guy, the seller. We're negotiating with them all-time, he's tough to negotiate with.
Operator: And your next question will come from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: Andy, you outlined a lot of growth initiatives in your prepared remarks. And I guess what I need to better understand, or help me better understand, how do each of those ramp in the timing because it seems like there's a lot of opportunity where I think investors are going to wonder are you going to accelerate that organic growth and to what extent and over what time frame?
Andy Florance: Yes. So a lot of the stuff is somewhat dependent. I know you have kids, some of them probably are -- been homeschooling for a while, not as effective as actual in-person schooling, especially not when you're starting a new school. It's been hard to build sales forces effectively during this whole thing. And as we start to get back to a little bit more normal, I'm very much looking forward to being able to effectively build some of the sales forces. So the opportunity to accelerate growth in Apartments has been there. We've got the marketing engine that's just cranking. We have the opportunity at the middle and lower end that's really proving effective. And just it needs some more sales resources behind it. The LoopNet product is proving effective, and it needs -- just needs -- it can accelerate growth with more resources. It's already accelerating growth, but it can accelerate more with some more sales resources. I'm very excited about this sort of centralized, advanced virtual selling opportunities, of what we can do with technology and so on and so forth. I think that's going to be pretty cool. The CMBS launch is out there. The global launch is going to start hitting next quarter, meaningfully next quarter. The apartment launch is out there -- I mean the hospitality launch is out there. Ten-X is also -- we nailed the demand side. We're seeing what we want to see there. We're getting those 13 registered bidders up from 5 -- or 4 or 5 whatever it was. We're getting the flow there. And now we need to just bring more supply. That's where more revenue comes from. We've begun to train the researchers on generating those leads, and we've got an excellent training program in place. And we're going to build out the sales force there, which should bring an acceleration to that one. So it's all sort of coming together here as we come to the middle of the year. And I love Pfizer. I love Moderna. I love J&J. Just getting back to actually growing the teams to support this effort. So Scott, is there anything that's like I'm missing in terms of when these -- I mean I think that the one thing that is not this year is CoStar Lender. Excellent product there, excellent product potential, great product team there. [John McKaron] is running that group. That will be a great product. In the script, it said fourth quarter of 2021. I bumped it to first quarter of 2022. It's a complicated product, but it's pretty cool. I think it will be very compelling. So that one is more of a 2022.
Operator: Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: CoStar Suite had its best sales quarter since 2019, and that was helped by new product enhancements. Can you talk about what the sales strength reflects in terms of whether it's new institutional customers that are being brought on versus penetration among brokers versus increases in pricing that's coming back?
Andy Florance: Yes. So there's -- I don't believe there's any material impact of pricing increases. There are no pricing increases occurring right now. Going forward, later into the year, I think there will be -- not price increases, but there will be average purchasing amount increases. So people, I believe, will step up from 1 module to 3 modules as they go to the global suite. So that's effectively more revenue per customer. But so far, what it is, is higher renewal rates. People aren't -- the cancellation rate coming down has a big impact as people feel more secure about their businesses, and they see a light at the end of the tunnel. And then it is I think more seats from some existing institutional owner players. The CMBS data is now really valuable in our product. The STR data is extremely popular with anybody who is doing work in hospitality. Our rationale for acquiring STR was -- we can see it was a great product valued by the actual operators of hospitality, investors in hospitality. But we could see that STR did not have a distribution channel into those people appraising and brokering hotel sales and developing hotels and we could bring their product to market quickly. And that's been a big benefit to us, bringing the STR data in there. Would you want to add anything to that?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. I think, George, when you look at the stats on CoStar usage right now, as far as subscriber numbers, this is the first quarter we went over 160,000 subscribers. So certainly, after the dip in the second quarter last year, it's been coming back well. And as Andy said, clients are adding seats and adding users, particularly to take advantage of some of the new information. When you look at the number of sites that are using CoStar, that's also at a high level now that we hadn't hit before, over 38,000, 171 sites, it's right up at the top of where we've been. And then when you look at the number of new subscribing firms coming on, this quarter was as big as it was right after we did Xceligent, that was in bankruptcy. So like the second quarter of 2018 after that first peak, we had some pretty high levels, but now we're adding again at those levels at average contract sizes that are probably 30% higher than what they were back then. So you just kind of look at whether it's sites, whether it's subscribers or whether it's users, all of them are rising across these different customer sets.
Operator: Our next question will come from Pete Christiansen of Citi.
Pete Christiansen: Really nice trends here. Andy, I really appreciated the Homes.com-Apartments.com comparison. I thought that was pretty interesting.But certainly, looking back to that era, Apartments.com acquired a ton of marketing investment, and I think it was $150 million in its first year. Should we expect that type of aggressiveness in scaling Homes.com at some point?
Andy Florance: We are not at a place today where we have any sort of specific plan of that nature. There's nothing on Scott Wheeler's desk that analyzes those sorts of investments. We obviously are exploring the broad opportunity. I'll tell you that looking at the residential opportunity for me feels an awful lot like rinse and repeat. We've got a bunch of these information back-ends that support the front-end marketplace in real estate, and we've been doing this for a number of years. And as LoopNet crosses over $200 million, as Apartments becomes the biggest segment of our business, it is sort of like what we've been doing for a while here. And as you do, do that, you do make investments in marketing. So right now, if you're watching Squawk Box, you might see a Ten-X ad. Shortly thereafter, you see a LoopNet ad. That evening, after you switch over to Peacock, you might see Apartments.com.  I think that's part of our formula. And you do usually invest in the marketing -- you do invest in the marketing ahead of revenue. So as we go after an opportunity, which I believe could generate, over time, billions of dollars of incremental additional EBITDA, it does take our shareholders' capital to open up that wonderful opportunity.  So it's possible we might use the weapons our shareholders have given us someday. But we'll -- it's a multiyear effort. And the first component is generally software, which doesn't really show up as anything terribly visible to the analysts or shareholders.
Operator: And your next question will come from David Chu of Bank of America.
David Chu: So you mentioned that signature ads were up about 50% in the quarter. I think that was about similar to 2020. So do you expect the new marketing campaign and the step-up in the sales force to accelerate growth this year? Just wondering, besides the marketing campaign and the sales force additions, what are the other key levers to accelerate this?
Andy Florance: Yes. So we do expect that LoopNet year-over-year sales number to start moving around the 20% zone again pretty quickly. And if we're more successful with adding salespeople that know how to do it, and if the trend with the existing large CRE sales force, they keep on selling both CoStar and LoopNet, yes, we'll get some good acceleration. I think that we are getting real buy-in from the high-end folks. They used to view LoopNet as being something where people predominantly marketed lower-end properties, suburban properties, industrial properties for sale. These marketing campaigns really don't leave those smaller apartments behind but really sort of focus on branding super high-end, $1 billion properties. And I think that will open up a lot of opportunities at the high end, which is really where we're trying to go because if I take our high-target prospects, 50-some thousand high-target prospects who are multi-thousand a month opportunities, we're only 3.8% penetrated into that segment. And moving that number up to 20% on some sales-first growth and some -- and marketing that talks to that audience, I think, would have a huge impact on revenue acceleration. So we have a winner, it's just sort of tuning the different components.
Operator: Your next question will come from Mayank Tandon of Needham & Co.
Mayank Tandon: A question to margins. Given the investment priorities and the growth initiatives, what are some of the levers you have to increase margins and get that 40% targeted goal by 2023 and how you're taking change in terms of that target and how you even get there, given the change in the cost structure in the midst of the pandemic?
Andy Florance: Yes. So as we go forward to 2023, we've got organic growth coming back up, primarily with CoStar hitting its low quarter first quarter and then rising the rest of the year. So organic revenue growth would increase. We'll continue to add revenue in modest places as we have with acquisitions. And then our cost profile right now is pretty well a decision -- an investment decision profile every year. So we can still grow our cost 8%, 10% or a little more percent over the next couple of years, and that revenue growth will just bring that margin up. So it's all about the fixed cost leverage, maintaining that organic and increasing that organic revenue growth, which is the investments we put in place over the last year and then in this year that are creating these opportunities, so we've got the right fuel in there to get that revenue growth up, and then as a matter of monitoring that cost growth, again, between the 8% to 12% range over the next couple of years, and we'll hit that 40% so -- which is nice, we've been able to increase this year big ad campaigns for Ten-X and LoopNet.  Last year we did it for Apartments. But still, even with big increases in marketing every year, we can still grow our margins. So the scale of the business and the leverage profile of the business now is really helping us do things that in the current or future environment -- years ago would be scary and take a lot of our profit. Now they don't they don't impact it nearly as much, and it gives us a lot of firepower in all these sectors we're in.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ryan Tomasello of KBW.
Ryan Tomasello: Just in terms of M&A, it's hard to ignore the cash balance and the balance sheet. So you said publicly recently that you intend to focus on acquisitions in areas which CoStar does not directly compete meaningfully today. And it's clear that residential is going to be a part of that playbook. But maybe you can elaborate on other areas of the business that you see as potentially being synergistic with the broader CoStar portfolio. For example, I believe, in the past, you've referenced areas like workflow and facilities management software as examples.
Andy Florance: Sure. So I guess we are 3 deals into this year, roughly. Yes, so we've done 3. And I anticipate we'll continue to -- like, we are constantly evaluating deals that are out there. And they do come from a range of different sectors. Facilities, sure, that's a zone we look at. We're looking at a range of different things in residential. Most of them are domestic. And ForRent was a small exception to that. And these things are generally sort of tough-to-discuss specifics before they happen. And lately, they've been relatively smaller deals. So there are things out there that were kind of -- like, we're probably talking about 20 deals at any given moment.  There are 20 things on the radar screen in any given moment. But just the last couple we've done have been small. There was one you may have noticed that was potentially massive. But we're resetting and focusing on a lot of opportunities. So there's zero chance that CoStar won't continue what it's done consistently for 30 years. And they'll be similar to what we've done before, which is closely related to what we're already doing but generally, strategically, additive to some broader theme we're trying to pursue. And as you go into residential, that's a pretty big theme with a lot of opportunities. I have to tell you that the flow of deals is absurd at this point. I think I probably have 3 of my LinkedIn a day. So -- but it's more of the same, more measured, continued flow there. Do you want to add anything to that or not really?
Scott Wheeler: As you say, the residential pipeline has thrown everything at us right now. We still see things coming in the apartment sector quite frequently and commercial real estate and small information plays. There will still be others internationally that are coming at us. So all the things we've talked about before are still very active. But residential has just added another dimension and higher volumes, a lot to sift through.
Operator: Your next question will come from Mario Cortellacci of Jefferies.
Mario Cortellacci: So I wanted to talk about the new salespeople you're adding. And maybe you can just talk about the timing to productivity for these new salespeople. You're building out the middle market team, the LoopNet team, Ten-X. I mean we've heard other companies within the information services space talk about, say, a 3-year time line. And so they hit their max productivity. Do you guys have an idea of what that looks like for these new hires? And then also, because of what we're seeing in the labor market with the government support and stimulus, there's been commentary from a lot of other companies saying that it's been hard to hire, basically competing against the government. Is that a concern of yours at all? And does that create any type of wage inflation or an increased labor expense or comp expense for you?
Andy Florance: Yes. Well, your observation on competition with the government for employees is accurate. That tends to be a little bit more in the restaurant industry and some of the service industries where, yes, I hear about folks who can't hire because they earn more working for -- not working for the government. But whatever. There's definitely -- so in terms of hiring, I am definitely focused on particular -- I'm focused on the centralized sales effort. We have a great field sales team with Apartments. We have a great field sales team with CoStar, the CRE team there. For the Ten-X effort and for the mid-market Apartments effort and for the LoopNet effort, I am looking at a centralized effort. I have been able to recruit some very experienced trainers and leaders to Richmond where we think that we have the ability to compete aggressively for talent there. And our training -- we're investing a little bit more in our training programs than ever before. So we are looking at 6- and 12-week training programs but with a -- expecting a much higher success rate of deployment. On LoopNet, we believe that people can get onboard and start selling within 3 months. With Ten-X, it might be 6 months. With Apartments, we think it's 3 months. And then in terms of peak efficiency, they probably start to get up to -- I think that LoopNet, Apartments, probably, we would expect them to climb up at about 18 months to sort of full production level, and Ten-X might be 24 months. But if we can get them onboard in the first 3 to 6 months, we have a good idea of what that ROI looks like for those salespeople. And it's strong. And the situation we have here is this is a -- we have the prospects in our database. We know what their economic need for marketing is. There are many, many, many of them. There are more of them than we can reach with the existing team we have. So we have the benefit of -- and there's not a lot of competition for what we're selling. So our offering is highly differentiated. Our intelligence on who to sell to is excellent. And so yes, I think that answers that. But I would -- I do look forward to the time when there's less competition from the government for the sales force.
Operator: Your next question will come from Stephen Sheldon of William Blair.
Stephen Sheldon: On the CoStar Suite, the global platform, I guess, what percentage of your CoStar Suite subscriber base do you think could be interested in this? And what could the revenue uplift potentially look like over the next years if you're able to drive meaningful adoption?
Andy Florance: Yes. So there's two things happening there -- there's 3 things happening there. One is, for the first time, really focusing on module upsell. So someone buying just information on the properties, getting the tenant the comps and more functionality overall for the city they're already operating in. That is thousands and thousands of upsell opportunities. The next one is someone operating, getting the data -- the most common thing is someone just getting the data for the city they operate in. At this point, the way commercial real estate works, that's kind of silly because 30%, 40% of your clients are coming in from out of town, you really should know what they're doing outside your market. That one is pretty straightforward. Going up to -- when you go to global, that's going to move more into private equity firms, institutions and investors who are cross-border.  So if I'm looking at a New York or London, if I look at institutional properties, 50% plus of the capital for those bigger and higher-end properties crossing borders, we think we'll be able to offer that group a unique offering. So it's like from the small all the way up to the gigantic. And I think it also is something -- so it's hundreds of millions of potential revenue. But it's also a transformational positioning of CoStar Group where, today, if I am a commercial real estate professional in London or Toronto or Madrid, I sort of look at these -- our current solutions as being a London solution. I might even -- yes, a London solution as opposed to even a U.K. solution.  I'm just used to thinking of it as how we service our local needs. I don't think it will be that hard for us to build out a fairly robust pan-European product. And I think that pan-European product will change the game as to how people view our product in -- at the local level. And I think that will be pretty powerful. If I think about if I go back 10 years, 20 years and I think about how -- 20 years ago, how people viewed CoStar when we were really just servicing a handful of U.S. cities, our value proposition might have been a 50 on a scale of 100. Once we were serving all the major U.S. markets, we went to 100. There was an exponential value growth to the consumer, the professional, to user, when we covered their entire investment footprint, which is generally multinational.  So we're focusing heavily on investment sales tools, selling tools, comparable sales tools, news on international. And I think that will change the way we're viewed and how we're positioned. So I don't know if I answered your question at all, but I threw out a random stream of consciousness on international and suite upsell. It's exciting. It's pretty cool.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jeff Meuler of Baird.
Jeff Meuler: It sounds like a lot of the consolidated net bookings growth was in Suite. I caught a lot of metrics on Apartments' traffic and lead quality and revenue, but I don't think I caught Apartments' net bookings trends, so would love some detail on that or, if not, maybe just a random stream of consciousness on something else.
Andy Florance: Do you want to do a random stream of consciousness?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, it's my turn. Yes, we didn't talk specifically about Apartments' sales. But I mean you can do the math on our total sales numbers and kind of assume if CoStar goes up quite a bit, we're going to have like other sectors that will come down a bit. LoopNet stayed strong. Information Services stayed strong. And I'll say the volatility in Apartments is within the range of volatility it does every quarter. So it happened to be down a bit this quarter. But if you look back over the last 10 quarters of Apartments sales, which appreciate, Jeff, we don't give these numbers because of this fact, because they are volatile, Apartments net bookings move up and down, on an average, $5 million between each quarter. So you'll see this kind of up and down in the pattern. But over time, the growth obviously is there because we're still pushing the thing at 20% revenue growth. So we had such good quarters mid- to late 2020 in Apartments. I think property owners have used a lot of budget then. They trimmed them back a little bit in the first quarter, waiting for the second quarter season mostly, and then seeing where they're going to be positioned when we come back to these moratoriums, the eviction moratoriums. So you saw a little hesitancy, I think, in property owners in the first quarter, which moderated the Apartments side a bit. But CoStar picked up the slack.
Andy Florance: And to be clear, Apartments.com is rocking. Like, January is not the most exciting time for renting apartments out there, never has been. Historically, it was probably -- before we owned Apartments.com, it was a period in which the revenue actually fell very often. But the eviction moratorium is also a wet blanket, so we anticipate there'll be much more enthusiasm coming into the spring and summer. And again, I think the marketing campaign we've got going right now, when we're the only ones really doing it, is just super strong. So -- and then spiring up the mid-market. So the fluctuation Scott talks about is there and goes up, goes down. But overall, it goes up, up, up.
Operator: We have the last question from Joe Goodwin of JMP Securities.
Joe Goodwin: On the payments -- the rental payments that are occurring through Apartments.com, can you just talk about the economics that CoStar gets from those payments? And then is that a -- will that develop into a larger opportunity? Is that more just the tool set that you're offering to these folks?
Andy Florance: Yes. I'll let -- do you want to hit -- it's just like a credit card we're getting.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, we get a few small percentages off of the cards. We don't get anything else to ACH-type payments. So you get a little bit of margin off of the payment tools. And it keeps people on the platform month-to-month, which is what's really important when they filled up their units. It's not intended to be a primary revenue driver for us but one of the tools that drive the advertising and the other services.
Andy Florance: As it gets up into tens of billions or to $100 billion, it would become much more meaningful. We do offer an ACH acceleration that has a fee on it, too, but that's -- only a portion of the audience takes that. The real value there for us by a mile, the real value for us is these folks, the owners who are liking our applications and our payment and our renewal tools tend to open up their wallet to purchase a $200, $300 online ad to get higher up in the presentation. And that tends to dwarf the credit card earning sort of ACH acceleration fee, so that revenue potential of them buying the overall bundle of all the services we offer. The independent owner is a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity at higher margins. So that's where we're focused. Not to dismiss the revenue potential of that significant growing payment, but we're really trying to get the membership, the overall membership in our platform going. And also feeds, content, so the more participation we get in the marketplace, the more robust that marketplace is, which brings more renters in, which brings more advertisers in. So it's part of the whole cycle. We've long ago felt we needed to provide a broad range of services to that independent owner, which does not have the scale to really serve -- to really do it in-house or implement things in-house.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.
Andy Florance: Well, we appreciate you joining us for this first quarter 2021 earnings call, and we look forward to updating you on our progress. We obviously have a lot of stuff going on. And I think we may be appearing optimistic, and that is how we are. So thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the CoStar Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2020 Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today Mr. Bill Warmington. Please go ahead, sir.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Angela. Good evening and thank you all for joining us to discuss the fourth quarter and year end 2020 results of the CoStar Group. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder and Scott Wheeler, our CFO. I would like to review our safe harbor statement. Certain portions of the discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook and expectations for the first quarter and full year 2021. Forward-looking statements involve many risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar's press release issued earlier today and in our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are shown in detail in our press release issued today along with definitions for those terms. The press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com under Press Room. As a reminder, today's conference call is being webcast and the link is also available on our website under Investors. Please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call. And with that, I would like to turn over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Well done, Bill. You really did that preamble beautifully. I'm reflecting that in your career you've probably listened to easily 10,000 earning call and now you're actually reading the preamble. So hang in this. This is a big day for you. Okay, well. Good evening and thank you for joining us today for CoStar Group's fourth quarter and full year 2020's earnings call. And I just assume all of you are as excited as I am to be here tonight, so welcome. Total revenues for the full year 2020 were $1.66 billion, which is a 19% year-over-year growth and $9 million ahead of the top end of our guidance range given in late October. Quarterly sales booking were a solid $49 million with second half bookings rebounding 24% versus the first half of 2020. Our profit performance was equally strong delivering full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA to $553 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year and $23 million above the high end of our guidance given in October. What I believe is even more impressive despite the severe disruption of our customers and our teams caused by the pandemic in March, is that our financial results are either in line with or exceed the initial full year guidance forecast we've provided in February of last year. CoStar Group is absolutely a resilient business. In addition to the strong financial performance of our businesses in 2020, over the course of the year we've raised $1.7 billion in equity and launched our initial $1 billion bond offering with an investment grade credit rating. Our marketplace businesses particularly Apartments.com network hit record highs across all of our metrics. We've also closed three important acquisitions in 2020, Ten-X, Emporis, and Homesnap. Ten-X positions us with nearly perfectly countercyclical business and an opportunity to leverage digital marketplaces into greater commercial real estate liquidity. Emporis extends our reach with content on hundreds of thousands of properties around the world. With the addition of Homesnap in December, we expand our addressable market beyond commercial real estate into residential. Overall 2020 was clearly a transformative year and as we look ahead to 2021, our strong balance sheet and acquisition track record position us to successfully pursue multiple large growth opportunities through organic investment and M&A. before we get further into our results, I want to briefly address where we stand with our recently announced offer to acquire CoreLogic. One week ago today we delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of CoreLogic setting forth the terms of a superior proposal to acquire CoreLogic. Under the terms of the proposal CoreLogic shareholders would receive 0.1019 shares of CoStar Group common stock in exchange for each share of CoreLogic common stock, representing a value of approximately $95.76 per share based on CoStar Group's closing share price on February 12, 2021. And as I describe the CoreLogic offer I'll be using that closing share price and all the share prices relative to that day. The CoStar proposal implies pro forma diluted ownership of approximately 16.2% in the combined entity, for current CoreLogic stockholders. CoStar Group offers clearly superior to offer to the CoreLogic shareholders in immediate value. Our all-stock merger with CoreLogic improves the value of their pending transaction with Stone Point by 20% base of the date of the offer. More importantly, we believe that with hundreds of millions of dollars of identified synergies which I'll discuss in a bit more detail. The implied ownership of our proposal provides substantial value upside which we believe would deliver value in excess of $105 per share to CoreLogic's stockholders overtime. CoStar's Group stock is a solid currency and has performed exceptionally well through the decades driven by solid fundamentals such as our compound annual revenue growth of 21% over the past 20 years similarly 21% over the last 10 years and 19% over the last five years. With consistent growth and a huge addressable market CoStar Group share price is appreciated 496% in the past five years, 1,491% over the past 10 years, 3,640% over the past 20 years and 10,342% since our IPO. CoStar stock has consistently proven equally as value as cash. In addition to our all-stock offer. We plan to invest approximately $2 billion to pay down CoreLogic's existing debt and another $500 million to $1 billion to unlock the value of the company's assets. We believe the combination will create long-term growth opportunities that will help support double-digit revenue growth for the combined company for many years to come. This combination would triple CoStar Group's total addressable market by combining the global leader in digitizing commercial property with a global leader in digitizing residential real estate. We estimate that globally commercial properties have an aggregate value of $66 trillion and residential properties have an aggregate value of $114 trillion. Combined these companies will very well positioned for growth, meeting the information analysis and marketing needs of the $180 trillion global real estate industry. The global value of real estate is twice the value of all public companies combined. We believe that we can significantly accelerate CoreLogic's organic growth rate. CoStar Group has a well-established track record of acquiring slow growth companies constrained with single-digit organic growth rates and have managed them to become fast growth companies with double-digit organic growth rates. In the three years prior to CoStar Group acquiring LoopNet, revenues on average were negative 2.3% a year. In the past two years, LoopNet has grown almost 20% a year and already we've grown LoopNet's revenue more than four folds since acquisition. In three years prior to acquiring Apartments.com revenue grew at 7.7% a year on average. In the past three years, Apartments.com has grown almost 30% a year on average. All ready we've grown Apartments.com's revenue by more than 6.5 times. We believe that with product enhancements, new products, more direct selling and cross selling, selling to new audiences and segments, and integrated product offerings, there is a similar opportunity to increase significantly CoreLogic's organic growth rate. CoStar Group is the perfect strategic partner for CoreLogic and together we can drive transformative innovation. CoStar Group provides commercial real estate solutions and CoreLogic provides distinct residential real estate solutions to brokerage firms and real estate agents, banks, lenders, local, state, and federal agencies, property owners, developers, investors, appraisers, and firms selling solutions to the people and companies that use real estate. A very large percentage of these organizations have an interest in both residential and commercial, but today have to purchase different solutions from CoStar Group and CoreLogic to meet their complete real estate needs. Using disparate point solutions is inconvenient and reduces the value of the respective offerings. This is a strategic acquisition that will provide our combined clients with integrated solutions across all the relevant real estate sectors. The combined company expects to eliminate the artificial difference between commercial and residential real estate digital solutions. We believe that these integrated solutions will create massive cross-selling opportunities, significantly increasing product uptake, sales and hundreds of millions in revenue synergies. CoreLogic has approximately 150 professionals in its sales organization and CoStar Group has 1,060. In combination, the companies have the resources necessary to realize the potential cross-selling opportunity. We believe that many of the solutions CoStar Group so successfully offers today, which are only delivered to commercial real estate, can be extended into residential real estate. Marketplaces like Apartments.com and LoopNet are just two examples of these opportunities. Conversely, many of the products CoreLogic only offers to residential audiences today could also be offered to commercial real estate audiences. Property Tax Solutions, Appraisal Management, Symbility, Flood Data Solutions, and Building Cost Data are just a few examples of these sorts of opportunities. We believe that by leveraging existing technology assets into new segments of real estate the combined company can create additional significant new cross-selling revenue synergies. Further, we believe that we can achieve all of these synergies while significantly reducing the volatility of CoreLogic's revenue, which has historically experienced exposure to market cycles. Much of CoreLogic's revenues are reoccurring, but that's very different from subscription revenue. Reoccurring revenue is volatile, while subscription is much less so and has greater visibility which allows CFOs to sleep better at night. CoStar has a track record of acquiring businesses with seasonal or cyclical revenue variances associated with reoccurring revenue and converting these businesses to predictable and stable subscription revenue. 80% of CoStar's revenue is subscription-based, up from 67% five years ago. LoopNet, Apartments.com, ForRent and Apartment Finder were all businesses with only reoccurring revenue. In the aggregate, we have now converted the vast majority of revenue in those products to predictable subscription revenue. We sell our information services to banks for commercial loans, originations and surveillance on a subscription basis, while CoreLogic sells it on an on-demand basis or on a reoccurring revenue basis. We believe there is a clear opportunity to convert that revenue and other CoreLogic revenue into more predicable subscription revenue. Since CoStar Group and CoreLogic serve very different industry segments with cycles that are generally not correlated, combining the companies will further diversify the revenue sources and create a more stable combined revenue stream. In addition to these attractive growth and revenue synergies, there are significant cost synergies in this combination because there are probably hundreds of millions of dollars in duplicative costs. CoStar Group provides commercial real estate solution and CoreLogic provides residential solutions. And while the solutions of Costar Group and CoreLogic provide are completely different both companies invest heavily in very similar underlying technology processes that collect and create real estate information including property data, photographs, drone imagery, maps, aerials, market analytics and analytic models. The basic technology required to search for listings and display data and photos and map are the same. Where the properties are office buildings or houses for sale. CoStar Group and CoreLogic combined will have nearly 10,000 personnel software developers, researchers and photographers all collecting similarly structured, distinct but related real estate content. In combination there's vast potential to duplicate processes and achieve significant cost synergies. Considering both revenue growth and cost synergies, a combination of the existing CoStar business with CoreLogic would result in $150 million to $250 million annual run rate EBITDA synergies. These synergies alone are worth over several billions of value for our stockholders. Throughout this process, CoreLogic's advisors, our advisors, analyst reports, and major CoreLogic shareholders who have done the analysis have agreed that there is no antitrust risk in this combination. CoStar Group provides commercial property listings and analytics to commercial real estate brokers and owners and internet marketplaces for lead generation for commercial properties for lease and sale. CoreLogic, on the other hand, aggregates publicly available property tax assessment data, publicly reported sales and mortgage transactions to provide various solutions needed in residential real estate. In addition, CoreLogic provides multiple listing services the software and hosting services they need to manage residential listings. Our respective companies are in completely different markets. CoStar and CoreLogic do not compete with one another in any way. No client or prospect ever chooses between buying a CoreLogic solution versus buying a CoStar Group solution. They cannot because our products are completely different. Given the presence of multiple providers of the publicly available data CoreLogic resells, there are simply no meaningful antitrust concerns in our view. We believe that our February 16 proposal to CoreLogic will provide great value to the stockholders of both companies. We're very excited and we believe the staff of both companies are very excited to have the opportunity to unlock the amazing possibilities this potential could create. The next steps involve CoreLogic Board making a determination that CoStar's offer is the superior offer. After that StonePoint I believe will have the opportunity to improve their offer. We sincerely hope, we can move forward without delay. As I'm confident, that we could complete a deal rapidly and we expect the transaction could close within four to 12 months. At the end of this call, we look forward to taking your questions on our results that we're announcing today. But we'll not be taking any questions on CoreLogic, the offer or the possible transaction. I hope you can understand that the process we're engaged in, in this point is very sensitive an open Q&A is not appropriate at this time in the forum. Thank you for your understanding on that. Now let's get on to the rest of our earnings call. Despite all the dislocation and anguish to the pandemic. 2020 was a record year for our marketplaces and especially for Apartments.com. People need a home in a pandemic more than ever. Virtual shopping in Apartments.com provide a safer alternative to touring apartments in person. More renters than ever are looking for new apartment and more research is taking place from home. With renters taking advantage of innovative virtual search tools available in Apartments.com and our network of websites. Renters took a breathtaking 170 million virtual tours on our site in 2020, twice as many as the year before. As you're aware Apartments.com has turned in strong performance several years in a row and in 2020 we significantly increased our marketing spend to a record $221 million up 44% versus 2019. We'll not be increasing it again this year. In fact, it's down a touch. The increased spend was clearly exceptionally effective resulting in record site traffic of 1 billion network visits according to Google Analytics, a 20% year-on-year. This extraordinary milestone reflects the company's unmatched growth in investment garnering over 160 million more visits than last year strengthening our position as the nation's leading network with more visitors than all other competitors. In total, visitors to Apartments.com viewed nearly 10 billion property pages in 2020. When we look at the ComScore stats which allow us to compare against peers. The Apartments.com network had annual site traffic growth of 17% in comparison. In RentPath grew its total network site visits by 9%. I've heard others quote stronger growth but those must be internal numbers let's say because we're not able to collaborate them externally. For Apartments.com, our record traffic translated to record annual net new sales that was up 35% versus 2019 and a full year record 2020 revenue of $599 million. A gain of 22% year-on-year, and an addition of $120 million on a Q4 run rate basis. We expand the number of advertising properties by 10% year-over-year adding over 5,000 new advertisers. Clearly, all of our initiatives are paying off from our expanded sales force of the midmarket to our efforts to better serve the independent owner market. Just one year after launching our online rental tools, Apartments.com is processing nearly 18 million in monthly new rental payments and over 355 million in monthly rent in combination with our cozy platform rental payments. Which we're migrating into Apartments.com in the near future that is 5.4 billion in annual rent payments now which is a great start to build from, in the years ahead. We were disappointed that we were not able to close our proposed acquisition of RentPath. But believe our time and money was ultimately very well spent in the process. We in RentPath recognize going into the proposed acquisition that the antitrust hurdle could be significant since we were clearly competitors. In fact, the RentPath was bankrupt made the failing firm defense a possible viable path. The inflection point for us came down to our learning that the non-public rumor [ph], that a household name internet giant shared their plans to launch a marketing solution that would be more directly competitive with both us and RentPath. While the giant intended to partner with us. They would clearly provide a potential competitive alternative. We felt that in the face of giant entering the space, it will unlikely that the FTC would find that RentPath standalone represented any material or significant competitive impact. Hence, we felt that the deal was likely to clear. However during the process the giant drew significant antitrust scrutiny of their own and we have reason to believe that in conversations with the government, the giant pledge not to enter our space. As a result, three things happened. One, the giant did not enter our space which is really good news. Secondly, the antitrust analysis and acquisition of RentPath shifted out of our favor which was bad news. Third, in the FTC's opinion they say that their investigation concluded Zillow was not an effective competitor to Apartments.com which we enjoyed. So as a reward for the nearly a year we spent on RentPath, we had four of the five best selling quarters in the history of Apartments.com, sold an all-time high of 37.5 million of new sales in the second quarter of 2020 and added over 5,000 new advertisers to our platform to the year end at 57,828 and had over one-third of the properties begun the year advertising exclusively on RentPath beside to switch their marketing to Apartments.com. So I think you'll agree that all in all including with break fee, it was not such a bad outcome for the process. CoStar Suite enjoyed a strong finish to the year recovering nicely after a brief pause earlier this year when we entered the pandemic. From a low base in Q2, CoStar Suite has doubled its net new sales for the second quarter in a row demonstrating the resilience and mission critical nature of the product. A number of important CoStar products enhancements we invested in during 2020 are coming to fruition and we're just now beginning to rollout some groundbreaking new functionalities. We just launched the integration of a wealth of commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS information into CoStar. This continually updated CMBS information provides valuable insights into more than $1 trillion of outstanding commercial loans made to 100,000 commercial properties. This adds very valuable information on 90,000 to some of the largest commercial leases or tenants. It enables our customers to gain additional visibility into lease expirations and actual rental rates. Clients can use this information to attract new clients and influence their pricing or leasing decisions. The new information also prevents regularly updated detailed building operating cost statements on 40,000 large properties. This information is very valuable to investors, tenants, brokers and developers who need to understand like operating cost might be in new property or as a performance cost comparison for properties that are already owned, leased or managed. Another new important new value we now bring to our clients is new visibility into the distress in thousands of properties. This visibility gives brokers, investors and even our own Ten-X sales people insights into who maybe pushed into divesting a property soon or who may not have the ability to fund necessary tenant improvements or who might not be able to pay leasing commissions in a deal. This information is enhanced by the high frequency market data CoStar provides on new leases and vacancies that are leading indicators as to whether or not the credit on certain loans is improving or deteriorating. This newly integrated CMBS data gives our lender and mortgage banking clients great data on maturing loans who are feeling the opportunities for them to originate new loans. All this information adds additional value to our market economic analysis tools with future releases clients will be able to monitor overtime geography and property type, overall new origination trends, default trends, expense trends, rental rate trends and a lot more. I'd like to give a big shout out to John Vecchione and his team for the great work they've done here. Another 2020 development initiative has been to integrate the STR data into CoStar Suite. We've moved very quickly on that acquisition. Before I describe that, let me just say that in a year which has brought the hospitality industry to a complete standstill the performance of STR has been nothing short of miraculous. Client retention was 97% and subscription revenue in Q4 actually grew 5% year-over-year despite hotels seeing occupancy rates fall by 80% during the dark days of the first half of 2020. So again STR like the rest of CoStar Group is resilient and appears to be almost countercyclical but certainly downwardly resistant. In the first quarter of 2021, we'll be launching the hospitality data embedded into CoStar Suite which we believe will be a significant interest to the 4,000 customers at 11,000 prospects we have that are exposed to the hospital industry. Combined with CMBS tool with STR data also creates a powerful tool for distressed assets so the timing of our product launches is ideal. Our significant product enhancements included 250 new hospital specific deals such as occupancy, average daily rate in RevPAR, 90,000 new and enhanced hospitality property records; 50,000 new hotel sales comps enhanced with relevant data including brand, parent company and operator and 22,000 new architectural quality hotel photos. The most valuable aspect of this integration of unique high frequency STR fully anonymized hospitality performance benchmarking data, is the trend in market analysis value it will bring to our clients. For the first time, anywhere, ever. Our clients will be able to see aggregate hospitality performance by geography in property class through time. This daily reliable trend information occupancy and rental rates knowledge stuff is super valuable to investors, lenders and operators who need to understand the risks and opportunities in these assets classes. There will be another major STR upgrade integration to CoStar later this year that will allow our benchmarking clients to access their information in CoStar in a dramatically more powerful and valuable way. We think that our hospitality clients will value seeing their performance a much broader context of hotel inventory sales, comps, market analysis and forecast. And also the new product will have portfolio level analysis for our clients. I feel our STR team is doing some very inspired work in this area and I'm confident that our STR clients will feel that we have delivered beyond expectations and our promise to enhance the STR technology platforms. Finally an update on launch of our international product. Later this quarter, we expect to launch a new international polyglot multi-currency an imperial metric version of CoStar. We plan to open up the commercial real estate information our clients see from being domestic only to international. A client who as to now has only seen London data will now open CoStar and see news information and analytics in the US, Canada, Europe and the rest of the world. Much of institutional capital flow in commercial has stayed across border in fact the majority of it. But until now the information systems have been largely local. We think this change to our product will have a profound impact on long-term on the value we can deliver to investors, tenants and brokers that work across borders. As the pandemic travel restrictions ease in the future, we intend to initially further expand the breadth of information we provide on 15 additional European markets. The integration of global Emporis data is going very well, with 195,000 properties now loaded into CoStar Suite. The international datasets and a number of our enhanced features are only available through our CoStar Suite customers and are not available to those customers that only subscribe to our Costar comps, tenants and property modules. Over the course of the next 12 to 18 months we're going to focus intently on reaching out to thousands of firms that only subscribe to a subset of the CoStar product and upsell them to the full capabilities of the full CoStar suite product. We believe the subsell effort will be a significant revenue accelerator for CoStar. Ultimately because we can provide our clients more value move past effectively by only producing the one suite product. We intend to sunset selling the individual modules of Costar. All of these new features and future releases we're currently working on give tens of thousands of perspective CoStar clients one more reason, why they really should subscribe to CoStar. Strong Q4 performance capped to breakout year for LoopNet that demonstrates the business is growing traction in countercyclical characteristics. I believe the single most effective way to market commercial real estate today is online using LoopNet marketplace and its massive audience of millions of engaged tenants and investors. In 2020, we saw strong growth across all levels of our LoopNet advertising solutions. We have achieved strong success and high penetration with our standard advertising levels and we're increasingly focused on driving revenue by selling differentiated ads to our clients that deliver more reach, frequency and branding benefits than our standard ad levels. On average, our top level of diamond ad receives 170 times more exposure than does a standard ad. In addition, it receives nearly twice the frequency or repeat exposure of a standard listing. With our new investments in retargeting, we've identified the most engaged prospects viewing diamond ads and we on average achieve a remarkable repeat frequency with them of 172 times in a monthly basis, that's excellent marketing saturation for our clients. Our top tier ads diamonds, platinums, golds provide unrivalled benefit such as professional photo shoots, 3D virtual tours, drone photography and individualized retargeting. Revenue for our higher tier diamond, platinum and gold advertising products grew 48% from $24 million in 2019 to $36 million in 2020 and net sales bookings of higher tier advertising levels doubled. In comparison, premium listers which are bundles of silver ads the basic level, the standard level which are original advertising option grew 17% year-over-year from $120 million in 2019 to $140 million in 2020. Property owners saw increasing value in our higher tier advertising solutions with Q4 average revenue per listings up 94% from $481 to $936 per month, per ad well some of them moving into $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 a month. Overall LoopNet market place revenue grew 20% year-over-year in 4Q. Traffic showed strong with 37% year-over-year at monthly unique visitors reaching a record average of approximately 8.9 million monthly visitors. We believe that the evidence shows that we're picking up speed with our LoopNet's strategy and the total addressable market is in the billions of dollars. We can interpolate revenue results in a relative GDP basis from a similar marketplace to LoopNet's base in Australia and see clear evidence of a multi-billion TAM opportunity. The current commercial real estate market economics are also ideal for LoopNet sharply rising availabilities across almost every US market is more demand than normal for advertising solutions to generate prospects to help owners and brokers to convert their vacancies back into revenue. When we accelerated our marketing investment to Apartments.com based on its outperformance. We believe that we're able to look back and demonstrate a very attractive ROI on that investment because we believe we have a similar excellent investment opportunity to invest in LoopNet growth. We intend to significantly increase our salesforce headcount SCM investment, digital and broad-based media investments going into 2021. As we've discussed previously, we're building a dedicated LoopNet salesforce alongside our CoStar sales team. In Q4, we added 40 new dedicated LoopNet sales people. These new dedicated reps in the CoStar Suite salesforce continue to aggressively market and sell LoopNet products. To complement our investments in product and sales this year we're increasing our marketing program for LoopNet targeting all of our constituent networks, property owners, brokers, tenants and investors. We're launching our first media campaign this quarter across digital channels. This, are you in the loop campaign which launches this week is focused on evaluating the LoopNet brand to brokers, owners across digital channels specifically in larger metropolitan areas? These marketing efforts will supplement our growing salesforce by increasing both awareness and our best-in-class marketing solutions. We plan to release a broader media campaign a little bit later this spring announcing LoopNet as the place for all spaces. This campaign will be broadcast across TV and other broad based media outlets in effort to generate mainstream awareness of the LoopNet brand, by reaching tenants and investors and becoming a more colloquial brand. LoopNet plans to replicate some of the success Apartments.com has seen over the past few years. In addition, we continue to intelligently invest in search engine marketing to relevant keywords. LoopNet already enjoys a considerable advance for both organic and paid search rankings. I'm proud to say that LoopNet now ranks Number One for 125,000 relevant commercial keywords on Google. And our SCM spend is supporting that within four-fold increase in investment since 2019. We will combine investments in SCM and with retargeting programs for increased reach and frequency. LoopNet's retargeting strategy taps into our extensive database of broker, owner, investor, tenant contacts and matches them with hyper relevant property ads that matches their search criteria increasing the search to our property ads and placing our ads across the web on high quality sites including CNN, Yahoo, Bisnow etc. We also take into account unique data regarding which market tenants tend to relocate to or from to ensure we match them with properties of higher likelihood that they're going to lease into. Keep in mind these investments made in LoopNet also will benefit Ten-X given the cross pollination of traffic between those sister properties. And we view this rising tide is lifting both of these sites. Our LoopNet marketing investment in the first half of 2020 was $10 million and we expect that investment to triple to $31 million in the first half of 2021. Overall our LoopNet marketing investment is expected to be around $66 million for the year which is doubled $32 million we invested in 2020. While we're still in early stages we're excited about the progress we're seeing in LoopNet and think this is the time to increase investments in sales and marketing to help accelerate the conversion of that TAM into CoStar revenue. And we're nearing the end of my brief remarks just about 20 minutes to go. I'm very happy with the initial results we're seeing as we combine the strengths of CoStar, LoopNet and Ten-X. And Ten-X revenue grew 14% Q4, 2020 over Q4, 2019 well ahead of our expectations and Ten-X even generate a small profit in the quarter. The first time that's happened in many years. We've already made number of improvements, investments to the business since we closed the acquisition in June and as improvements are already delivering results. We're focused on driving series of improvements to both the demand side and the supply side of Ten-X. We need to drive improvement in both areas in order to drive meaningful adoption in revenue growth. Improving the demand side means improvement in the number of qualified bidders that show up at our online auction events ready to bid. Improving the supply side means increasing the number of owners bringing valuable properties to site with realistic pricing expectations. When you increase the demand side dramatically it makes it much easier to attract more sellers for the supply side. Our first efforts have therefore focused on demand side. I'm very happy with the result and more importantly I think now our clients are very happy with those results. We're leveraging the massive audience of CoStar, LoopNet and promoting the Ten-X auction properties were the most prominent advertising placements on both of these sites. These internal ads are bringing thousands of new bidders to Ten-X. Properties for auction now are visible in both CoStar and LoopNet with rolling counters appearing on the properties for auction counting down to the time of sale. In addition, we've dramatically increased our investment in Ten-X related keyword marketing on Google. We've also used our massive database of an active investment sales brokers, buyers and owners and have begun aggressively recharging [ph] with them with display advertising across the internet for specific relevant Ten-X auctioned properties. As a result, the exposure of auction properties in the Ten-X site has increased significantly with unique visitors doubling from Q3 to Q4 which is quite amazing. Our efforts and investments are paying off and we can see clear improvements in the demand side. The average number of fully approved bidders on an auction increased 153% from 4.2% in Q4, 2019 to 10.7% in Q4, 2020. The number of those watching bidders that engaged and placed a bid increase 66% from 2.2% in Q4, 2019 to 3.6% in Q4, 2020 on a per property basis. This increase in demand had the result we wanted which is the percentage of properties that came to auction and successfully sold increased 42.6% going from 43.8% in Q4, 2019 to 63% in Q4, 2020. This is so called trade rate and it's now approaching double the industry average offline trade rate. Since we're only paid when the property trades this increase in trade rate resulted in an increase in our revenue. Moving forward to 2021, we plan to continue focusing on best increasing the demand side but we'll begin to make significant investments in increasing the supply side success on both sides could have a very positive revenue growth impact. The original pricing strategy for Ten-X was just a port from the offline auction world to the online auction world. I did not think it really made a whole lot of sense to do that. But you know moving on. Dynamics now we're completely different. If NASDAQ had simply stuck with the OTC pricing model none of us would probably have ever heard of NASDAQ. Ten-X has historically charged the buyer 5% fee, on the larger properties that's more than broker's commission. Ten-X has historically offered consistent rebates and discounts which means their sticker's price could scare people off. But their effective price was much less. Looking at the gross margin for sale, there's plenty of room to reduce price with an eye to increasing volume and more than making up for the reductions and the volume of a vibrant marketplace, we believe it will create. We expect this pricing simplification will create modest near-term revenue headwind. But ultimately will increase total platform volume especially volume from first uses of platform. We're expanding the salesforce, Ten-X currently has only 25 sales and we plan to grow that number significantly in 2021. In addition, we plan to leverage our team of over 1,000 CoStar market researchers who daily contact with property owners and managers provides a great opportunity to source new properties for sale with Ten-X. We're making a very significant investment in marketing in 2021 to drive demand supply to Ten-X. We have developed a broad campaign for TV, digital media retargeting and increased SCM. The tagline these campaigns will use is, don't just sell it, Ten-X it. This tagline focuses our prospects on the fact that a property is much more likely to sell online with Ten-X than it is offline and is much likely to sell faster as well. We plan to use it battle the bid gamification campaign to drive visibility traffic contraction with a broader real estate community in 2021. Hundreds of thousands of CRE, investors, owners and brokers who will be invited to a number of Ten-X auction will be able to guess what Ten [ph] properties will ultimately sell for in the auction, the more accurate they guess, more likely to win, be lot of fun, lot of prizes, lot of money, we think lot of folks will show up and play. So we're increasing our investment in Ten-X marketing by 400% from $9 million in 2020 to potentially $36 million in 2021, a four-fold increase. We've made great process on our Ten-X integration plans in 2020 and now is the right time to accelerate our investments to be ready to take full advantage of the expected increase and distressed assets come into market. While it's difficult to quantify the amount of timing and expected increase in distressed assets. Current CMBS for closure rates are trending upwards and are now above levels seen at this stage in the last recession of 2008, 2009. Our estimates indicate potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of distressed properties will materialize over the next three to five years implying potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Ten-X. Now I'm going to skip the economy update section of my script and start moving closer to the CFO section. The challenges of 2020 highlighted the strengths of CoStar's business model. Our mission critical subscription-based products combined with discipline investments in the business enabled us deliver outstanding financial results. In 2021, we expect to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth in margin expansion while simultaneously investing very aggressively in LoopNet and Ten-X and we believe in those investments. We're going to use our strong balance sheet and successful acquisition track record to pursue multiple large growth opportunities. At this point, I'm now going to turn the call over to our distinguished but still youthful, CFO. Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you for that introduction.
Andy Florance: You're welcome.
Scott Wheeler: I'll try and display my youthful vigor as I march through my comments today. Thank you, Andy. So 2020 was a great year for CoStar both strategically and financially and personally I find it much easier to sleep at night with $3.8 billion in the bank, a negative leverage and a shiny new investment grade debt rating sitting on my nightstand. Now we certainly staged a great come back rally after the - pandemic scrambled our plans this past year and we managed to beat the original 2020 profit guidance that we gave way back in February. I think it's a great compliment to the strength of our business model, the value of our product and the execution focus of our leaders and all of our teams. Of course you throw in a few exciting acquisitions along the way and 2020 starts to feel like a typical year here in CoStar Group. As Andy mentioned in his comments, we're excited for potential opportunities to add CoreLogic to our business. But I won't be providing any financial comments nor will take any questions on this topic during the Q&A session. So onto some color on the results. So revenue here, Andy talked about was nicely in the fourth quarter margins were also improved in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA grew over the year and from the third quarter and we ended up outperforming the high end of our guidance by $23 million, which is a fantastic outcome even as we continue to invest to support our future growth which involves the marketing investments, we've made this year for Apartments.com and increased marketing that will began later in the year for LoopNet. Before I go through our sector results, you noticed that our EBITDA and our net income results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2020 include one-time cost related to the terminated RentPath purchase agreement. The proposed transaction was terminated in the fourth quarter and we recorded $59.5 million charge as part of G&A expenses. This charge includes settlement of the termination fee for $52 million as well as the cost for extension payments that we made earlier in the year. A total $59.5 million charge is removed and our adjusted EBITDA calculation as non-recurring acquisition related expenses. The approximate income our net income for the year is $44 million or $1.15 per diluted share. So onto our revenue by services, CoStar Suite grew 5% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the year which is a little bit ahead of what we projected back in October. We've seen stronger than expected sequential performance in CoStar Suite in both sales and renewal rates and we expect quarterly growth in revenue will continue. We expect CoStar Suite growth in the 5% to 6% range for the year 2021 with the first quarter representing the low point of growth at around 3% to 4% with the most significant difficult comparables to get passed for the next year. The CoStar Suite revenue growth is expected to increase sequentially throughout the year. We've not assumed any contract renewal rate increases in our outlook although we anticipate that this could occur if the economic environment strengthens in the latter part of 2021. Information services revenue grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 47% for the full year and includes the impact of STR acquisition which we closed in mid fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding STR revenue in information services in 2020 was probably in line with revenue in 2019 for both the full year and the fourth quarter. As we move past finally, the high levels of one-time implementations revenues that we're in our 2019 results for the real estate manager business. Subscription revenue growth remains in real estate manager up 11% in the fourth quarter and increasing 13% for the full year of 2020. STR results in 2020 were very encouraging as we work to integrate STR data and products into CoStar. As we all know the hospitality sector sort of took it on the chin in 2020. The hotel revenue per available room down as much as 50% in the US and up to 90% in some European markets. Nevertheless STR proved vital to the operations of our hotel customers and our revenues grew in the fourth quarter sequentially up 5% to 6% over the third quarter of the year. Retention rates on STR subscriptions remain over 95% and STR subscription revenues increased in both the third and fourth quarters of this year. A strong and a positive sign as we work towards launching the new STR products in CoStar that Andy talked about in 2021. Overall we expect double-digit revenue growth in 10% to 12% range for information services sector in 2021 starting in approximately 7% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2021 and improving as we continue throughout the year. We had another great year in the Apartments business with 23% growth in the fourth quarter and 22% revenue growth for the year, all of which is organic growth. The number of properties advertising with us increased around 10% in the fourth quarter while the average revenue per property increased by approximately 11%. Revenue per property increased as a result of customers continuing to trade up to high value ad packages as we did not raise pricing on our rate cards at all during the year. For 2021, we expect to see continued strong performance in sales and revenues for Apartments with revenue growth of approximately 20% in the first quarter and 19% to 20% for the full year. That was my 20% growth alarm, it goes off every time I get a business growing over 20% organically in a quarter. We expect 2021 revenue growth in dollar terms will exceed the dollar revenue growth in 2021 for Apartments as we continue to focus efforts on penetrating the mid and small property market sectors. The commercial property and land sector grew 51% in the fourth quarter and 31% for the full year including the impact of Ten-X acquisition. Organic growth was 15% for both the fourth quarter and the full year respectively. For 2021, we expect total revenue growth for commercial property and land in a range of 45% to 50% for both the first quarter and for the full year. Organically excluding revenue from the Ten-X and Homesnap acquisition. We expect growth of approximately 20% for the full year. LoopNet revenue growth was stronger than ever 20% for the full year of 2020 and 20% in the fourth quarter. The signature ad revenue growing 50% on a full year basis. We expect LoopNet revenue growth to continue at around 20% in 2021 with growth of around 15% to 16% in the first quarter against tougher year-over-year revenue comparisons. Revenue on our land and small business market places were essentially flat in the fourth quarter and a grew at single digits rates for the year. The small business market plays in particular was sharply impacted by the pandemic in 2020. We expect growth rates to recover in both lands and business of sale marketplaces in 2021. Both revenue increases in 8% to 10% range. Ten-X delivered a strong finish to the year with $19 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and $32 million in revenue in 2020 exceeding our initial revenue estimates and delivering positive pro forma growth year-over-year since the acquisition. Now each of the years - three years prior to acquisition of Ten-X revenue had declined by approximately $10 million per year. First one positive data point is not yet a trend but the metric so far promising for Ten-X as Andy talked about. Due to the transactional nature of the revenue in Ten-X we expect to see revenue fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending on economic conditions, historical seasonality as well as our own investment and integration initiatives. Historical seasonality for Ten-X indicates lower transaction volumes typically in the first quarter and stronger volumes in the fourth quarter. Our 2021 forecast assumes around $50 million to $55 million revenue for Ten-X with approximately 20% of net revenue in the first quarter. we've built our revised pricing rate card for Ten-X into our outlook but have not assumed material volume lift from distressed property sale or from our marketing investments in 2021, making this what I consider relatively cautious forecast until we see how the year starts to turnout for the business. Homesnap is our latest addition to the commercial property and land family having completed the acquisition in late December of 2020. We did not include any Homesnap result for the handful of days that we owned the company in 2020. Homesnap revenues are comprised of both advertising and subscription revenue. With advertising making up approximately two-thirds of the revenue. Our 2021 forecast assumes around $50 million for Homesnap with approximately $10 million of that revenue in the first quarter. Pro forma growth rate of the business is a little over 20% year-over-year in 2021. Profit contribution of Homesnap in 2021 is expected to be around negative $5 million as we continue invest for growth. We absorb both the acquisition deferred revenue adjustments which are typical in acquisitions of this type and the cost of moving the approximate 165 Homesnap employees to our CoStar compensation and benefit plan. Our gross margin was 82% in the fourth quarter and 81% for the year up two-fold percentage points from last year and four-fold percentage points from 2019. This is a great reflection of the strong leverage inherent in our subscription business model. We believe we can continue to deliver revenue growth over our underlying platforms and produce margin improvements overtime. We expect gross margin of approximately 81% for 2021 with margins early in the year around 80% as we add Homesnap to our results and improving to around 82% by the end of 2021. Net income was $36 million in the fourth quarter and $227 million for the full year which as I mentioned includes the tax affected impacted of $59.5 million of one-time charges relating to RentPath. Our effective tax rate was 23% for the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $167 million up 18% from the fourth quarter of last year and came in approximately $23 million above the high end of our guidance range. The improved adjusted EBITDA was a result of outperformance of $9 million in revenue, lower spending on personnel marketing and improvements in our bad debt level from earlier in the year which is certainly a welcome sign. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 38% in the fourth quarter was a full five percentage points of above the mid-point of our guidance range. Cash and investment balances were approximately $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and we generated almost $500 million in operating cash flow in 2020, $486 million to be exact and deploying approximately $440 million of that positive cash to buy Ten-X and Homesnap. In addition, if you've been following news in Richmond, Virginia lately which I do religiously. You'll have noticed we purchased a parcel of land adjacent to our current Richmond location in the third quarter of 2020 and we recently purchased the Richmond Building that we've occupied under sublease for $130 million in the first quarter of 2021. Both of these purchases provide a variety of expansion options for our teams in Richmond or perhaps we should become a digital commercial property flipper. I hear it's a trending new business model that is emerging these days. I'll leave that for future earnings calls. Onto the performance metric which won't include anything for Homesnap until future quarters? We achieved $49 million of net new sales in the fourth quarter rounding out a great second half recovery in sales following the pandemic disruption in the first half of the year. We saw continued solid sequential improvement in CoStar bookings and another very strong quarter in Apartments. The strength of our sales efforts along with planned investments in both sales and marketing in the coming year are expected to keep us on track for strong double-digit organic growth in our subscription businesses in 2021. Our salesforce totalled approximately 900 people at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of around 40 people from the third quarter and that's over 50 people from the fourth quarter of 2019. We continue to build out our dedicative LoopNet sales team as we discussed last quarter which accounted for most of the growth in our sales team in the fourth quarter. So for perspective at the end of 2020, our largest sales organizations are CoStar with 340 sales people, Apartments with around 320 sales people and LoopNet with 115 sales people. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 90% slightly better than the 89% in Q3. It's great to see our renewal moving back up. If you recall earlier this year there were concerns of a deeper more sustained drop in renewal rate similar to what we saw in the last recession. But it looks as though those concerns can be later [ph] to rest at least for now. In fact the fourth quarter 2020 renewal rate is essentially in line with the fourth quarter of 2019. The renewal rate in the fourth quarter for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 95% in line with the renewal rate of 95% in the third quarter of 2020. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 78% of our revenue in the fourth quarter down approximately five percentage points compared to last year. The decline is entirely due to the addition of Ten-X into the portfolio this year. If we include subscriptions on shorter duration contracts such as three, six or nine months approximately 92% of our revenue is subscription based. I'll now discuss our outlook for 2021 in the first quarter. We expect full year revenue in the range of $1.925 billion to $1.945 billion in 2021 which implies an annual growth rate of 17% in the midpoint for the year. As I mentioned previously, our outlook includes approximately $50 million for the Homesnap which we acquired at the end of 2020. On an organic basis excluding the full year impact of Homesnap and Ten-X which we acquired in mid-2020. We expect growth of approximately 12% to 13% for the full year of 2021. We anticipate organic growth rates will be lower in the first quarter in the 11% to 12% range as this is expected to be the low quarter for CoStar Suite. Throughout the year we expect organic growth rate to improve sequentially and finish the year around 14%. For the first quarter of 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $450 million to $455 million representing revenue growth of 15% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. For the full year 2021, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $640 million to $650 million which implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of a little over 33% at the midpoint of this range. Excluding both the revenue and the adjusted EBITDA of Homesnap, our adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to improve by approximately 120 basis points in 2021 to 34.5% compared to the adjusted EBITDA margins of a little over 33% than we achieved in 2020. So overall our underlying margins are improving over 100 basis points year-over-year in 2021 to little over 34% prior to the acquisition of Homesnap. We plan to increase our investment in marketing in 2021 to support the significant growth opportunities we have in both LoopNet as well as the Ten-X business. We expect total marketing cost of approximately $345 million in 2021 an increase of around $70 million of our marketing cost in 2020. The Homesnap acquisition brings along a little over $20 million of the increased marketing spend with the remaining net increase focused on LoopNet and Ten-X as Andy talked about. When you think about it, just a few years ago increased investments of this scale like the ones we expect in 2021 would have had a significant negative drag in our profitability. [Indiscernible] increasingly obviously is that with the increasing sale of the company we're now able to invest much more aggressively for future growth while at same time improving our profit margins. For example in 2021, our expense growth without accounting the recent acquisitions year-over-year into our results. It's probably around $120 million which happens to be about the same amount of marketing investments that was made back in 2015 when we launched Apartments.com. You may recall at that time, $120 million marketing investment wiped out all of the CoStar Group's profit. By contrast in 2021, we can make that same size investment and not only will it not only decrease our profit levels. But we will generate close to $100 million more adjusted EBITDA in 2021 than we did in 2020. This is a significant growth advantage as we continue to enter new market sectors. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $140 million to $145 million in the first quarter of 2021 for an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 31% and 32% and approximately $20 million compared to the first quarter of last year. In terms of the timing of adjusted EBITDA across remaining quarters of the year, we expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA slightly lower than the first quarter as our marketing expense typically increases in the second quarter. In the third quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to move back up above the first quarter level with fourth quarter increasingly significantly as the marketing spend is expected to be tail off near the end of the year. In terms of earnings, we expect full year non-GAAP net income diluted share of $10.83 to $11.03 based on 39.7 million shares. For the first quarter of 2021, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $2.33 to $2.43 based on 39.5 million shares. Now, the 2020 in the rear-view mirror. I believe we're firmly on track to achieve our long-term objectives of $3 billion in run rate revenue and 40% adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023. 2020 was certainly an amazing year for our company for CoStar Group. We ended the year with strong double-digit revenue growth both in total and organic revenue growth and despite the continuing global pandemic and uncertain economic environment. We generated over $500 million of profit and nearly the same in operating cash flow while strengthening our balance sheet with both equity and investment grade debt. The acquisitions we completed represent significant, strategic and financial growth opportunities for the company and the acquisitions we're pursuing can truly the transform the business. Thank you for supporting CoStar this year in so many ways and I look forward to updating you on our results as we navigate the year 2021. Bill, let's turn the call now back over to you. So you can issue the ground rules for today's fun and exciting question-and-answer session.
Bill Warmington: Thank you, Scott. Two items before we start the Q&A this evening. First, one question per participants, so make it an exceptionally insightful or probing one. And second, a reminder that we will not be taking any questions about our bid to acquire CoreLogic. Angela, would you please assemble the questionnaires for the queue.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] our first question is from the line of Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: So in terms of the marketing investment that you're making across the business, what gives you the comfort that now is the right time that you can actually lift the gas pedal on spending for Apartments for the multi-family segment?
Andy Florance: I would say that we got the pedal down pretty firmly. We're well over $200 million some million there on that. We're not increasing it, we're easing it off a little bit. But we're still there at a very aggressive pace. So with a little bit of net new investment into Ten-X and LoopNet. But we think we need to balance those investments across the whole portfolio and we think the ROI in LoopNet and Ten-X will be more impactful over the next two to three years in a similar investment Apartments.com. That's not to say anything negative about Apartments.com but we've had the pedal down pretty hard there for a while.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Pete Christiansen: Andy, obviously outside of CoreLogic how are you feeling about the M&A environment. Are there other potential assets out there that are of interest and how are you feeling about the valuations for potential acquisitions?
Andy Florance: Sure. So other than that $6.9 billion or $7 billion deal up here. There actually are other things out there that we are engaged with and developing. We have definitely - and so that is not the only thing occurring - there are things occurring. They all have a similar theme right now for us. They're all going - supporting the kinds of directions you're already familiar with, they're just strategic building blocks on the same theme. The valuations I would say that I have certainly seen a couple of deals going by at valuations that left me very, very comfortable not to participate. I took my hat off this [indiscernible] and said, wow, good work that's a heck of valuation. But there are couple things recently and usually my scepticism on some of the valuations I've seen in some places recently are around the total addressable market relative to the valuation. So maybe performing well in their context or in their field. But their field is relatively small, it doesn't have a long-term growth. There's [indiscernible] frothiness out there but there are also some real value place out there that we're focused on.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tomasello: Andy, I was hoping you could dive a bit deeper into your strategy for entering the residential portal space. There's obviously a lot to talk about there. But I think one key question, is how you intend to cost effectively build consume traffic considering the existing well branded competition in that space. What traffic synergies do you think the existing Apartments.com audience can provide? And is there any competitive advantage that Homesnap's strong user base of agents can bring to help you build that consumer traffic on the residential side?
Andy Florance: Yes so, we're not - but we've obviously been thinking about this and building that strategy and we believe there is a pathway to build organic traffic very cost effectively. We're not in a position to share our thinking on some of that right now for competitive reasons. I think that these things building traffic does not happen overnight. I mean these things you build this up through time. We obviously know how to build up traffic through time, we've done that. Anytime we enter into a new space and try to build traffic there's generally scepticism that you can build traffic in that space through time and we've proven we can do that. And in particular, we entered the apartment space seven years after Zillow had made a significant priority and we ultimately were clearly more successful in doing that. I think one of the important considerations as you build a marketplace or build a traffic on a marketplace is what if your revenue model and how strong is that revenue model and will that revenue model fund investments to continue growing traffic or is your revenue model actually drag on your ability to grow traffic? And I think we see those conditions existing in the home sell market. Definitely Homesnap is a useful component in this and there's one or two other useful components that we're looking at. There's no guarantees on any of these things but we're pretty excited to get working on it and we have a pretty clear view as to where we think we can take it and how we can get it. And I'm sorry, I can't give you more detail and stuff. But I want to have success in telling you about it. We'll make it less likely.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Commercial property and land saw step up in organic revenue growth this quarter as you continue to sell higher tier ads in LoopNet and you're guiding the further acceleration in 2021. How much of your client base do you believe you penetrated with higher tier ads in LoopNet and how sustainable is 15% to 20% plus organic growth in commercial property and lands?
Andy Florance: I really appreciate that question. I really do. So we have just I mean it is really early, early days on these higher tier ads. So we've been very successful with that standard ad placement. In fact in some markets we have too much penetration. In Southern Florida, we might be 87% penetrated which I think is too high. But I think we're less than 1% penetrated in these higher tier ads and that's because we've just begun to really focus on bring them out as you remember. We acquired LoopNet. We separate out the information site from LoopNet, upselling to CoStar and then began developing more fully potentially LoopNet marketplace. We began aggressively bringing the Apartments.com style tiered advertising levels into LoopNet, last year was the first time we began doing this. So this is really the first year of doing that properly and aggressively and you have I think there's - if we have 1,000 or 75,000 we're keeping an eye on. But you have two components moving. One is, penetration into which properties want to move up that prominence level of LoopNet and the other is, what people are willing to pay for that top position and both those items are moving. So it's sustainable for a decade or more, I feel comfortably that we could sustain this for a long, long time.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: On the opportunity to upsell existing comps and tenant module clients into suites and that's where the innovation is going. Can you just help size up how big of an opportunity that is, like how much of the revenue base for that line item is still for comp or tenant module clients? How much uplift do you typically see when they transition over to Suite, etc? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Sure. So I'm going to be giving you, these are not precise numbers. I'm just going to give you numbers that are an educated guesstimate in order to give you a feel. I believe probably 15%, 20% of that customer base is not on the full Suite. And I think that typically it is a doubling as they go into the full Suite. And anytime you do something later, that's when it's time for us to do this and I think it's an opportunity that on reflection maybe we should have done it last year. But now as we bring in the CMBS and the international and the STR and we think we have another three or four innovations coming into and they're equally powerful. As we keep doing this, we need to - it's time to leave behind these partial solutions. This just doesn't represent our brand well - it actually saves us money to stop supporting these lesser modules. So I think it's in the tens of millions of potential revenues comfortably. And I think, more importantly, I think when it's done. I think the customer is happier. I think they appreciate a much more powerful product and they just - [indiscernible] don't know what they don't have.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: My one question is, Scott you mentioned the TTM retention rate. I think you said it was 90 this quarter versus 89 last quarter. That's a question that we've gotten a lot and we obviously paid a lot of attention to that. Could you unpack that a little more? Is that small brokers not maybe going out of business as much as we thought? It is large brokers spending more? Is there a lever in there that could give us more comfort in the resilience of that in the face what could be a pretty tough CRE market? Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, sure Brett. The concerns as we went through the first to second quarter downturn was where were these renewal rates bottom out and if you recall, they went from 90% down to into the low 80s in the last recession and so we watched closely really by customer type and customer size. Large customers all stayed with us. There was really increase at all in drop off rates from anyone that was five or six brokers or more or in the owner categories. It was the small brokers that dropped out over the summer time which also led to a little bit increase in our bad debt. We saw in the later part of the year that certainly has trickled off and stabilized. We're seeing all property - all customer types as well as customer sizes now are back [indiscernible] the renewal rates that we were seeing in the beginning in the year at the end of last year. So it feels like, those that were going to drop out have dropped out and the rest are operating in a stable way and our sales are picking up. So momentum is good. Direct of travel is good and we think that will continue into 2021.
Operator: Your next question is from line of Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Mario Cortellacci: Maybe even with sort of continue with that thought on retention and actually maybe can you talk more about your sales cycle, during Q2 last year that was more or less frozen, the decision making based [indiscernible]. And I just wanted to see, do you think some of the success in the back half of the year was just some of that Q2 being pushed to the right or is it more or less sustainable going into 2021 and even maybe with a ramping in GDP in economic activity in 2021. Is there a lot of room for you guys to beat your guide based on that?
Scott Wheeler: When we saw the response in mid 2021 especially in the marketplaces with the online traffic going to record levels and then the sales accelerating. We assumed, one there's clearly pandemic effect in there and then there's I think a continued longer-term adoption that will stick from that in that experience both from a customer perspective and our sales effectiveness perspective. So certainly there's more online eyeballs, there's more effectiveness to the online advertising and the effectiveness of our media that our customers can use to tour properties. Clearly are big hit in the year. On the other side our sale effectiveness in our Apartments.com salesforce able to effectively and professionally connect with our customers and prospects through Zoom and remote working. They actually produce thousands of more effective customer meetings and maintain their same high NPS scores throughout the year. Allowing them to generate more sales per person than they have it [indiscernible] before. So we don't see either of those trends backing down either as we come out at the end of this year or going into next year. and with the momentum we have building our midmarket salesforce which we will increase, the growth we're starting to see in the IO [ph] property space and then the translation of those same effects into LoopNet as we build our separate salesforce in the LoopNet marketplace. I think we're going to see that same strength and that same momentum building throughout the year and we'll still have the CoStar salesforce selling the LoopNet marketplace products as well until that LoopNet force is built up to full speed. So I think we have a lot of momentum behind us, add a good bit of marketing to LoopNet and the future is certainly bright with our sales efforts as I assume.
Andy Florance: And Nathan [ph] it doesn't make it, we'll take it out with Ten-X.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sheldon: On Ten-X, you talked about not investing heavily yet on the supply side. Have you seen any momentum on the supply side I guess in the second half of 2020 with momentum you had bringing in more bidders? And then related to Ten-X, any update on what you see in terms of distress property sales and have you assumed any pick up in distressed activity in the 2021 or would that be potential upside?
Andy Florance: Okay, so starting with the second question first. We have not assumed any pickup and distressed, that maybe possible that will happen. Especially as a return to normalcy some folks will at that point calculate, it just doesn't work anymore - their property income sheet doesn't work anymore, their LTV doesn't work anymore. So I think there could be but it's not in our forecast. We actually are - so we closed that in June.
Scott Wheeler: Yes.
Andy Florance: So it hasn't been long. So we really jumped into this with both feet and we're really just on the demand side because that's the first component you got to build. And it's really a bit early to really expect any movement on the supply side because we're just now beginning to turn in results. I was wandering through my neighbour the other day I saw two guys drinking a lot of beers and chipping golf balls in their front lawn. I stopped and say hello to them. We chatted a little bit. [Indiscernible] had just bought four multi-family properties to Ten-X that he didn't expect to sell and he was really kind of blown away, they sold with the number of bidders. I love the fact that a neighbour was surprised with how many bidders we had. I think actually he was visiting a neighbour. So that story gets around. He's going to tell people. He's with a big brokerage firm that will get around. But some of the - that's slower. That's what we're making in marketing in 2021 I think absolutely will drive the supply side. So the broad media campaigns about the value, don't auction it. Ten-X it. Don't sell it. Ten-X it. That will reach a lot of the supply side. Our performance numbers that we can use as sales demonstrations are fantastic and those will be very compelling. Also the gamification of the product where we hope to bring in hundreds of thousands of players on the supply side and educate them in the platform while they're having fun and winning some prizes. I think that will drive the supply side. We're educating Lisa Ruggles massive team in Richmond, Virginia to educate the people. They talk to all the time when they first bring a property to market and they're going to educate them about the opportunities on Ten-X that should drive the supply side and then as we grow the number of sales people that will grow the supply side. So I hope that by the end of 2021, we can report really good progress on both the number of bidders showing up to each property and the number of total properties going to market and the trade rate and if those things are all coming together, there is the potential for a very significant network effect and that's because the results you get from aggregating a huge community to buyers on an online marketplace is in almost all cases vastly superior to an offline anecdotal email blast kind of non-scale marketplace. So I like where it's going. I hope we can share real progress on the supply side and demand side next year and that's what we're working towards. But I'm really pleased with what we've done since just the July close. So and I think the Head of Ten-X is on his way over here after the call to work on some more stuff with us. So anyhow. I think that is probably the last question we had.
Bill Warmington: That is correct.
Andy Florance: And so I think we can wrap up the call and we certainly Scott, Bill and I certainly appreciate you joining us for this fourth quarter year-end earnings call and we look forward to updating you on more interesting developments in earnings calls in the near future and I apologize for our robustness today. There are few more extra things going on.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q3 2020 CoStar Group Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Ms. Sarah Spray. Please go ahead.

And with that, I would like to turn over to our Founder and CEO, Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Good evening and thank you for joining us today for CoStar Group's third quarter 2020 earnings call. Total third quarter revenue was $426 million, up 21% year-over-year. For 20 years, CoStar has grown revenue 20% plus on a compound annual basis. Our performance this quarter is no different and shows clear evidence that in the midst of this pandemic, our business is strong, resilient and countercyclical. In the third quarter of 2020, all of our businesses performed well and continue to be solid, resilient and showed the performance that we saw as we exit the second quarter. In the third quarter, we achieved $53 million in quarterly sales bookings, a 53% increase over Q2 sales bookings. This was one of our strongest sales quarters ever despite the continued high levels of economic, social and public health uncertainty. Our marketplace businesses displayed very strong countercyclical growth with Apartments.com revenue up 23% in the third quarter 2020 over the third quarter of 2019. Similarly LoopNet revenue was up 19% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our earnings in the third quarter were very strong with net income of $58 million and adjusted EBITDA of $134 million. Our sales team at Apartments.com turned in one of their best performances ever in the third quarter with net new sales up a massive 59% versus the same quarter a year ago. Customers continue to invest in Apartments.com because of the strong and growing lead flow we deliver driven by growing site traffic and engagement. During the quarter, we set yet another record for site traffic. According to ComScore, for the third quarter, average unique visitors per month to the Apartments.com network of sites in the quarter was over 25 million, up 20% from the same quarter a year ago. The growth in lead flow was even stronger as total leads generated for our clients from the Apartments.com network of sites in the quarter was up 43% over the prior year quarter being the previous record by 16%. Our increased investment in marketing is driving these gains and allowing us to further distance ourselves from our competition. According to ComScore, in the third quarter, Apartments.com had 2.3 times as many unique visitors as RentPath, nine times as many as Zumper, 12 times as many as Apartment List and 22% more than the Zillow rental network. Third quarter over second quarter of 2020, the Apartments.com network added 14.5 million visits sequentially while RentPath went down 5.3 million visits. We believe that customers take notice of and care about the huge traffic and lead advantage Apartments.com offers them. Our customers routinely tell us who they are marketing with, including where they're marketing with RentPath. Since beginning of 2020, we estimate that we have added 36 million in annualized revenue to Apartments.com for multi-family properties that we're advertising on RentPath. We have added thousands of new properties as advertisers on Apartments.com this year. During the same time period, we do not believe that RentPath has grown their revenue. In fact, we can see from their advertised sales promotions, they're shifting their focus to reselling advertising solutions that in fact compete with ApartmentGuide and Rent.com. RentPath offers services placing ads for apartment communities on Facebook, social media, Google SCM and the like. They may be doing this because their core sites are less and less attractive to advertisers. We believe that the shift in their business has shift to lower margin less differentiated product. From when we entered into an agreement to acquire RentPath before any of us had ever heard of COVID, it seems like the world has changed. While we continue to seek approval at the Federal Trade Commission to close on our acquisition of RentPath, right now we're very focused on laying the groundwork for a very strong 2021 for Apartments.com. We believe that the total addressable for Apartments.com is huge and growing. In the U.S., 51% of the larger apartment communities was at least 100 units are advertising on Apartments.com. Our penetration of the multi-family market continues to grow as we added 879 more of these 100 unit plus communities this quarter alone with an overall average revenue per property of $1,060 per month. The opportunity to grow our client base and the properties was less than 100 units is much more exciting. They're both exciting, but the smaller mid-sized opportunities is really remarkable. Just 3% of the over 35 – 350,000 apartment communities with 5 to 100 units currently advertise with us. That's 3% of the 350,000 5 to 100 unit cadence are advertising, but that customer segment is growing at twice the rate of the larger 100 unit plus community advertisers. In the previous quarter alone, 820 communities with 5 to 100 units began new advertising relationships with us for an overall average revenue per property per month of $536. The broadest opportunity of all is to provide marketing and leasing solutions to the 18 million properties with one to four units. So far this year, we've sold about 5,900 ads to the one to four unit properties, including almost 2,700 in the third quarter at an average price of $150 per month. We are successfully adding clients from large, medium and small rental properties. This quarter, we blew pass the $600 million run rate in annualized revenue and yet we only sold advertising to less than 1% of the U.S. rental properties. We clearly have a huge opportunity here and intend to invest in growing our Apartments sales force into 2021 to capture more of this opportunity and the potential for high incremental margins. The Apartments.com brand is well positioned to capture this opportunity as I can argue Apartments.com is becoming a household name and part of the culture. As many of you seen, the proof point is the wonderful free advertising received earlier this month from the writers at Saturday Night Live. In the VP Fly Debate Cold Open, Jim Carrey playing Jeff Goldblum as the fly on Vice President Pence's head delivers our slogan Apartments.com is the place to find a place, while the Apartments.com logo displays tens of millions of viewers watched that awesome free placement. This quarter LoopNet was also able to prove resilient and countercyclical, recording a new all-time high in net new sales and year-over-year revenue growth of 19%. In the third quarter, LoopNet's record high and average monthly unique visitors at 8.3 million supported that revenue growth. That higher traffic drove a 70% increase in email and fun leads to our LoopNet advertisers in Q3 versus Q1 2020. We have implemented a comprehensive retargeting program this year, which we believe is instrumental to achieving both this growth in traffic and leads. LoopNet's strong traffic is driving strong sales of Diamond ads, our most prominent level, which reached a price point of $11,000 per month, an average $3,260 per month in the quarter. It's a bargain price point when compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars of potential lease route that these ads are marketing. At the same time, it's a huge number compared to the average price point of only $10 to $20 a month that the LoopNet was getting when we purchased LoopNet a little more than eight years ago. I'm convinced that LoopNet opportunity is just as big as Apartments.com. As we begin making plans for LoopNet in 2021, we intend to invest in growing both our sales force and our marketing with an eye to accelerating our revenue growth even faster. We are working with our advertising agency to build a powerful LoopNet marketing campaign for 2021 that will encourage both owners and brokers to unleash their digital potential by being in the know, by being in the loop. It's a bit of a retro campaign and that getting in the loop was one of the first campaigns for LoopNet back at its founding. But since we acquired LoopNet, the platform has certainly transformed from a slow growing website, offering ads, cheap ads on lower class B properties to the premier marketplace for world-class commercial real estate. We believe that now is the time to bring the LoopNet image and marketing up to the top level. You will know when we have achieved our goal when you hear the LoopNet slogan used in a future Saturday Night Live Cold Open Pence, Harris presidential debate four years from now. As LoopNet grows, we're adjusting our organizational structure continue to facilitate that growth. Going forward LoopNet's organizational structure will more mirror the Apartments.com organization, which we believe will allow it to focus fully on developing the growth potential of LoopNet where LoopNet in the past has shared leadership across product design, sales, customer service and marketing with CoStar going forward we'll have a dedicated management team within CoStar Group focused just on LoopNet growth. While the CoStar sales team will continue to sell CoStar for the foreseeable future, we have named James Moon, a veteran of the Apartments.com leadership team to Senior Vice President leading LoopNet's sales. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we plan to build out a dedicated LoopNet sales team with an incremental 100 to 200 sales professionals. We intend to announce a President of the LoopNet organization within the next month. We plan to place additional LoopNet leadership positions over the next few months. I want to highlight that all of our marketplaces are growing traffic. BizBuySell, hit a new record in average monthly unique visitors this quarter. The LandsofAmerica network also set a record this quarter and is now growing so fast. It's approaching LoopNet's traffic level with 6.8 million monthly unique visitors. The lands network monthly unique visitor counts soared 80% year-over-year. We complete our acquisition of Ten-X at the end of the second quarter this year. And after only three months with a business, I'm more excited than ever about its potential. One of the first steps we've taken is to put any property going to auction on Ten-X to the top of LoopNet and CoStar and present them as upgraded diamond placements with enhanced retargeting. This is dramatically increasing their exposure to potential bitters. The benefit was immediate and dramatic. On the auctions that took place following this upgrade exposure, we saw the number of qualified bidders coming to Ten-X jump by 47%. We also observed a 19 percentage point increase in trade rate to 68% versus prior year. The trade rate is a percentage of the successful sales at auction divided by total number of properties brought to that auction. This trade rate of 68% is groundbreaking. Based on CoStar and LoopNet data on sales transactions over the past three years or even longer, the trade rate on traditional offline commercial real estate sales transactions is only 36%, 64% do not sell on their first listing. The minority that did sell were on the market for an average of 500 days before they sold. Obviously specific properties vary widely, but those are pretty depressing numbers. Property selling in the traditional method took five times as long to sell on average compared to the 90 days it takes to sell a property in Ten-X. On Ten-X, both sellers and brokers have a higher probability of closing the sale at a much faster pace. Hypothetically, a broker utilizing Ten-X can sell twice as many properties in a quarter as an offline broker can sell in a year. We believe that that is a major game changer, a potentially apt comparisons of traditional commercial real estate sales market is back to the days of the OTC Pink sheets, which is a slow, expensive, illiquid and not very transparent market. We believe that Ten-X could be comparable to the advent of NASDAQ in the '90s, which dramatically increased price transparency, volume and liquidity in the OTC markets. The upside potential for every player in the commercial real estate market is tremendous and good. We are prioritizing the integration of Ten-X technology with both CoStar and LoopNet to be ready for what could be a significant wave of distressed properties coming to the market in the next 12 to 24 months. We will soon have reached real-time information on properties coming to auction fed directly to CoStar and LoopNet, creating additional exposure and interest from our 150,000 plus CoStar users and 7.8 million monthly LoopNet visitors. The full merger of the two back ends is expected to be achieved during 2021. Ten-X is an exciting space to watch, even from an operational perspective I think that once we get those real-time feeds going, everyone would be glued to their screens as the auctions take place. Costar has continued to grow through the pandemic despite the pandemic's negative impact on commercial real estate. CoStar revenue grew 6% in Q3 over the same quarter a year ago. Net sales bookings surge back from a soft second quarter growing 146% third quarter over second quarter of 2020. Considering the skill of disruption to commercial real estate this year, I'm very impressed with our team's ability to maintain a strong renewal rate as we have. The vast majority of cancellations from the second quarter occurred among small one and two agent broker shops. Over the past six months, only six firms with five or more brokers have canceled their contracts. Clearly, demonstrating the information analytics that CoStar provides are truly mission critical. I'm very optimistic about CoStar's potential moving into 2021. Just one of our headline product enhancements in the pipeline for CoStar is the integration of robust CMBS data into CoStar. The CMBS data includes deep information on over a hundred thousand commercial estate loans with 90,000 tenant lease expiration dates, 40,000 detailed operating statements and details of thousands of distressed loans. CoStar customers will be able to search for properties based on loan maturity date and payment status. They'll have access to detailed operating statements on a property level and tenant lease expiration dates. We'll build income and expense models that customers can use to build their assumptions on acquisitions, valuations or developments. We will be able to use this data to inform our forecast models and analytics, and to enhance our overall research efforts. I'm also excited about the multitude of major enhancements we have in the work as we integrate hospitality information into CoStar. We are close to integrating all of STR's properties into the CoStar database. We are building a suite of hospitality analytic tools into CoStar that we believe will be the best-in-class. We have designed the next phase of developments to migrate the STR benchmarking capabilities from emailed worksheets to a fully digitized end-to-end SaaS benchmarking solution for the hospitality industry, all integrated with CoStar. We aim to offer a broad range of functionalities, including a dashboard view of traditional benchmarks such as RevPAR and all the star reports and also the P&L metrics and forward booking data. The tool will have enhanced portfolio analytics. I believe that this is a potential killer app in the hospitality segment. While the analytics and benchmarking we are building here are specific to hospitality, I think it's particularly exciting because it creates a proof-of-concept for CoStar's ability to deliver robust benchmarking across other commercial real estate asset classes in the future. In addition, we have made excellent progress in our track to deliver a full featured internationalized and polyglot version of CoStar in 2021. If you think Siri analytics are cool, both of you, then you would love seeing our new capabilities to generate on-the-fly, real-time, aggregated comparative analytics from multiple countries, multiple languages and multiple currencies all presented in the currency localization and language of the user's choice. So exciting. Given the progress on international CoStar, it's timely that we're announcing today the closing of our purchase of Emporis, a German-based international commercial real estate data provider. Acquiring Emporis allows us to integrate their 700,000 building records, and over 600,000 images across 100 countries into CoStar, providing a jumpstart to our international data collection efforts. In 2021, we plan to integrate, enhance the international data we have from our existing operations, and Spain and Germany into CoStar. Beyond this, we've identified additional 50 international cities that we plan to add to CoStar with cost efficient data collection efforts, initiated over the course of the next 24 months. We believe that market opportunity for us internationally is more than twice the market opportunity in North America. If you've noticed over the past six months, we've increased our cash reserves through a combination of equity and debt funding to almost $4 billion in cash. I expect that the questions at the end of this call will be similar to every prior call and that someone will rightfully ask; where are you with merger and acquisitions? Given that I cannot discuss specific targets or potential transactions, I thought it's helpful to clarify what we look for and the criteria we apply when we're evaluating acquisition opportunities. So let me answer the quick question advance, but likely the question will be asked anyhow during Q&A just slightly differently, but nuance is fun. We're a disciplined acquirer. Our strong balance sheet and stated intention to deploy our cash for M&A have attracted attention from practically anybody considering selling their business in the proptech space. It's a big group. There are currently 7,000 proptech companies trying to create value by digitizing real estate. It's our practice to be open-minded and talk to everyone and consider carefully all potential acquisition opportunities; the vast majority of which we don't pursue. For the ones that we do not pursue, it could be because they're too far field, too far, from what we do, overvalued not strategically valuable, too small, throw red flags and due diligence, or have no clear path to accelerate growth among other reasons. One common theme for us has been to use acquisitions to enter a new closely related real estate segment. For example, we acquired national retail Bureau to jumpstart our retail entry. We acquired Apartments.com to enter the apartment sector. We acquired STR to enter hospitality. We acquired LandsofAmerica as a rural land space. In these cases, 75% of the technology and processes are identical to what we already do, maybe more than 75%. Placing a point on map at geo query presenting acres and square feet, property photos, and videos, property characteristics, marketplaces, aggregate analytics, and more are the same from one property type to another. Our expertise in one sector enables us to innovate quickly into a new segment. We believe that each time we add a new property segment, our solutions become more valuable to many of our clients because we offer them a more comprehensive solution to their needs. Banks almost always lend money across many property types. Praisers often value almost always more than just one property type. Brokers transact across multiple property types. Local government deals with all kinds of property types. Owners often own more than just one property type. Giving these clients consistent convenient information solutions in one integrated offering is invaluable to them. Another theme for us is to target entering closer related solutions in the same property segment. For example, CoStar is and was a strong commercial real estate information solutions provider with a lot of data. And by acquiring LoopNet, we added commercial real estate market expertise and revenue. The commercial real estate information resources we already had allowed us to quickly innovate the marketplace solutions, LoopNet offered making them more valuable to searchers. Once we integrate the data behind LoopNet and CoStar each product essentially generates free data for the other as a by-product making each more valuable. We sometimes acquire companies with complimentary geographic footprints with similar segment coverage and solutions in order to accelerate our geographic expansion efforts. We built-up much of our U.S. coverage, 10 years to 15 years ago this way, and some of the European coverage about 10 years ago, five years ago. We often prefer to buy companies that are slow growing, where we believe we see strategies to accelerate their growth rate. We have a strong track record of buying slow growing companies and accelerating their growth rates. Today, Apartments.com is 6 times the size it was when we acquired it. LoopNet is over 4 times. Real Estate Manager is almost 6 times as big, and COMPS.com is over 8 times as big. Most of these companies were growing in the low single-digits, if at all when we acquired them and we then accelerated them to strong consistent, double-digit growth. We jumped when we see a chance to acquire a larger company that has a similar product with redundant cost structures. Our acquisition of ForRent is a good example of acquiring a company, eliminating most of the cost structure while maintaining most of the revenue. It's great when you can do a deal where you're converting revenue into EBITDA. We prefer to acquire larger companies to have obtained scale results for relatively the same efforts; it's called the Frank Carchedi theory. Since acquiring small or large company seemed to take about the same amount of effort to do right, it makes sense to acquire larger ones. We generally invest in smaller companies only to obtain strategic new product solutions or for the purpose of research and development. Each of the acquisitions we consider must have multiple opportunities to create significant growth and profit for the business. Otherwise we typically pass on the deal. With this approach, it only takes one of multiple possible investment theses to pan out in order for these acquisition to succeed. Historically, we've taken a balanced to conservative approach to financing acquisitions. Over the past 10 years, we've deployed approximately $6 billion for acquisitions and have leveraged operating cash, equity raises and short-term debt in roughly equal parts to fund these deals. We anticipate continuing this balanced funding approach in the future with one additional criteria as a result of our debt offering. Going forward, we're absolutely committed to protecting and maintaining our investment grade credit rating. Finally, I'm going to wrap up with some observations about the real estate economy, looking to the economy and the current state of the commercial real estate. We see a labor market recover that is noticeably slowing. Furloughed workers contain to be rehired as the economy reopens, but a slower and slower pace each month. The hardest hit sectors the economy like: restaurants, hospitality, and entertainment are struggling to try and reopen safely as colder months of the year approach. And what appears to be a third wave of infections is beginning to ramp up, whereas Dr. Fauci says the first wave. But an interesting thing is happening. Even if the possibility of new stimulus seems to be fading, measures of household and business confidence have been rising recently, and census data of new business formation shows that growth in new companies is up nearly 40% from a year ago, more than triple the growth rate at this time in 2019. This isn't what we normally see during recessions. New business formations fell 15% in 2008 and where zero in 2009. Commercial real estate weathered a tough second quarter and showed resilience in Q3 2020, even the hardest hit sectors of the market. Hotel occupancy continued to slow ground higher reaching 50% by quarter-end. Parts of the retail landscape clearly remain challenged by reduced traffic and social distancing mandates. But I should know that leasing volumes recovered strongly for retail assets in the third quarter. Retail properties leased to essential credit tenants had been a bright spot, as well as discounters and grocery anchored properties. We've seen groceries taking over previously challenged spaces, vacated by home good retailers and even booksellers. This is maybe a good time to note that Amazon opened its first physical grocery store during the third quarter called Amazon Fresh; there is still plenty of distress to work out in retail and hospitality. And we're continuing to see increased usage of the product from our clients and asset management credit and especially valuation departments. We've heard from clients that CoStar's clients – that CoStar services are more mission critical now than ever before. And I think that shows in CoStar's resilience. On the other hand, I hardly need to tell you that the industrial sectors enjoyed great tailwinds in the current e-commerce driven environment. CoStar data tells us that the third quarter 2020 was actually a new record for industrial leasing volume. Amazon obviously led the way, but a deep roster of firms are looking to expand their distribution footprints to catch-up. Walmart and Target have been especially active this year. Along with third party logistics firms, home good retailers and a long list of others. The surgeon leasing demand is coming at the perfect time as there's a record amount of space set to deliver in the near term, much of which remains available. The office market has been inundated with headlines for months now with competing stories of this company shifting towards permanent remote work, while another company is starting to move towards a return to office. It seems inevitable there'll be increased adoption of flexible work schedules to some degree, but they'll also be demand for more space for social distancing. It's interesting to note that one of the biggest office deals during the third quarter was Facebook's purchase of a brand new 400,000 square foot office campus in Bellevue, Washington with a price tag of over $350 million. That shows a lot of money to spend in lot of office space. They aren't the only big tech companies buying or leasing office space in the third quarter, the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have been very active acquiring office space. The Multifamily sector has been one of the most fascinating to track over the last seven months. There isn't a lot of high-frequency day in the commercial estate market, but Apartments.com provides us with millions of data points each day on rents and availabilities giving us real time views of the market, a large supply wave of four and five star properties in downtown CBD locations as continued to push those rents lower. After the second quarter produced the lowest net absorption eight years, there were fears of a loss leasing season for 2020, but Q3 absorption rocketed back. It was the largest third quarter ever recorded at CoStar showing that apartment demand is simply been pent-up during the first few months of the quarantine. The 2020 leasing season has simply been delayed and higher vacancies and expensive, newly delivered product are an expanded opportunity set for Apartments.com to help owners to fill those units. The real estate capital markets have begun to show some stabilization. Third quarter deal volume was down 40% from last year, but a closure look shows that each month a quarter got better. September deal volume was only $4 billion short of the average September in the last five years; only $4 billion. A selling of the lending markets has certainly helped as CMBS spreads have come back down from their widest levels and new issuance has picked up. Looking at pricing, our same store price indices indicate valuations have largely plateaued and are showing year-over-year declines or broadly higher cap rates. This is flattening of prices around pre-COVID levels is consistent with what we are hearing from clients. There's still plenty of demand for good assets, and those that trade aren't going for meaningful discounts. More challenged assets are simply not trading, if they don't have to. It seems that few are being forced to trade today as underwriting standards and leverage were more conservative going into this downturn than the last. We know from CMBS delinquency and special servicing rates that a wave of distressed assets and hospitality and retail is coming and the Ten-X platform is expected to give us insight in a investor demand for this properties. We believe the mountain of dry powder waiting on distressed properties is large, which will make an interesting space as we look into 2021 and beyond. This quarter is again, demonstrated that our data and information are mission critical to our customers, that our marking business are counter cyclical. We're extremely pleased with our strong third quarter results and we're very excited about a strong finish to the year and a great 2021 around the quarter. So, and to talk more about the growth, I'm going to ask our CFO, Scott Wheeler to please wear a mask when he's shopping in our store, and then he can deliver his report for the quarter.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I have now removed my mask for all those wondering, while Andy coughs nearby. Actually it's our first earnings call, since what February or, actually together in the same room.
Andy Florance: Isn't it great?
Scott Wheeler: Yes.
Andy Florance: We could also – while Scott's delivering his section, I'm going to manufacture integrated circuits.
Scott Wheeler: All right, what was I talking about? That's right. The recovery; we experienced a great third quarter. Improved off the second quarter and our momentum is building nicely, 53 million in net new bookings for the third quarter. We think is an outstanding result, the second highest ever and it was in the midst of our global pandemic. With these strong sales, our third quarter revenue of $426 million came in $6 million above the high end of our guidance range, resulting in 21% year-over-year growth in the third quarter, which was over 200 basis points above our forecast. That makes 14 quarters in a row with growth at or above 15%. And we have now crossed $1.7 billion in revenue run rate for the business. We now expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 18% for the full year of 2020. Looking at our revenue performance by services; CoStar Suite revenue growth was 6% year-over-year in the third quarter, slightly ahead of our forecast. As sales of CoStar Suite improved sequentially in the third quarter, by over 2 times the level of CoStar Suite sales in the second quarter. Accordingly, we expect revenue growth for CoStar of approximately 7% for the year and approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to prior year. Revenue and information services grew 70% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2020 to $33 million as expected. The revenue growth expectation for the full year remains unchanged at approximately 45% with revenue growth around 14% in the fourth quarter, as we begin to lap the acquisition at STR that occurred in late October of 2019. Without STR, we expect information services revenue in the fourth quarter to be approximately the same as the fourth quarter of 2019. Multifamily revenue growth for the third quarter was outstanding, improving to 23% over the third quarter of 2019. The number of properties advertising with us increased around 10% while the average revenue per property increased by approximately 12%. We expect revenue growth of around 23% to continue in the fourth quarter results in approximately 22% revenue growth for the full year of 2020. Multifamily is now at a run rate of over $600 million in revenue, and on an annual basis is adding approximately $120 million in revenue growth in a year's time. Clearly our Apartments.com operating model is delivering fantastic results. And as Andy mentioned, we're looking forward to replicating that same model for similar results with LoopNet. Commercial property and land revenues grew 38% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2020, slightly ahead of our expectations. And this sector now includes Ten-X for the first time in this quarter. LoopNet marketplace revenue grew 19% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2020 sequentially up a bit from the 18% in the second quarter. LoopNet had the highest sales quarter ever in the third quarter as a result of all time high traffic, improved marketing efforts and a strong effort by our combined CoStar LoopNet sales team. Including Ten-X, we expect full year revenue growth for commercial property land of approximately 25% to 28%. Organically expect full year revenue growth for commercial property and land to be approximately 15% with LoopNet growing 20% for the full year. Our gross margins came in at 82% in the third quarter of 2020, slightly increasing from the 81% gross margin we achieved in the second quarter. We expect overall gross margins, approximately 81% for the full year of 2020. Profitability was strong in our third quarter with net income, Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS results, all ahead of the guidance we issued in July of this year. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $134 million was approximately $9 million above the top end of our guidance range. Most of the improvement came from the higher revenue with some additional benefit and lower G&A costs than expected. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 31% is 200 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range. We increased marketing spend as planned in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, making the third quarter, our highest marketing spend quarter of the year for the first time since we acquired Apartments.com. Cash and investment balances were approximately $3.9 billion as of September 30, 2020, up over $300 million since the last quarter. The cash increased reflects the closing of our investment grade bond offering in early July and repayment of our outstanding revolver balance. Our net cash balance at quarter-end was approximately $2.9 billion and our gross leverage ratio is 1.9X based on $1 billion debt outstanding, and the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EBITDA for the year. We're pleased to see that our bonds have consistently traded at a premium to the initial offer price and remained strongly committed to our investment grade rating as we pursue our M&A objectives. Now we'll look at some of our performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the third quarter, our sales force totaled approximately 860 people in line with the last quarter, excluding the acquired sales teams from STR and Ten-X, which we included in our sales force numbers last quarter, our sales force declined about 6% in 2020 overall. We recently began hiring sales team members to support growth across all our businesses, which is a good sign. And we'll soon start building the LoopNet sales force that Andy mentioned. Renewal rate on annual contracts for the third quarter of 2010 was 89% in line with the second quarter, slightly better than we expected. We're encouraged that the renewal rate has stabilized after only one quarter of downward pressure from this disruption in Q2. Renewal rate for the quarter for customers, who've been subscribers for five years or longer remain strong and steady in line with the 95% renewal rate from the second quarter of 2020. Again the stability in the renewal rate is encouraging, reinforcing the value of our platforms to our customers, especially during periods of disruption in the market. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 79% of our revenue in the third quarter, which is down from the 82% this time last year and last quarter. Decline of 3% as a result of including Ten-X revenue in the calculation for the first time. Ten-X revenue is based on a percentage of the sales value for transactions completed using the Ten-X platform. In total, when we include all subscription contracts, regardless of contract length, approximately 94% of our revenue is subscription-based after including the Ten-X revenue in our calculation. I'll now discuss our outlook for the year and for the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently expect revenue for the full year in a range of $1.644 billion to $1.65 billion, which represents a growth rate of 18% of the midpoint of the range compared to 2019. This revenue outlook represents an increase of $12 million at the midpoint, compared to our prior guidance. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter in the range of $429 million to $435 million representing growth around 15% at the midpoint compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $525 million to $530 million, which is an increase of approximately $8 million at the midpoint of the range from our prior full year guidance. With this increased forecast for adjusted EBITDA, we are now slightly above the midpoint of the full year EBITDA guidance that we provided for 2020 back in February before the pandemic. It certainly wasn't a straight line from there to here, but we're very pleased that our team was able to deliver the profit numbers that we guided to at the start of the year, despite all of the disruption and dislocation For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $139 million to $144 million. With strong traffic growth and record sales levels for LoopNet in the third quarter, we increased marketing spend for LoopNet and Ten-X in the latter part of Q3. We expect to continue this marketing spend level in the fourth quarter of 2020 and beyond in support of expected growth in both of these businesses. This is why our adjusted EBITDA guidance increase is less than the increase in our revenue guidance. Our outlook for the year currently includes a year-over-year increase in our marketing spend of approximately $90 million. Apartments.com represents approximately $70 million to $75 million of the increase with the rest attributable to LoopNet and recently the addition of Ten-X to our business. The success of our marketing campaign is evident in our outstanding traffic, sales and revenue result. We expect full year non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $9.39 to $9.49 per share based on 38.3 million weighted average shares. This is an increase of $0.12 per share from the midpoint of our prior guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $2.34 to $2.44 per share based on 39.5 million shares. I know, some of you undoubtedly are curious about our outlook for 2021, and we're not planning to provide 2021 guidance until after the end of this year, we're currently working for our planning and budget process on the many great growth opportunities we have. We'd like to have the benefit of four more months of results under our belt before we finalize and communicate our plans for 2021. Overall, we remain committed to our long-term objectives of $3 billion in run rate revenue and 40% adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023. In summary, we've certainly had an impressive third quarter. Sales rebounded strongly from the early phase of the pandemic, and our momentum continues into the fourth quarter. We expect to exit the year with strong double digit revenue growth, both in total and organic revenue growth, despite the continuing global pandemic and uncertain economic environment. Our balance sheet is rock solid and ready to support significant acquisition driven expansion, while we remain committed to maintaining our fresh brand new investment grade credit rating. So thank you for your time and your support. I look forward to updating you on this year's results and discussing our 2021 operating plans in February 2021. With that operator, we can now open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from a line of Pete Christiansen of Citi. Please go ahead.
Pete Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the question. Nice trends, gentlemen. I wanted to dig into the growth that you're seeing in Multifamily bookings a bit and there's this notion that you have a bifurcation in the market between metro and suburban areas. They can see as growing in metro areas, higher competition in suburban areas. Can you talk about what you're seeing from a sales perspective, where is the platform really winning today?
Andy Florance: I don't think we have our sales results broken down by urban and suburban. But my sense of it is that we are seeing – we're going to be seeing strong sales in the CBDs because there are a lot of properties in the central business districts that are in lease-up. There's been a high supply there, and those folks would have well ahead of any disruption would have allocated significant investment for marketing for lease-up. But at the same time we haven't heard anything to indicate that suburban properties aren't also accelerating their investment in Apartments.com. So it's across the board that we're seeing this. I think one of the more exciting things is when you look at that number for accelerated sales into one to four units, which has both suburban and CBD. You can see that, I mean, year-to-date, I think there was 5,700, 5,900 and half of the sales occurred in the last quarter. And that's that mid-market sales team and they're basically geographically independent. They're covering suburban, urban, rural, the whole nine yards; so good pacing on that across the board there.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Mayank Tandon of Needham. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Andy, you mentioned the international opportunity to ex-domestic. Just want to get your thoughts on sort of how you go about building it out? Is it still market-by-market? I think you launched Madrid like several years ago and then you did that deal in UK, Realla I believe. And then you got this deal announce today. Just want to get your thoughts on inorganic versus organic to take advantage of the opportunity internationally? Thank you.
Andy Florance: Sure. So Sarah Spray is holding up her hand saying it's 3 times the – the global opportunity is 3 times U.S. opportunity. I in editing the script sandbagged it down to two-x the opportunity. So we could debate the semantics of potential there, but we can all agree it's large. And the nice thing about it is it's also, it continues to differentiate us as a particularly valuable vendor to folks who are flowing capital across border. So when you look at some of the bigger markets London, New York often more than half as much as 70% of the capital going into investment grade properties is crossing borders. So building a good international solution is particularly valuable to a lot of our best clients. I don't think we have the same opportunity to acquire in the traditional commercial real estate space internationally. Like we're just well ahead of any other solutions out there around the world, I mean, there are a couple of little players here and there, but not quite the same opportunity we have here in the United States. We are – the new international CoStar really looks quite impressive when you see it, you'll think, okay, that's really nice. It's very elegant. And our thought is, is that our clients are subscribed to national data in their countries will just be able to see properties around the world. And the addition of Emporis allows us to really crank up what they're going to see when we integrate that in. So as soon as we finished that someone in New York would be able to see thousands of properties in San Paulo or in Buenos Aires or in Tokyo. And now we won't have the same level of detail that we have on CoStar properties in London or New York or Richmond, but it'll still be a decent content. Our plan is to focus first on integrating in Germany and Spain, where we already have a wealth of content, get that in there. And then we've identified on a crazy number of parameters, but I won't go into a target set of countries and a pacing for those countries based liquidity, transparency, availability of data, bunch of other things. And we're going to start with a light model. We might put a team of five or 10 folks into Portugal and focus on comparable sales news, market analytics, comparable cell research and then scraping a lot of the availability content, user data. And we're going to treat it a little bit like we treat the United States where we did flights of cities. We didn't do one at a time. We did five at a time, 10 at a time, so we'll flight cities and we'll just keep working at it until we've gotten through our initial hit list of about 50. And we'll put one or two salespeople in each one of these markets. Again, these are – these investments are not nearly as large as the investments we made when we went into the United Kingdom or be relying more on scraping and user entry, which is become bigger and bigger for us; and then also uploading – digitally uploading user content. So it'd be – it's an odd time to do it when you can't cross an international border by the time we're – but by the time we've got everything ready to go, anticipate that you will be able to cross borders again.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Tomasello: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. The for-sale of housing market is clearly seeing an acceleration in demand, which I think has a lot of people wondering if this represents a secular shift in home ownership preferences. So my question is with that as a backdrop, is there any desire to expand CoStar's footprint in housing, beyond the rental market? What types of areas of that sector could make more sense and be most complimentary for example, anything on the marketplace side, or perhaps on the construction data side, that would be an interesting area for CoStar?
Andy Florance: Yes. So I mean, there are a lot of different sub-sectors, just like there are a lot of different sectors in the commercial real estate information and marketplace area. There are a lot of sectors in the residential side. I think that it's good to know that CoStar Group actually began life as a residential information business. So when I first started up, I was doing assessor recorder deeds and downloading MLS data. So actually we started residential. We focused on commercial, obviously. Looking at similarities we're talking about the construction data areas, interesting, historically not terribly interesting for a number of different reasons. There's – there are information services, there are lending services, there are marketplaces. I would note one of the things that really stands out for me is that the United States is a oddly underdeveloped country when it comes to residential marketplaces. If I look at a mature residential market place provider like REA Group in Australia, and I take the relative size of U.S. and Australia on a GDP basis, it would imply that you create a market cap of about $200 billion in the U.S. on a residential marketplace. You create $1billion plus of EBITDA in that area and yet, no one's really doing a good job of there. Same thing with the right move in the United Kingdom, if you just take their 50%-plus margins, I think they're 60%, 70% of margins, but they're huge. And you just scale them to the U.S. there's clearly a lot of opportunities in the U.S. that are underdeveloped, while people are moving in away from really pure digital models and getting into actually becoming players in brokerage and flipping and mortgages and, so I think there's some big opportunities out there nothing to talk about today, but very focused on it. And it's an area we feel very comfortable with because we've been working with that space for a while. You can see we're selling a lot of product that what an essence or houses for Apartments.com recently. So it's interesting we're keeping an eye on it and we're – there's nothing remarkably different about the picture of a house, a dot on a map for a house, a dot on a map for a building, assessor parcel record for an industrial building or a house or a walk-up, so all very similar. But again, the whole space of digital real estate is just massive and unlimited amount of opportunity.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Mario Cortellacci from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Mario Cortellacci: Hi. Thanks for the time. I'm just curious about Q3 new bookings. And I know that Q2, a majority of it was in June, and I'm assuming that that pent-up demand carried over into Q3. So I just wanted to get a sense for what the cadence of the net new bookings were throughout the quarter. And then maybe you can even go a level deeper and maybe give us a sense for what the cadence was for CoStar Suite and LoopNet and Apartments.com. Just to get a sense for which was when it may have accelerated versus which may have just had that, that pent-up demand and had maybe the first month be the largest?
Andy Florance: Sure. Let me – let me take a shot at helping you with that one, Mario. The phenomenon we saw in the second quarter was clearly one of significant disruption early in the quarter, and then with strong rebound particularly led by Apartments.com and the marketplaces. I think when I look at the pattern that we saw in the third quarter it was really pretty well distributed. There wasn't a slowing in the first month and then a big acceleration to the end. It was pretty evenly balanced. I, I think that pent-up demand that came out of April and possibly may, a lot of that came into June and then it's sustained itself pretty strongly in the third quarter across all of the months. That typically the third quarter or the third month of any quarter is our strongest from a sales perspective. And that's as much just with sales, pacing and making the quarter closings of the sales force s focus on. But I think if you look at each of the businesses, the marketplaces were very steady sequentially on the quarters, multifamily tends to come off in the third quarter versus the second quarter numbers that seasonally same thing this year, but it was still very strong versus last year that Andy mentioned. And then, LoopNet performs strongly across all the months. Information services the same with probably some slight growth as STR continues to just month-to-month do well with its customers and CoStar, I think had a very solid pattern across the quarter as well with no major real cycles to point out. So I think it was pretty evenly balanced and more so than actually some other quarters. So it's encouraging that we've seen that and that hopefully we'll see those same strength carry into the fourth quarter.
Scott Wheeler: I think the standout was probably LoopNet really, the CoStar sales force I felt it came pretty positive about the LoopNet product and the potential for that as the quarter went on.
Operator: Next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi guys.
Andy Florance: Hey, Sterling.
Sterling Auty: I missed a few set of questions. Can you guys give us some more detail on the acquisition that you made? You gave some of the properties, but what is the price paid for an asset like that? And how much does that jumpstart your ability to really get kicked off in that region?
Andy Florance: Yes. So I'll let Scott comment on the price. I think he'll say diminimous. I think it's in line with a coffee budget. And lately we haven't been using much coffee here, though I did buy my own milk for the headquarters today. So the – yes, so it's a relatively small purchase price – a small revenue stream. It's a company I've known. I've known the founders and the principals for a number of years. It's recently been acquired a couple of years ago. I think I've known this company for 10 or I think I went over to visit them 15 years ago, or 12, 15 years ago. They have a network of photographers and researchers who are volunteers, sort of like Wiki around the world who go around to take pictures of buildings and collect data about who the architects are, the construction company. They're focus intent. They initially focused intensely on skyscrapers. They gave an annual award for the best skyscraper in the world. But as time went on, they started focusing on smaller and smaller buildings and some cities where they've got good volunteers out there they'll have a great coverage, whether it be Sao Paulo or Buenos Aires or whether they'll Tokyo. They don't have the current availability and comparable sale data we might have. They don't have the news, but it's a great – it's a great sort of grid for us to use to start to bring content to these markets. And it has tremendous branding benefits. So the first time next year, when a customer – a longtime customer in New York who actually has a cross border investments, turns on their CoStar terminal and can browse different city, beautiful buildings in different cities around the world. I think people are going to waste a bunch of time looking at buildings all over the world from their CoStar terminal. And I think it's a great branding event. I don't – when I look at a London broker, they often sort of look at CoStar as a London company or a Chicago broker often looks at CoStar is a Chicago company. I think this sort of expands their – our brand and has them view us a little bit more like a Bloomberg, a global player really moving away from what started life as an outsourcing function for these brokerage firms or owners to becoming more of a unique, completely different animal, hat's a vast global network of valuable commercial real estate data. So it's a teeny company but it's a fun one. It's exciting. It's got some great field researchers. We can't wait until we can travel and we can host these photographers for a global conference and we'll end up taking a number of these volunteers and hiring them and making them full-time photographer researchers and South Africa, or in Kyoto or in Sydney or in Moscow or in Bogota, wherever they might be.
Operator: Your next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey, good evening. Appreciate you taking the question. Andy, I liked the description of some of the customer characteristics – property characteristics in apartments. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about sort of how you'd frame up the, I don't know if there's an average or a template kind of customer, but when you talk about the average spend, especially in vigor customers, but also down market. Can you kind of frame-up how much more you think you can take, and then what the average revenue per property might look like by segment at maturity. It's a wallet share question.
Andy Florance: Sure. If I just take the – and I think that there's some noise in that one to four category, but it's a 100 unit plus category we're at $1,000-some per month per property. I think that as the value propositions of digital marketing continue to grow for these owners, I think that number can – there's room to grow there overall pretty significantly. I think that the – when you look at the five to 100, that the $500-some, that's an impressive amount initially. Those are often being sold by a relatively junior new people to the sales world for us in our mid-market group. So as they gain experience and as people become familiar with the value proposition of Apartments.com, I think that people bid for more exposure and drive some of those price points up in particular in the middle. It might move up closer to the thousand mark. And then at the lower end that number really quite impressive to me. This is our first year really focusing on that area and to add a sales team of about 30 folks focusing on the mid-market and the smaller properties and come up with 5,700 properties at $150 per month. And that number may be a little rough because they can extend, the time periods is a little flexible, but many of them usually lease their property up within the month, but then go a little bit further than that, but roughly $150 per month. If you think about it, the per unit cost is higher and higher as you get smaller. So the folks over a hundred units are getting a real bargain at a thousand and the folks the thousands of people beginning to buy from us from single-family homes and condos and townhouses, they're willing to pay a real premium at that $150 price point. That's probably 10 times the price point or more that a Greystar is paying for a hundred unit plus community. So, I think, we'll get – we've had five years of continued appreciation, our average price point in all these areas. I think that trend will continue as we continue to build out a stronger and stronger product offering. And then the thing that I'm very focused on, I hope you're listening to me Paige Forrest is we need to build a bigger boat because everyone wants to ride, so we need more salespeople, but we can do that. We can build that team out. It's a great ROI. It's real straightforward. And we have a great team to grow with.
Operator: Your next question will come from the…
Andy Florance: Paige Forrest is our Head of Sales for Apartments.com by the way.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: All right, thanks. Good afternoon. You're building out a dedicated sales force for LoopNet with 100 to 200 sales professionals. Can you discuss the timing of when the sales team will be built out by? How you plan to transition the sales process away from CoStar Suite sales? And what the implications are for margins?
Andy Florance: Sure. So - yes, so LoopNet's separate sales force. I believe we already have hired the first 15 to 20 people. We have also reassigned maybe five or six people already, 15 to 20 folks in that group. For the foreseeable future, the apartments – the CoStar sales team is doing a great job selling LoopNet. We'll continue to do so. They get the hang of it. They're doing a great job, but we just have so much opportunity in the LoopNet side and so much opportunity on the CoStar side. We really want to give folks the ability to focus on their core areas and make sure that all the good prospects are getting covered in any given year and that we are pursuing best practices on retaining and renewing those folks that do begin buying. So what we'll do is as we have both the CoStar team selling LoopNet and the new LoopNet team selling LoopNet, we will do cross commissioning, which means that if I'm the primary lead on an account and I'm a CoStar rep, when a LoopNet rep comes in and sells that account, I will get some referral commission and I get higher rates on my CoStar. So that everyone is on the same team. The more they're selling LoopNet in the market both the CoStar and the LoopNet people will get escalation in their commission rates. We do it, so that it's still a very high margin. I think that the ramp up period for CoStar has historically been six months. As we bring people in and if they focus on the more entry-level LoopNet buyers that ramp up period is typically two months. And then as they go to higher end properties that might be six months. So I don't think there's a huge sag as we invest in bringing these people on board. I think they'll get productive pretty quickly. So, ultimately, our fixed costs are really the research, the software and we're in the margin as you add these sales people, they are incredibly high margin incremental adds after the first six months of onboarding. So, I think, it will just allow us to accelerate revenue growth, and I think it will enhance margin and allow us to invest more in the product while maintaining a high margin over time. And the one thing that's just obvious to me is that the market opportunity is just larger than our current sales force. And our current sales force is doing a great job on a one by one basis. These folks are productive. They're selling, but they're profitable, but we just need more resources and we'll be doing that over the next year or so. So one of the things I've done with all of our sales forces is I've asked them to give me a five-year plan and a one-year plan as to how many sales people they think they need to base that on how many high quality prospects we have, what's best practice for keeping contact with those high quality prospects, and then the customers we have in each of these sales areas and what is best practice on onboarding and ongoing maintenance a relationship with those folks. And so, it's just sort of a mechanical calculation. We'll have a one-year goal for staffing gains and a five-year goal for staffing gains. So that's where we are.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi, thanks. On the multi-family side with solid levels of supply hitting the market recently, and over the next year, and with some forecasting vacancy rates to trend higher including I believe the forecast from your research group. What could that mean in terms of the ad sales environment for Apartments.com and any other multifamily marketplaces next year? Could it become an even more favorable environment than what you've seen this year as owners try to compete for tenants and to fill vacant units?
Andy Florance: Yes. So, historically, the conventional wisdom has been, and then the empirical experience this year is that the higher the vacancy rate goes the greater the demand for lead generation with an online marketplace like Appartments.com. So we'd heard when operating Apartments.com for the last five years prior to the pandemic, we'd heard that when the market goes south and the vacancy rates rise, demand goes up for these ads and then the pandemic hit. And in fact that's what we observed. If we do get a continued secular shift to housing and obvious, you know, new home construction now is through the roof, lumber prices are through the roof, numbers are huge. There could be more competition for renters and that would bode very well for Apartments.com. I was on the phone with a friend last night, who is looking at running out their New York City flat, and they're having a tough time. And I sold my lifelong friend $159 ad. That's how good a friend I am.
Scott Wheeler: Always there to help.
Andy Florance: Yes, always there to help. And I know you can't use my pickup truck to move. I'm sorry.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of David Chu of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Chu: Thanks. So can you just discuss the LoopNet marketing plan? So it sounded like maybe about $15 million to $20 million in '20 or the fourth quarter? Just how much should we think about incremental in 2021? I am just wondering if this is going to be something large similar to apartments.
Andy Florance: Do you want to talk about it?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Yes, so what we saw – obviously as we got into the third quarter and the strong response with LoopNet that both from a paid traffic and a retargeting, we found that that was generating great leads and really helping our sales teams who want to grow and grow the revenue. So to keep it in perspective obviously, the apartments business is a direct to consumer business, which you have to cover an awful broad territory in your marketing scope to generate the consumer traffic that we need. When we talk about advertising for LoopNet, it's going to be towards – the owners and the brokers involved in property transactions. So it's a much more direct approach and it's not as broad as the consumer side. So fundamentally, it's not going to be as large as apartments. Now, when you look at our overall spending marketing, apartments is 80% of what we spend every year, LoopNet is only about 10%. And so, when we ratchet LoopNet up by three or four more percentage points of that in the second half of the year, it's not a whole big number. So, if you analyze what we're spending in the second half of this year, you might get another $10 million to $15 million of marketing spend next year for LoopNet. So, now that our marketing budgets are as significant as they are, that's not a whole lot, but we haven't set our plans for 2021 yet. We'll still be working on those for the rest of the fourth quarter. And as the marketplace for LoopNet continues to perform, we build that sales force then we'll definitely want to give them the marketing support they need, but the growth will pay for all of this very easily in LoopNet just like it has for Apartments.com.
David Chu: Great.
Andy Florance: So it is increased investment in SEM. We're having great success with our retargeting initiatives for both LoopNet and for Ten-X that is giving – providing real value to our diamond, platinum advertisers great results. The fact that we know who's in market – uniquely know who's in market searching for office space or investments or industrial or retail once we discover who's in market, we can dramatically drive the frequency with retargeting and that's working well. So we want to continue that. And then also since we have a good sense of who's in market to invest in properties with Ten-X we're investing in increasing the retargeting there that the metrics are great on the results we're getting there. And then we want to do general branding to elevate the image of LoopNet from what had in the distant past than more of a Craigslist for commercial real estate to more of a higher end marketing platform like Apartments.com. So we will invest, but we're investing at a lower level on Apartments.com, significantly lower levels of Apartments.com, but with a view to the fact that we can achieve the same sort of revenue numbers in LoopNet as we can in Apartments.com.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good evening. With the build-out of the dedicated LoopNet sales team wanted to ask about the plans for, I guess, the suite sales team capacity and prioritization. So just first, are you planning to maintain or grow that capacity instead of reallocated? And then just from a timing perspective, given I guess some CRE end market challenges, is this just that the size of the opportunity with banks, lenders, investors, owners, et cetera is so big and kind of those cool new CRE analytics you have in the development pipeline, but just if you could address just first the reallocation or growth in capacity, and second the timing of when you're doing it. Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yes. So we're – the opportunity for the CoStar team. So we've seen them going more and more into selling LoopNet in the last quarter or two, which is great news. I mean, that's giving us great results on LoopNet, gave us our best sales quarter ever LoopNet, but that means there's just not enough people left to sell to banks, owners, all the different folks, corporations who are buying CoStar. And as I look forward to 2021, and we've got a very robust rich product pipeline that is transformative, we got to make sure we have a sales team ready to carry that out to all the opportunities we've got. So, we'll be pacing in 10, 15 new hires, something in that neighborhood each month going into the LoopNet side, we might be doing a little bit of growth in the CoStar side. And so just incrementally as we an inward setting up the commission structure, so that the CoStar sales person benefits by making the introduction for a LoopNet person to do the work and selling into one of their accounts, freeing them up to go sell something else, but still being able to make money by selling LoopNet into their – facilitating to sell LoopNet into their accounts. So it will be an intense or ramp up of both sales forces as we free up capacity in CoStar over the next 12 months, but it will probably be a growth rate of about two years, most of the growth is in the LoopNet side, but that's freeing up resources in the CoStar side and there will be some growth in the CoStar side because just we can see we're unable to reach and prospect all the good targets we've got on either CoStar or LoopNet. I hope that answers the question, but the overall message is we've got a good prospect, we're investing into high margin and we have a huge market opportunity and we're kind of bullish and we want to grow.
Jeff Meuler: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Joe Goodwin of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Joe Goodwin: Thank you for taking the question. Just a quick one on Ten-X. How does it perform in the quarter from a revenue standpoint? Did it beat expectations? And then as far as what that asset will contribute for the remainder of 2020, is that still in line with what you previously provided? Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, we're pretty much in line with what we talked about last quarter. I think we said $25 million to $30 million contribution for the year. We're still right in that range. And it seems to be doing just as expected. Our focus on Ten-X right now is integrating the platforms, is connecting to the LoopNet Diamond ads that Andy talked about. And really until we get the platforms connected some time into 2021, we don't expect Ten-X to perform really any differently than where it is today. Even though they will have more interests, but until we can start elevating both the supply and demand side with that backend put together. We expect it to be about where it is until two things. We see the integration and then we see the advent of the distressed properties start to come through, which we expect really later next year.
Scott Wheeler: And I would add another element to that. So, we're clearly in the under construction phase with Ten-X. And as Scott says, optimizing the eyeballs to bring more bidders, we want to bring more demand to that market, so when someone puts an asset up there, there is a robust set of bidders. So in each auction, I'm watching carefully to see how many registered bidders, how many people actually bid on each property, and I'm – and this is not a monetary event. This is more of a tuning it to make sure we're bringing the demand to the marketplace. And we're getting fantastic results there. So the number of bidders is going up. The sell-through rate is going up. And as you do that – and then also, we're – yes, so as we do that, we're making good progress there. We're fine-tuning some of their go-to business strategy, go-to-market strategies like their pricing scheme, the way they're – like there was some – they were using traditional auction pricing, which I don't think is appropriate in a digital marketplace. We've been playing with their gross margins at different price levels and trying to optimize that a little bit. But the one thing that really stands out is that these numbers are great. I mean if we've got a process here that takes your success rate on selling a commercial property from 36% to 70 some percent, that's really – this can – that's discontinuous change. That's transformative. If you take a process from taking 500 days down to 90 days, that's discontinuous change. We have appraised values for all these CMBS properties, and we'll take that data set to write a white paper to show that the properties actually sells the same or more in a digital process than an offline process. Then you have – we can show that and establish that. We've got – you're achieving the same value, but you're doing it at a higher sell-through rate and you're doing it faster, dramatically reducing risk, everyone makes more money, all good. So you got a big winner. Ten-X was a relatively small company and it sort of sat in the shadow of Auction.com, the residential arm of that business. It's interesting Google had invested in Ten-X and Auction.com, and I'm told their primary interest was the commercial real estate marketplace side and I can see why. But recently, there hasn't been a lot of investment in that company, scaling it to its potential and they have a very, very small sales force to feed the supply side. We're tuning the demand side right now, but the supply side was underdeveloped, so effectively 10, 12 salespeople to try to reach hundreds of thousands of properties selling. So that means that 99% of the properties going to market never heard from a salesperson from Ten-X. And one of the cool things is we've got this very large research, marketing consulting group in Richmond, Virginia, that's constantly talking every month with all these people that happen to be selling buildings. So we're going to be training them on how to develop interest in using this digital platform, and that will be happening over the next month or so. And then we are ramping up that Ten-X sales force so that we can take those leads and pursue twice as many, 3, 5 times as many, 10 times as many prospects, and so a great team-up with research and a growing sales force. We've put a new leader into that sort of field, traditional CoStar field research for us for Ten-X, a gentleman named Brandon Lewe. And so that will feed the supply side. So we're doing all these things, not moving the dial for revenue this month or next month but getting us really optimistic about the potential going into the back half of 2021, 2022 and potentially change in the world.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Brett Huff of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon or evening Andy, Scott and Sarah. Hope you're all well.
Andy Florance: We are. Thank you. Likewise to you.
Brett Huff: Thanks. So a little bit bigger question because I'm having trouble trying to wrap my head around it and I've gotten some questions from clients. All the moratoria that are still in place and that may stay in place or however long they go for no apartment evictions, how do you all think about that both impacting the business today? Is it a negative demand driver today or positive? And then as those moratoria roll off presumably at some point, what is the impact on Apartments then? I don't understand how that good, bad and different or otherwise. So, thanks.
Andy Florance: Yes. So it puzzles me a little bit because I would have expected a higher default rate at this point for people paying their apartment right now. You saw the article. I think they're in the Wall Street Journal. It's definitely growing, and the consortium of folks who are collecting rents have shown that the number of people who are in default on the rent is growing. While there's a moratorium in effect that in theory is bad for Apartments.com because I can't move in a new tenant if there's a moratorium in eviction, in practice, what's happening is the landlords want to build that supply, so that the second they can evict someone who isn't paying their rent, they can bring a new renter in. And so in practice, short term, in moratorium where it's not impacting us negatively and then when it actually – when the system clears, that will probably create a lot of demand because you're going to have a lot of flow. Obviously, there is a terrible human cost here, but the question is more technical in the business. I did double check in preparation for the call today. I just checked with – we're handling hundreds of thousands of rent payments for individual, generally single family homes, and surprisingly that the rent payments there holding up remarkably well. So, so far no negative signals to our business in what I would have thought would have created a big negative signal, but when it clears, it's a positive signal.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to presenters for closing remarks.
Andy Florance: Thank you all for joining us for this third quarter earnings call, and we look forward to wrapping up the year and I guess a number of months from now, but we'll update you on our progress towards some of the goals we've talked about today. And I hope you all have a good evening, and stay safe. And great for us to be back together in the same conference room for earnings call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the CoStar Group's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today; Sarah Spray, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.

And with that I would like to turn over to our Founder and CEO Andy Florance. 
Andy Florance: Thank you, Sarah. Good evening and thank you for joining us today for CoStar's second quarter 2020 earnings call. A caveat, I see a large thunderstorm rolling into my position. So if I get disconnected, Scott Wheeler our CFO will pick up my script and deliver it not quite as well as I do, but he'll muddle through. So going into the second quarter it has been one of the most difficult to predict quarters in my decades of experience. It'd be hard to ever imagine the scale of dislocation our country is experiencing. Yet despite the challenges we face so far our team here at CoStar Group has performed exceptionally well turning in one of our strongest quarters ever. We grew revenue 16%, increased adjusted EBITDA 17% set a record sales month, raised $2.7 billion in equity and debt in the equity and debt markets and acquired Ten-X all while working 100% from remote locations. Traffic to our Apartments.com and LoopNet marketplaces rose to new record levels exceeding pre-pandemic levels. We had 62 million monthly unique visitors in our platforms in the second quarter an increase of 13% of our record traffic levels of 55 million monthly unique visitors reached in the first quarter of 2020. I hope you can agree with me that these results indicate that our business is not only resilient, but is in fact countercyclical. Our business like I believe most businesses was slowed in the first part of the quarter as people adjusted to the new normal. It has progressed back in each month this quarter eventually reaching our best sales results ever in June. CoStar, LoopNet, Apartments.com, LandsofAmerica, BizBuySell, Real Estate Manager, Risk Analytics and STR all showed positive growth in the month of June. In a world of social distancing our digital marketplace has uniquely enabled our clients to continue their mission-critical leasing efforts. While many were debating whether recovery would be V-shaped, CoStar Group's recovery to date looks more like a checkmark. While I believe the challenges from the pandemic are far from over, the progressive improvements in our operating results each month throughout the second quarter gives us greater confidence in the positive outlook for our business. CoStar Group's total revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $397 million. Across the second quarter our sales force brought in $35 million of net bookings with $22 million of that being in June alone. Our Marketplace businesses delivered strong revenue growth with Apartments.com growing 21% and LoopNet growing 18% year-over-year in the second quarter. Our net income was strong at $60 million. Our overall EBITDA was well ahead of expectations at $109 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. And our non-GAAP net income per share of $2.34 was up 5% well ahead of expectations regardless of the 2% dilution from our equity raise in May. Apartments.com was truly the countercyclical standout in Q2 hitting new records throughout the quarter. Net new sales were up 33% against our previous record set in the second quarter of 2019. In fact every single month this quarter our sales hit a new record high. In the true and accurate words of Paige Forrest our Head of Multifamily Sales every single benchmark was blown away. We had a series of all-time record high-traffic numbers for our Apartments network sites during the quarter including 23 million average monthly unique visitors, up 6% year-over-year, and 200 million visits, up 16% year-over-year according to ComScore. Our Apartments.com sales force logged a 58% increase in quality meetings and interactions with our clients, delivering critical service to our customers at a time of significant challenges for their business. Apartments hit a new quarterly record revenue of $146 million. This June the largest annual multi-family industry conference the National Apartment Association Conference was postponed due to the pandemic. This conference is a significant customer event for Apartments.com and typically makes June our best sales month of the year. Without the possibility of meeting in person we organized and produced a two-day virtual summer showcase event conducted entirely with video meetings. We lined up speakers from top tech, digital, media and advertising companies, along with our own research staff and economists to speak on a range of topics from local market updates to marketing in anxious times, all in support of our customers. The event was a resounding success. Over 3,200 customers participate resulting in connections to over 1,000 new customers. The customer response was tremendous and contributed to a record June in terms of net new sales, nearly 20% above the previous record and for less than 5% of the cost of the annual in-person event. We saved $4 million going digital. As announced last year, we've increased our marketing expense – and we've increased our marketing investment in Apartments.com by nearly 50%. We plan to continue our increased investment in marketing despite the pandemic, because we believe that we can still generate an outsized ROI on that investment even in this environment. Based upon our results this quarter, we think we are in fact seeing an excellent ROI on that increased investment. Our Q2 marketing campaign highlights start with the launch of our new broadcast ads featuring iconic Jeff Goldblum's as Brad Bellflower, the inventor of the Apartminternet. This ad hit the airwaves at the end of March with an increase of 12% more ads over our 2019 campaign, airing across an even wider variety of digital and streaming video platforms. This year, we also increased marketing via paid social and media and retargeting ads as well as addressable TV through personalized advertising based on household composition. We raised our SEM spend significantly leading to a higher frequency of number one positioning in a broad range of search terms. Overall, these paid initiatives led to a 57% increase in impressions. Paid advertising isn't the whole story either. Our continuous investment in the functionality of and content on our site, helped to continue to fuel organic site traffic growth of 16% in Q2. We were also rewarded by new highs in unaided brand awareness, an important measure of the reach and effectiveness of our campaigns. And we are now leading the pack with Zillow in second place and Craigslist and Rent.com tied for third. We believe that strong and improving levels of consumer awareness is the key to our ultimate success in penetrating the broader rental markets and the timing and magnitude of our investment is clearly paying off. The strength of our business is evident in that we can make these aggressive investments in growing Apartments.com, while still generating $109 million of EBITDA in the quarter. We were focused on accelerating our sales penetration across all categories of rentals from the largest apartment buildings, to midsize apartment communities, to single-family homes condos and townhouses. In late 2019, we added an inside sales team based in Richmond Virginia to focus on selling Apartments.com solutions to owners of midsized and smaller apartment buildings in single-family dwellings. Nine months into launch in this under 100-unit sales force we're seeing great results. This quarter, we grew our net new sales in the under 100-unit segment nearly 70% versus Q1 2020. Over the last 12 months half of all advertisers we added 2,400 properties were in the sub 100-unit category. While – when we acquired Apartments.com in 2014 little to no effort was made selling to apartment communities with under 100 units. Now 16% of Apartments.com revenue comes from properties with under 100 units, this means that today we have more revenue in the previously overlooked below 100-unit communities than Apartments.com had in total when we bought them. Clearly, there's demand for Apartments.com and rentals of all types big and small. But as much as we have sold, we are still less than 1% penetrated into the sub 100-unit segment. We are excited about the amazing multibillion-dollar scale of the opportunity we have here and plan to continue to build out the marketing efforts and sales teams to fully monetize our leading position. Some costs get behind us. On June 9th, the bankruptcy court signed off on RentPath Chapter 11 plan and our acquisition proposal as part of the plan, so the remaining hurdle is the FTC process. On April 29th, we received a second request as part of the FTC approval process for our proposed acquisition of RentPath. This was anticipated and we are responding quickly to the request. Should we get approval to close the transaction, it would be completed within a 3 to 12 month time frame that we gave in February. In the meantime, we continue to compete aggressively in the market as always. We believe that, we are continuing to take significant market share away from RentPath because we offer vastly superior traffic more exposure and thus more leads and leases Over this past quarter, we began integration of our successful lender Risk Analytics solutions in the CoStar Suite. Productizing these solutions into the larger platform will allow CoStar to expand its reach from the top-tier of CRE leaders to the many thousands of institutions that could greatly benefit from analytics-only available with CoStar data.  For over a decade, our highly experienced risk analytics team has been a trusted source to lenders providing credit risk models for portfolio stress testing and loan-loss reserves used in regulatory reporting, examinations and for internal risk management. By leveraging curated CoStar property data and market research, we can provide up-to-the-minute information on a lender's collateral allowing them to perform real-time performance surveillance. This is a capability unmatched in the industry. We think combining these time-proven models with CoStar data is a scalable -- in a scalable platform creates exceptional growth opportunity in the lending market.  LoopNet finished the quarter on a strong note overcoming the market disruption that began in March and April caused by the pandemic. Monthly unique visitors are now tracking over seven million which is an all-time high being the record set earlier this year. Net new sales improvement followed the improvement in traffic finishing June with net new sales up 91% year-over-year.  To keep this momentum going, we have really leaned in with significant product enhancements and marketing efforts. We positioned LoopNet Diamond and Platinum level signature ads to property owners as powerful digital marketing innovation that generates unprecedented and differentiated marketing reach frequency and branding for their valuable properties.  Beginning in April, we dramatically expanded our use of broad retargeting to further increase the frequency reach and brand enhancements at our top search advertisers enjoyed on LoopNet. With over seven million unique monthly visitors LoopNet is by far and away the most heavily traffic commercial real estate website, so we believe we have the best insights into who is currently in the market for commercial real estate. Once we identify a prospective tenant or buyer on LoopNet, we retarget them across the Internet thereby increasing the critical frequency of use for our top signature ads by 600% above the great performance they're already getting.  In addition to driving up the frequency of valuable exposure for our advertisers, this retargeting investment has a benefit bringing a significant number of LoopNet visitors back to LoopNet for further reengagement. In addition to retargeting, we have launched a new program to leverage our database of six million tenants and digitally target them across the web and social media to bring these tenants to our advertisers' properties digitally. We've also added video conference-enabled CoTour to LoopNet this quarter. This allows registered LoopNet users to invite colleagues to virtually tour potential spaces together.  At the end of June, we closed our first virtual M&A deal with our acquisition of Ten-X. Ten-X is the leading innovator of online commercial real estate auctions having completed more than $24 billion in property sales online. In the few weeks since we closed the deal, Ten-X has held two auctions transacting an aggregate value of $50 million. We have approximately $400 million in aggregate value going to online auction over the next two weeks. Ten-X has been used by all the major broker terms in America to transact properties online and close deals faster. While Ten-X is used to transact both performing and distressed properties it was borne out of the Great Recession and the need to liquidate a high-volume of distressed properties quickly. We believe that Ten-X is highly countercyclical. If there's an increase in distressed commercial properties in the cycle, we believe that Ten-X will see an increase in auctions and revenue.  We are starting to see tangible signs of financial distress in the commercial real estate market, the first being delinquencies which are clearly on the rise. This month 30-day delinquencies jumped five percentage points versus June 2019. This is only two percentage points lower than the peak of the Great Recession. And this time around delinquencies are driven primarily by retail and lodging.  In June of this year, we saw 7% of CMBS go 30 days delinquent which could translate into over 3% of CMBS defaulting over the next few months. You may remember that one of the key synergies of the Ten-X acquisition is that we can leverage our millions of LoopNet visitors and global CoStar users to increase awareness of properties going to auction to Ten-X and thereby dramatically increase the potential bidder pool for properties.  Auctions with three or more engaged bidders are much more likely to transact above the reserve than are auctions with just one or two bidders. More bidders drive more closed auctions which we believe will draw more properties for sale which in turn draws in more bidders. And all that generates more commissions for our brokers.  One of the first steps, we've taken is to move Ten-X auction candidates at the top of LoopNet and CoStar and present them as enhanced Diamond placements with enhanced retargeting which will dramatically increase their exposure to potential bidders. We will continue to invest in harvesting our unique data sets of millions of potential buyers and their search activities on our sites to digitally target them and draw these potential bidders to Ten-X. We're very excited about the enormous potential of this acquisition. This quarter the STR business model has clearly proven its resilience in what must sadly be the darkest days of the hospitality industry in modern times. Remarkably, STR generated positive net new sales in Q2 and a recovery in ad hoc revenues that was a positive surprise. In April of this year, 19% of hotels in the U.S. were closed. But by this month, only 7% were closed. Looking elsewhere, in April, 98% of Spanish hotels were closed, but in contrast today, only 3% of the hotels in China remain closed. Globally, the hotel industry is slowly recovering from the bottom, although more recently occupancy and demand have started to climb again in the U.S. But as long as hotels are open STR is essential with global occupancy rates in the mid-40s, 40% and little hope of a quick recovery business travel is very probable that we will see many hotels restructuring and changing hands. The lenders investors and new owners will also need STR data in order to accomplish those transactions. As you know, our strategy is to combine STR hospitality data with CoStar's complementary building set in order to create new products that provide a full view of building data income and occupancy information, sales comps and for-sale information. We're making good progress on this step and hope to have launched within the next year. We had two successful capital raising events in the quarter. In May, we issued $1.7 billion in equity. In June, two of the three rating agencies awarded our initial debt issue with an investment-grade rating wisely. As a result, we were able to issue $1 billion of 10-year debt with a coupon of 2.8% on July 1. Including our cash generation this quarter, this leaves us with a current cash balance of approximately $3.8 billion. This combined with our undrawn revolver of $750 million gives us over $4.5 billion of firepower and growing. As we move forward to grow this business aggressively, we're positioned with a phenomenal balance sheet and are well prepared to take advantage of what we expect could be significant opportunities in the coming years. I'm grateful for the confidence of our investors -- grateful for the confidence our investors have placed in us. Our investors are the 12th player in the CoStar football team and one of our company's greatest strengths. We have a long successful history of acquisition and integration having made over 30 acquisitions since CoStar was founded. A number of our great acquisitions have been made during down cycles. Examples include COMPS.COM which we purchased in 2000 at a 60% discount to the pre dot-com premium; and LoopNet, which we acquired in 2012 at a 40% discount to its pre-Great Recession premium. In total, acquisitions have provided about 30% of our revenue growth since our IPO, but it is how we integrate them and how they accelerate our organic growth that's more important. Taking the two examples of above COMPS.COM now brings in 8 times its acquisition level revenue and LoopNet 4 times. It's this kind of discount and development potential that we aim to exploit in the coming years and why we view market stress as an opportunity rather than a concern. Over 7,000 proptech companies have emerged over the past decade or so. Probably 500 or so have truly viable business models that are interesting that create plenty of future M&A opportunity for CoStar Group. CoStar Group is the largest proptech company with the strongest balance sheet and the most experienced and successful M&A. So we believe we are well positioned to make a number of accretive acquisitions in the proptech space in the years to come. We are very patient and have always waited for the right opportunity. Digital real estate consolidation is clearly a very hot space right now. I think the proof point is Bill Foley's, Cannae and Senator launching a $7 billion hostile takeover bid for CoreLogic in the midst of a global pandemic. I'm very familiar with CoreLogic, since decades ago as a young software engineer starting CoStar Group I invented the first ever version of their flagship digital public records product. Perhaps my first M&A success for our investors was declining an offer from CoreLogic's predecessor company to acquire the fledgling CoStar Group for $250,000 in our first year of operations. I had thought we were aggressive in acquiring Ten-X in a friendly deal during a lockdown. But I must say that even leaving aside the clear antitrust issues, Foley has one-upped us with the aggressiveness of seeking to operate a company acquired in a hostile takeover in the midst of a pandemic. Lastly, a few words on what we're seeing in the U.S. economy and commercial real estate. The rebound in the labor market that began in April was largely driven by workers coming off of furlough and reattaching to their previous jobs in restaurants and retail. However, as a second wave of infections is spread across areas of the South and Southwest, the momentum in job gains has predictably slowed as reopening plans were paused and reversed. The improvement in initial claims for unemployment has stalled at a level that is still more than double the worst single week during the Great Recession. Other high-frequency indicators and hiring seem to have slowed as well, so it seems that the initial V-shape recovery in the labor market is likely to pause. And with the emergency unemployment benefit set to expire in some form at the end of the week, the sharp bounce back in retail sales could also be at risk. Looking at the commercial real estate market, the lockdown has affected demand drivers for every property type in very different ways. None have been as negatively impacted as hospitality and retail. The retail sector has shown a sharp bifurcation in property performance and rent collections between tenants deemed essential and those labeled non-essential with the former nearly unaffected. The vast majority of rent forbearance and delinquencies during the lockdown have come from hospitality and retail. And we've seen a corresponding pickup in activity from clients in asset management and special servicing as well as from billions of dollars of opportunistic capital that have been raised in recent months. While certain parts of the industrial market have also been negatively impacted, the lockdown has accelerated positive trends for logistics. In fact once CoStar researchers capture all the leases signed in the month of June, it looks like it will be a record month for industrial leasing volume all-time record. For multi-family data from Apartments.com suggests that the spring leasing season was disrupted as you would expect. Asking rents are largely flat year-to-date instead of the gains that are typically seen during the warmer months of the year. We're seeing more noticeable moves lower in the rents of four and five-star properties in major metros in the CBs predominantly, but these are also metros where there are record high levels of new supply coming into the market. Given this increased competition on landlords looking to fill newly delivered space, it's no surprise that Apartments.com continues to experience record sales months. The office sector is perhaps the most talked about property type of them all, and its fate is certainly the most heavily debated in the media. April leasing volume predictably dropped as the transition to work-from-home began and people were more worried about getting a new router delivered to their home, office than looking at office space. That being said, April still saw nearly 15 million square feet of new leases signed. As we move through the quarter, the number have increased sharply as the new cycle shifted from breathless stories about the benefits of remote work to ones about its obvious pitfalls. There seems to be fewer stories today about companies moving toward full-time work-from-home and we're hearing more about hub-and-spoke office models where firms are looking to lease additional spaces closer to residential nodes from where their employees are commuting. Even if we have a successful vaccine full for immunity may be elusive and the realities of social distancing may be with us for years. In that context, I think it's highly likely that the amount of office space utilized at the workstation expands from a typical 36 square feet per workstation to a pi r squared or 3.4x6 squared or 113 square feet from 36 square feet to 136 -- 113 square feet. That could be a huge demand boost requiring tens of thousands of new office buildings albeit in shifting geographies. Uncertainty has permeate the capital markets landscape -- permeated the capital markets landscape, and we've seen a drop-off in deal volume, which registered at just over $46 billion in the second quarter of this year about 30% of where it trended in 2019 and 40% of what we've seen over the last five years. Yet the absence of deal flow isn't a reflection of serious -- commercial real estate's relevance waning rather that investors and lenders are finding it difficult to underwrite deals in this uncertain environment and that there's a pricing disconnect between buyers hoping for a steep discount and sellers holding on to pre-pandemic valuations. We expect that rising vacancy, slowing our negative rent growth and rising cap rates is likely to impair pricing and valuations by upwards of 10% relative to pre-COVID levels. These capital market trends illustrate the countercyclical nature of CoStar's business and its suite of products. During times of change in exogenous cyclicality, investors, owners, operators and lenders and tenants rely just as heavily on technology and data insights to inform their decisions and facilitate their deals operations and apartment searches on the Apartminternet. As we conclude our first quarter operating results in this terrible pandemic, I'm very grateful to all of my colleagues who continue to execute in our business at the highest levels of professionalism. My colleagues did not miss a beat and I have the greatest confidence in their ability to continue to deliver great results for our customers and investors whatever the challenges we face in the quarters ahead. Our services clearly remain mission-critical. Our online marketplaces are providing critical support to tens of thousands of clients maybe hundreds of thousands of clients who need our virtual leasing solutions to bridge them until we can return to the normalcy of an in-person property tour. This is a great quarter to be especially grateful to our great team, including you our investors the 12th player. At this call, having survived the thunderstorm without a power failure, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Well done. Thank you Andy. Move to that quite quickly to avoid the storm. Glad I didn't have to pick it up and read it, never quite the same coming from me. So, yes, I'm also encouraged by our second quarter results and we've seen great improvements in each month of this quarter since the pandemic disruption began back in March and April. Our revenues in the second quarter of 2020 increased 16% over the second quarter of 2019, coming in above our 13% revenue growth guidance for the second quarter and $5 million above the high end of our revenue guidance range. Revenue growth in the second quarter excluding STR was 12% year-over-year. We did not record any revenue from the Ten-X acquisition in the second quarter. CoStar Suite revenue grew 8% in the second quarter of 2020 versus the second quarter of 2019 coming in at the high end of our guidance range. CoStar Suite sales had a low point in April and improved throughout the quarter with June sales for CoStar coming in at the strongest month of the quarter, resulting in positive net sales bookings for CoStar in the second quarter. This is certainly encouraging when you compare it to the 2008 or 2009 recession when net sales bookings for CoStar were negative for four consecutive quarters. We certainly didn't see that trend materializing in the second quarter. As the lower subscription sales levels this past quarter start to impact the second half revenue, the revenue growth rates for CoStar are expected to be sequentially lower for the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Accordingly, we now expect the revenue growth rates for CoStar Suite to be in 6% to 7% range for the full year of 2020. At this time, we don't have any renewal price increases assumed in our full year outlook. Revenue in Information Services grew 47% year-over-year in the second quarter to $31 million coming in above the high-end of our guidance range. Overall, we expect reported revenue from Information Services to grow at a rate of approximately 45% on a year-over-year basis in 2020 with STR contributing revenue in the range of $52 million to $54 million for the year. Multifamily revenue growth for the second quarter was outstanding, improving to 21% over the second quarter of 2019. As Andy mentioned, we had record sales in multifamily in the second quarter, driven by an increase in the number of properties advertising with us, which went up 10% in the second quarter, as well as growth in the average revenue per property, which increased 11% in the second quarter as properties continue to upgrade to increase our exposure. Based on continuing strong sales, we expect revenue growth of approximately 21% for the full year of 2020. Commercial property and land revenue grew 13% year-over-year in the second quarter exceeding the high end of our guidance range. The LoopNet marketplace grew 18% year-over-year in the second quarter as sales results improved each month following a low point in March and April very similar to CoStar. With LoopNet traffic now above pre-pandemic levels and the increased exposure that our signature ads are producing for our customers, we expect sales and revenue to improve sequentially in the second half of this year and thus perform more or like to the apartments' marketplace. For the full year, we expect organic growth for commercial property and land of approximately 13%. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we will be including Ten-X revenue in the commercial property and land category alongside LoopNet. Including forecasted revenue in the range of $25 million to $30 million in the second half of 2020 for Ten-X, we expect that the commercial property and land revenue growth rate will be approximately 25% to 28% for the full year of 2020. Our gross margins came in at 81% in the second quarter, exceeding our forecast of 80%. We now expect gross margins of 81% to continue for the remainder of the year. Our profitability was strong in the second quarter with net income adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS results all ahead of the guidance that we issued in April. Our second quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $129 million represents a 17% increase, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $110 million in the second quarter of 2019. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $16 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Approximately half of the favorable profit outcome was from higher revenues in the quarter, the other half was from holding overall spend levels in line with the first quarter of 2020. Our marketing costs increased seasonally in the second quarter, although less than expected given some of the disruptions in April. Our hiring restrictions continue throughout the second quarter resulting in modest headcount declines as attrition continues at slow paces and resulting in lower personnel costs. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% is 350 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and it's in line with the margin we achieved in the second quarter of 2019. Now, let's take a look at the performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the second quarter our sales force totaled approximately 860 people including approximately 60 salespeople from STR and Ten-X, which we included for the first time in our reporting. Excluding STR and Ten-X our sales force totaled approximately 800 people, which is in line with the sales headcount we had at the end of the first quarter of 2020. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the second quarter of 2020 was 89%, down approximately 100 basis points from the first quarter of 2020, which was a better result than the 200 basis point decline that we expected when we gave you our outlook last quarter. Our current forecast for renewal rate anticipates an additional decline of approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter with stabilization and gradual recovery expected thereafter. This is indeed a positive trend and testament to the value our customers place on our information. In the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, our renewal rates declined approximately 800 basis points before recovering. We're not seeing anything near that type of a recession impact in this downturn. Renewal rates for the quarters for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 95%, in line with the renewal rate of 95% in the first quarter of 2020. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 82% of our revenue in the second quarter of 2020, slightly below the 83% from the first quarter of 2020. Now, on to our outlook. We are reinstating revenue and earnings guidance for the remainder of 2020 given the stabilization and improvement in our sales and the operating results over the last 90 days. Although there's still potential for continued economic disruptions in the months ahead, we believe we can forecast the remainder of 2020 within a reasonable range of outcomes given the relative predictability of our subscription revenue model. We currently expect revenue for the full year in a range of $1.63 billion to $1.64 billion, which represents a growth rate of 17% at the midpoint of the range compared to 2019. This estimate includes approximately $25 million to $30 million in revenue from Ten-X in the second half of the year. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2020 in the range of $415 million to $420 million, representing topline growth of around 18% at the midpoint compared to the third quarter of 2019. This estimate includes approximately $12 million to $13 million in revenue from Ten-X. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $515 million to $525 million, which is within $5 million of the previous full year guidance range of $520 million to $530 million that we provided back in February of this year prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current forecast assumes roughly breakeven adjusted EBITDA for Ten-X in the second half of the year. Our outlook for the year currently includes year-over-year increase in our marketing spend of approximately $80 million, which is a significant increase year-over-year although lower than the full year estimate we provided to you back in February. Again we discussed our marketing efforts are focused on the most effective digital and broadcast marketing channels for both apartments.com and LoopNet and they're proving to be very effective. Our marketing spend in these channels was briefly disrupted in early March and April, but has since returned to the spend levels that we anticipated in our original plans. On the other hand, there are certain marketing activities from our original 2020 plans such as in-person industry conferences, direct-to-mail, advertising major sports events. These are no longer possible nor effective and so they're not included in our outlook for the remainder of this year. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $120 million to $125 million. We expect marketing costs to increase sequentially in the third quarter as we continue to build momentum on the heels of our strong second quarter marketplace performances. We now expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $9.22 to $9.42 a share based on 38.3 million weighted average shares. This estimate includes the impact of the recently completed equity and debt offerings. For the equity offering in May, we issued 2.6 million additional shares. The additional shares dilute our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.06 for the second quarter and approximately $0.38 for the full year, which is an approximate 4% dilution which is lower than any of our previous follow-on equity raises. With regard to the debt offering which closed July 1st, the net interest impact of the new notes after the pay down of the revolver is expected to be approximately $7 million or $0.14 in non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year that's incremental for the interest on the revolver. For the third quarter of 2020, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $2 to $2.10 based on 39.4 million shares. So, I'd like to make a few comments about our balance sheet and our capital structure before we open up the call for questions. Over the past 90 days, we raised approximately $2.7 billion consisting of our follow-on equity offering of $1.7 billion in May and our first public debt offering of $1 billion in June, which closed July 1st. In addition we renewed our revolving credit agreement for additional five-year term at $750 million. We converted it to an unsecured structure. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever. We now have approximately $3.8 billion in cash, $1 billion of structured debt, and an undrawn revolver. We're in a very strong position to take advantage of both organic and acquisition growth opportunities that might present themselves in the months and years ahead. We have a strong track record of successful value-creating acquisitions, which is why I believe investors are confident in our ability to effectively deploy acquisition capital in the future. Over the past 10 years we've used a balanced approach to fund almost $3 billion of acquisition deploying operating cash equity and debt in roughly equal amounts. In just the past year, we have committed approximately $1.2 billion for three strategic acquisitions; STR, Ten-X, and RentPath. If we can continue executing our acquisition strategy at this pace, it would take us approximately three years to deploy our current cash reserves. In summary, we had a very eventful second quarter. We adjusted to a new way of working; we continue to support our customers, protect our employees, deliver very strong financial results, complete our first remote acquisition, and raised $2.7 billion, and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. I can't wait to see what we're going to do next. Thank you for your continued support. I look forward to updating you all on our progress in October. With that, we will now open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citibank. Your line is open.
Peter Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for letting me take – ask a question here. Good trends and congrats on the recent capital raises. I have a question.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Pete.
Peter Christiansen: You’re welcome. As the health crisis has kind of changed here and it's migrated to other states, do you believe that you can continue the bookings momentum that you saw in June into July? Have you seen similar trends there? Just curious, if you've seen changes in bookings activity with the health crisis changing.
Andy Florance: The trending seems to be similar to what it has been in the last three months. So it seems to be performing roughly the same. So we're not seeing much of a shift in any way.
Peter Christiansen: Thanks helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Chu from Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Chu: Hi. Thank you. So Andy why do you believe that renewal rates will be so much better in this recession versus the past recession? Is this a reflection of just lower CRE broker bankruptcies?
Andy Florance: I think it's a couple of things. I think one factor is that, in the Great Recession we had two super low-cost competitors. So we're competing against a very well-funded Xceligent back in the Great Recession. And approximately for every dollar they charged a customer they were spending $2 to $3 producing the product. So they were heavily subsidized. And they were charging probably -- they were probably charging 15%, 20% of what we charge for a service. So we saw people shifting down to the lower cost product. We also were competing against LoopNet at that time who is offering a product at 5% of the cost of our product. So those two things are no longer a factor. And I think that we've made good progress over the last 10 years or so, continue to improve the products, the line of the products, the news, more functionality, people are living in it more frequently. So unless someone is going out of business, which is certainly happening, we would anticipate more resiliency in this downturn than the last on the CoStar side. And then, the other areas, I think, are in fact countercyclical. I think we’re ready for the next question.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon.
Andy Florance: Hello, George.
George Tong: So CoStar Suite revenue growth decelerated in 2Q to 8% year-over-year. Can you elaborate on the broader sales environment for CoStar Suite including changes in the sales cycle and sales force productivity, as well as what impact do you expect the commercial real estate market to have on CoStar Suite?
Andy Florance: Yes. So I think that the big takeaway is that first month of the quarter April was just a stop, not much was happening. So that was a big factor. And then, it began to build back up and I think it will continue to build back up. Sales productivity began to return back to more normal levels, as we went into June it began to continue to improve. And one of the things -- one of the considerations is that, we have this -- the CoStar sales force is selling both LoopNet and CoStar. So you could get sales force productivity climbing, while you have one of those two products not climbing as quickly. So one could take from the other. So one of the things we'll be looking to do over the next year or so is, continue to invest at a modest level in building more resources to be able to go after both product areas simultaneously. But I think in my remarks I've addressed the fact that I think CoStar remains in strong demand throughout a cycle. Opportunistic, PE folks coming with billions -- hundreds of billions of dollars to invest and look for dislocation. People continue to renew leases. I fully expect that. And so people are going to still be looking to CoStar to understand where the values are, what transactions are possible. So I think we'll be optimistic about it. Also remember we're adding more and more to CoStar. So you'll be seeing Ten-X auctions in CoStar. You're going to be seeing STR data in CoStar. You're going to continue to see enhancement, you're going to see more lending solutions. So it's growing it's strong. We feel good about it.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone.
Andy Florance: Good evening, Bill.
Scott Wheeler: Hello, Bill.
Andy Florance: We’ve changed up on you. For 20 years we did these things in the morning, especially evening, it will take a lot of catch up.
Q – Bill Warmington: I appreciate your patience. So I had a question for you on signature ads. And it sounded like in some of your prepared remarks you talked about LoopNet recovering. I remember in the first quarter, it sounded like January and February had started really strong and then COVID had derailed things. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what the average price you're getting these days is and where you're getting traction within Diamond, Platinum, Gold and the Premium lister? And what the contract links look like? I think that it started out at three months now their moving north of six months. I was hoping to get a better picture of where signature ads are headed? 
A – Andy Florance: Yes. That's correct. They started three months, they've gone to six months and that's basically because we invest a fair amount upfront in bringing them up online and it takes more than three months to lease a $100 million building or to sell a large product like that. Scott, do you have specific numbers on the movement? I mean it's small, but... 
A – Scott Wheeler: Yes. Yes. As far as the signature ad pricing that you're talking about we continue to see upward lift in signature ad pricing as they're shifting into more high-value ads. I think the average price now in the signature ads blended across the different tiers is about $750 for those ads compared to the Premium Listers which are somewhere in the low to mid-60s per add. So we're overall blended around $70 to $75 bill on the ad with the mix. So we're still seeing good positive pricing generation and pricing momentum on the signature ads. 
A – Andy Florance: And Bill if we were to look out over the next five years, I actually feel that those -- that $700 price point could move into the thousands of dollars pretty comfortably. And I think we could take significantly more share into the signature ads up from the premium listing which would give us dramatic growth in the blended average price and do that with a satisfied customer base which we're feeling they're getting value. And I'm very bullish on the value we're delivering our advertisers. I think we're delivering amazing value on these folks right now. And I think that it's our job to communicate how much value we're bringing to them. So I think we'll have a good story there for five years plus. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tomasello from KBW. Your line is open.
Q – Ryan Tomasello: Hi. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to hone in on Apartments.com. It really seems like the current environment is a bit of a Goldilocks scenario for that business with the accelerated move to digital and some of the counter-cyclicality starting to play out. So I guess my question is if this backdrop is changing your strategic thinking if at all around the apartment business in terms of penetrating that TAM that you've talked about with products outside of just advertising, do you think that there is enough greenfield opportunity there to continue just to focus on the advertising product? Or is there also an opportunity more near-term to move beyond lead gen and more directly monetize other areas in leasing and payments and areas like that? 
A – Scott Wheeler: I think that the approach we're taking is first of all to be very clear, I think there is a massive amount of greenfield. So I am absolutely convinced that the area below 100 units is just as relevant as the area above 100 units. And it's just sort of an accident of history that it hasn't been monetized to-date. And so we have growth above 100 units and we have only penetrated 1% of the below 100 units. So we have 99% to go, so it's a massive opportunity. However, we -- it doesn't keep us from wanting to add more tools to improve the overall experience. And the margin as we invest in these tools and we can spread that across a large audience it won't really impact our margins. So we want to provide as much value as we possibly can to accelerate penetration. I think that the addition of this relatively small inside sales team in Richmond and the fact that they spun up and became productive working in new sectors so quickly is a lesson that we may want to invest in growing our sales force at a measured level because we -- the productivity per salesperson and the ROI per salesperson is great and the market is huge.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Q – Sterling Auty: Yes, thanks. 
A – Andy Florance: Good evening, Sterling.
Q – Sterling Auty: Good evening. And I am glad…
A – Andy Florance: I was worried as I got the 20th page, would be feedback.
Q – Sterling Auty: So you talked about the efficiencies in terms of the customer acquisition by doing digital marketing versus in-person. How do you think about as we move past and business travel opens up etcetera to whatever extent it does, how much did you have a learning experience that maybe you're going to be able to capture and even drive higher margins than what you may have thought six and nine months ago because of how effective this has been through this environment? 
A – Andy Florance: Well I think it's a really excellent question and there's a lot of truth laced in there. So there are a lot of things we do as we deploy people in different markets and the amount of business travel we do to reach our customers face-to-face. And we invest a lot in travel and move even within a city. And I think there's no substitute for face-to-face interaction with our customers over time. But we have seen 100 million people have now just learned what Zoom is and FaceTime and GoToMeeting and Webex. And so 100 million people who before were complete ludites are now well versed in digital and video communication. So our ability to train on board, support, grow our accounts very cost effectively I think is really enhanced. And that's a positive that's come out of this. But I do think there'll still be -- in return there'll still be a need for face-to-face, but dramatically less. So there's a little bit of margin benefit there a little -- probably a little bit of customer acquisition benefit there. Maybe a lot. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Cortellaci from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: It's John filling in for Mario. You have a lot of cash right now. Could you give us a sense for what a third leg to the business might look like? The Ten-X deal was interesting and that you haven't played that market before. What other types of businesses are you looking at, any specific criteria from a growth perspective or end market or product type? Thank you.
Andy Florance: Well I think one of the challenges would be careful not to say anything. So that's probably the hardest thing is not answering. So the -- there are a wealth of opportunities. And if you look at the things we've done in the past those are sort of indicative of what we might do in the future. So we're looking for things that have high overlap of strengths we already have. So where we look at their business and we think that there are things that we can bring into our business that will not incur incremental costs, but incur incremental value into our existing business and vice versa, so that we can bring things into their business. That we already have as part of our inventory and part of our sum costs and will add value to their business. That could be distribution channel, data, software marketing any number of things. So for example at Ten-X we can bring that into our operation and bring them massive exposure for their auctions which I think will dramatically improve their business. And it has relatively low-cost to us. So things like that. Now we're not going to straight terribly far from like there's no need to straight terribly far from where we've been in the past because there are literally hundreds of companies that are immediately adjacent to some area we're already in and they range from small to very, very large. So I think that the future is going to be more like the past. I know I've been waiting for the first phone call. We raised a first question on the call and thank you for delivering it. I talked about it, while we were raising the capital. I said we will complete this capital round and we'll be answering the question. But we'll be patient. The first earnings call we'll be answering the question what we can do with the money. We'll be patient and we'll be prepared to answer the question multiple times until we find the right deal. It may take 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 deals to make an impact. It may take 4 or 5 earnings calls. It may take 10 earnings calls. But we're looking for the right deal at the right value with low-risk and with us prepared to do the right integration execution. So that we'll be patient and it will be related and we'll have more than two or three thesis for why we think the deal will work. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thanks. Good evening. I was hoping you could expand on your comments about the data that you're using for digital outreach targeting and retargeting and LoopNet Signature. So you mentioned the tenant data, just if you could be more specific about how granular you get. And obviously you have a broad wealth of data throughout Suite. So would just love more detail on the data informing the targeting and the retargeting? 
Andy Florance: Sure. I think, I'd go into painful detail there, but just give you a couple of examples. So we could look at any particular cluster of buildings in the United States by property type and say office and Cici's Corner and then we can look at 15 years of leasing history and we can see what the most probable sources of a tenant are for any particular building. So we know that there's a high correlation between tenants in Tysons Corner that tend to lease in Tysons Corner, but also tenants in Boston tend to shift to Tysons Corner a little bit less going from Ruston to Tysons Corner. Shockingly some from the -- over to Tysons Corner. So we can look at those patterns and then we can -- we have a list of all of the tenants that are roughly in that quality zone for property in the source markets over history and then we have lists of emails and people associated with those tenants. And then we retarget those people aggressively. So, we funnel our spend for Tysons Corner building against the people who are most likely to come in. Now, we also know the lease expirations. We know when they moved into the space. We know, if they're growing, if they're contracting. So it's very, very targeted spend. Then when someone – when we see someone come from a particular organization to look at a property at Tysons Corner, we can look at other people that looked at that same property what other buildings they looked at. We use collaborative filtering and similar the way Amazon does to then invest in retargeting against people that either looked at the subject building to sync in frequency, or we may use a collaborative filtered property to bring in – bring someone from a building that just like that one and try to engage them in this other building. And that's also true with people that have – we look at buying patterns of what people are investing in. We're looking at what people are searching and looking at for Ten-X. So it's just an endless sort of big data exercise AI exercise of how we invest money against the right targets to very efficiently drive people. And that's working like a rock star right now. The – I'm very, very happy with the 600% increase in frequency, we've delivered to our Silver – our Diamond and Platinum advertisers in Lensa over the last quarter that is real value they're going to see and it really drives their brands on to their targets. So – and it's sort of fun to do. We have a bunch of folks that enjoy doing that, a couple of walks over here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Andy maybe you would like to expand a little bit on a question asked earlier at a more strategic level. I hear you talk about, for example, the sub 100-unit apartment market is being – you implied a $10 billion TAM. I think when you add up these marketplaces TAMs they are bigger you might argue how many times bigger than Suite but bigger than Suite, and clearly have these countercyclical even structural growth attributes in terms of the shift to digital. So I guess what I'm getting at is does there come a time or are we approaching a time where Suite, although it still grows is positioned more as the funding source for growth in these Marketplace businesses which are bigger and perhaps can sustain faster multiyear growth? I mean, would you articulate that kind of strategic change in CoStar's business?
Andy Florance: Well, I mean, I think you're – if you look at 5 to 10 years, I think there will be a lot of growth in these marketplaces. The – for sure. And I wouldn't be surprised, if they don't – if our source of revenue doesn't become more and more diversified between CRE marketplace, multifamily marketplace some – land marketplace BizBuySell marketplace and other marketplaces, we may enter. So I would not at all be surprised, if the marketplaces didn't eclipse the revenue from CoStar Suite as CoStar Suite grows. But I wouldn't count CoStar Suite out. There are many, many growth drivers for CoStar Suite. So we are well penetrated in the brokerage community, but we have a lot of green space, a lot of greenfield in the owner area in the lender area and in international growth. So we have some exciting stuff happening in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter. Third fourth quarter and first quarter, so in the third and fourth quarter, we're going to have a fully internationalized version of CoStar Suite many languages, so people can look at properties from Spain and in Spanish across multiple European countries and across the United States. And I think that just like the company experienced a surge of growth as we went from being in three or four U.S. cities to being a largely national footprint, I think we have that same opportunity internationally. And we'll be communicating some things over the months to come that I think will sort of reinforce that opportunity. And I think that, it will change the way that London Broker perceives us when their terminal isn't just showing the Mayfair information, but is showing them the whole civilized world in their terminal eventually, right? I think, it will change the perception and the value of the product and the reach, especially the owners and lenders investors and private equity funds. So there's a lot of growth there. Also, the tools that are going to productize our lender solutions to a much broader audience, I think are pretty exciting. So I think there are a lot of growth drivers there. I worry about one of the things that, I think is a stressor on the business right now is not the market. It's not the – it's just – it's the fact that our sales force over the last five or six years hasn't grown much. We have roughly the same size sales force – sales force, but it has CoStar and LoopNet now. It has the banking side. It has so many things going on. But I just think that maybe we need to grow that sales force a little bit to be able to capture all the different opportunities we've got.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Your line is open.
Brett Huff: Good evening guys. Thanks for taking the time. I appreciate it.
Andy Florance: Good evening.
Brett Huff: A quick question -- a follow-up on LoopNet, that a follow-up on LoopNet that was the business of yours that we struggled most and trying to figure out what would happen in this pandemic. Looking at history it was -- I think Andy you mentioned, it was hit harder than this time. My gut is that there's some demand compression, because people may just not be advertising as much in some instances bid-ask price or bid-ask spreads are wider. On the other hand, you have a much stronger shift to quote on digital advertising within the vertical that is commercial real estate. Can you talk about that trend and kind of the power of the down arrow and the up arrow? And where we're -- the fact that Scott said, revenue is going to get better in the next couple of quarters is really I think, indicative. But how do we think about the down and up arrows? And then, I'll ask again the question I asked last time, which I thought was helpful, if any change the microeconomic decision of a person thinking about advertising a building or lease. Has that changed at all gotten better or worse et cetera? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yeah. So LoopNet is, and I think the arrows overall go strongly towards countercyclical to LoopNet. And I think it's a trend you're going to see even after we come out of this particular cycle. So your comment about bid-ask spread is correct. People are not going to be doing as many transactions. But you can actually pick up that business over in the Ten-X side. So you'll pay us differently. But we'll monetize a transaction -- really the value we're delivering is the digital marketplace, but you're going to monetize it over on Ten-X. On the leasing side, I think you're a nut job right now, if you're not leasing your high-end -- marketing your high-end building on LoopNet. I mean, I think it's just beyond me, what you'd be thinking. So you have this $200 million building. No one wants to crowd in an elevator. And go up and down you're building with a bunch of people look at it. But you have the most people searching for office space on LoopNet right now or retail space, industrial space. And to not be front and center in front of that community and that buying audience in this environment is, just nutty. So I think it's more of an education thing. I think that, Apartments.com was -- it's an education thing. And it's a size of sales force thing. So Apartments.com had a much bigger sales force going into this cycle. And people were more -- it was more established and people were more used to digital marketing for apartments. So the combination of bigger sales force and the behavior allowed it to flex hard into countercyclical LoopNet, in the -- had predominantly been a lower end broker marketing solution was newer at the upper end property solution area. The office retail industrial industry was less experienced to digital marketing. We have smaller sales force there. So it's taking longer for it to flex into countercyclical. But we're going to be looking forward to do that. And truth is on our side. So, we'll work into that. And play into that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Kyle Peterson: Hey good evening. This is actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to drill down the STR business, it's a good sign it seems like the trends. And net new sales have actually been at least better than we were expecting given all the headwinds the travel industry is facing. Just wondering if you could just drill down a little bit more into, what drives these sales and eventually revenue growth, if it's not directly I guess related to things like occupancy?
Andy Florance: Yeah. So the -- one of the first thing that drives the positive sales result in the face of just astoundingly negative economic conditions, is the fact that no one -- people don't cancel their STR, because things are going poorly. So in a rough environment STR is your compass. When you're lost in the woods STR is your compass to try to find your way out. And you're paying -- you've got multimillion-dollar property or $100 million property and STR is costing you a couple of thousand dollars a year. So you don't -- when you discover you're lost in the woods that's not the time, you throw out your compass. So that's a critical fact. Secondly, the -- some independent owners this will be too much for them sustained low occupancy levels will break their ability to keep their properties. There's billions of dollars of capital looking to take advantage of that dislocation. And some of those folks are coming in and buying information and services from STR. So we're getting a little countercyclical going on there. We anticipate that, we will lose some of those independents. Bad debt is coming up a little bit some of the small independents. But there may well be significantly more revenue on the Ten-X side as we pick up that business in other forms elsewhere in our business. Longer term, I think we have a really straightforward opportunity to provide some real software value to the industry: lenders, investors, operators, REITs by integrating the STR content into CoStar. STR's technology magic for the first decade of its life were benchmarking and the ability to keep the data anonymized and secure and get people quality benchmarking. I think we'll retain that technical skill, but we're going to bring a new skill set, which is more processing power against the analytics more correlating data, expanding the breadth and depth of the different sorts of data sets we have from benchmarking to P&L benchmarking to forward casting to forward booking information, all that sort of stuff. So, product flow will probably drive a lot of growth in the future. They'll likely be -- we also going into the future intermediate term. STR did a really great job at selling into the hotels themselves. But there are so many other parties that are interested in the intelligence STR produces that a larger sales force a larger marketing operation will allow us to reach more untapped segments there. So, a bunch of drivers there. And I think all of us, our investors, our analysts and our staff are pleasantly surprised at the fact that STR has actually been so resilient in unprecedented economic headwind. So, hats off to the team at STR, Amanda Hite and Elizabeth and the whole team hold things together marching on in a tough environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Your line is open.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi. Thanks. Wanted to ask for some more detail on bookings trends, so how much of bookings activity in June was potentially a catch-up of activity from prior months? What could booking trends look like so far in July? And then, Andy, maybe what surprised you the most in terms of bookings activity overall since the pandemic began? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yeah. So, I never had a context for a pandemic. So, anything that surprised me like what is this. I'd say everything was a surprise. So, by far and away the biggest surprise was the mega empirical counter-cyclicality of Apartments.com. That was just amazing. And I don't think the selling activity is catch up. I think the management team Fred Saint, Paige Forrest, Patrick Dan did a great job of innovating. When NAA canceled their conference, our team put on their own conference, and sold a lot of product for little to no money invested. So, I don't think it was catch up. I think it's a new business they're winning. And I think there are just people in a world in which they can't put a sign spinner from their apartment building productively are buying digital instead. So, that's just a very positive trend. And I think that's going to go forward. I also think that one of the positive things that comes out of these bad situations is that people modify their behaviors going into one of these severe disruptions, but they don't modify them back. Very often that 30-unit community that never bought any solution from Apartments.com, starts buying it because of a particularly tough environment, but settles into it likes the results and stays with it for a while. I think the other thing that if I could say surprised me was the fact that I spent 30 years looking closely at employment data and this is the worst it's ever been by far. So I would have expected a much more severe down drop than we've actually experienced. So -- and to come into June with virtually every one of our product platforms growing is remarkable. That was a big surprise. Everything is growing. There's nothing -- I mean even STR is growing. And so the speed at which we came out of it -- and I think that I'm just going to -- we will definitely chalk up April permanently to just people saying what's going on. It's the buying a comfortable office chair for home and a router. That's what April 2020 was. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Goodwin from JMP Securities. Your line is open.
Joe Goodwin: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about how the pricing for Apartments.com changes when you're selling into the sub 100-unit segment? And perhaps maybe how your approach in that segment differs on pricing versus the north of 100-unit segment? Thank you.
Andy Florance: Yes, absolutely. So the price per unit comes way up. So actually the cost of marketing apartment -- a 10-unit apartment building in traditional methods versus the cost of marketing a 400-unit apartment building via traditional methods your cost per unit is much higher at the smaller properties. And on down to the -- if I take the cost per unit at a single-family dwelling that might be paying a real estate agent a month of rent which -- that's where you're getting your highest cost per unit. So our pricing sort of follows a little bit of that. So you're going to come down where you might be spending $700 $800 for a 130-unit community. For a mid-line ad you might that price may come down to several hundred dollars at the lower end. Also you may be in and out of the market at the single-family dwelling, so that may be a shorter contract period. But surprisingly, the pricing is actually not that dissimilar. What really happens is that people with the 200-unit community will go aggressively for the Diamond plus because they need higher lead flow, they've got more units to fill. So they might choose to up their exposure their sort and go up to $7,000 a month. Whereas the person with single-family dwelling can be quite happy with the results they get at $295 in a month -- or $295 for a campaign that might last for two months or three months. So it's not wildly dislocated. There's more money at the bottom than there is at the top in this industry I believe.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Andy, I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.
Andy Florance: Well thank you all for joining us on this call. We had a solid quarter despite the challenges. And again I want to thank the investors, the new investors who joined us. Thank you for your confidence and we're going to work deploying your capital responsibly in the best time frame possible. So thank you everyone for joining us.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Andy Florance: Thank you, Sarah. It's a unusual milestone that has a safe-harbor statement, avoid that the rest of my life. So good evening and thank you for joining us today for CoStar's first virtual first quarter 2020 earnings call or virtual full management team. The first quarter was really a composite quarter with two normal months and one pandemic month. As with every business the COVID-19 pandemic is upended normal operations. The pandemic operations in CoStar's -- the pandemic hit operation in CoStar's Beijing office first giving us advance warning and I am starting getting a bunch of beeps here if we use teams and beeps in my ears, so I am sorry. The pandemic hit operations in CoStar's Beijing office first giving us advance warning and some time to prepare to transition 100% of our North American and European operations to a digital dispersed remote workplace. Employee safety and continuity of operations for the sake of our investors, clients and our employees was our top priority. As systems teams responded promptly working around the clock to execute our emergency contingency at our plants, we're very grateful for the diligent efforts. We believe that 95% of CoStar's staff has successfully transitioned to working remotely over the past six weeks at 90% productivity. These are stressful and discerning times for our employees and I'm also grateful to them for their resilience and continued focus on our professional responsibilities and it's okay if our employees' kids periodically duck their heads in our many video conference calls. We're consistently keeping our customers and mission-critical needs front and center. At the same time, we continue to build and innovate for CoStar's and our client's future action this disruption subsides. We believe that our products remain mission-critical to the vast majority of our clients even as they deal with pandemic driven market disruptions. The commercial real estate industry will continue to operate and to do so will need to sign and renew leases, find investment opportunities, value properties, dispose off properties, analyze markets and very importantly market vacancies to generate much-needed revenue. In a time when people cannot readily visit properties in person, digital marketing becomes even more important. CoStar Group and our digital solutions are here to meet the industry's continuing need for high quality data and highly effective digital marketing. In immediacy of the initial phasing of our crisis, our clients are trying to assess what it all means and are trying to de-risk. This means buying new information or marketing solution sometimes is not their first priorities initially. The clients of our clients are also putting things on hold and that's disconcerting to our clients. As I've communicated consistently over the years in the initial phases of an economic disruption let alone a global pandemic, our gross sales drop and cancellations rise initially. We're seeing some of that now. I want to stress that our business has always been really resilient through down cycles. In the 2008 recession, which was very hard on the commercial real estate industry, that was the only time our revenue ever contracted or even a quarter and even then our revenue only dropped 1% in calendar 2009, 1%. We experienced a flat sales quarter followed by two quarters of declining sales, finishing with a slightly negative sales quarter after that cycle. Again revenue dropped 1% in the worst year in our 34-year history. Sadly in any economic cycle, some number of our client's businesses will fail. Some clients will exit the business for good, others will lose buildings to bankruptcy. We share their pain or deeply empathetic for any of our clients businesses to come in this downturn. We have often seen clients going through bankruptcy organization and continue to pay for our mission-critical services. As some building owners lose their buildings, these buildings remain viable assets through bankruptcy and new investors step in to buy them and many of those investors purchase our services as they begin to operate their new purchases. The fact remains in every past cycle, the majority of our customers continue to operate their business and continue to rely on our services. Typically, sales of properties slowed dramatically for several quarters to years, after a disruption like this. Fortunately, we're not as heavily impacted by the property investment sales cycle. Our broker clients tend to derive a lot more of their revenue from leasing commissions. In the cycle, leasing positives initially for quarter or so tends to rebound sharply like a sharp V. This is the -- this is for the simple fact that any given time the bulk of leasing activity is driven by leases expiring that need to be renewed. Lease expiration dates have no respect for an economic crisis and most companies remain in business and continue to need their facilities, so they signed leases even in a down cycle and as they sign those leases,, our clients earn commissions. I've asked our economists to use the wealth of information we have on past cycles and to run Monte Carlo simulations to estimate expected leasing activity over the next 12 months. We believe there will be close to a million leases signed in the next 12 months. We believe that these will generate more than $0.5 a trillion of leasing value and more than $20 billion in commissions. While leasing has initially ceased up, eventually is still a lot of business to be down in the back half of the year. This analysis refers to total leasing activity not growth and demand. We expect there will be a significant contraction of in demand overall but the commissions are not normally impacted other than normally impacted by that. Rates fall a little bit, then really hit the commissions too hard. In fact, with high leasing rise on some contraction or demand, there's something like a game of musical chairs for building owners going on. There is a lot of leasing activity but every kind of music stops, there are few owners without a critical tenant income or by analogy of chair. Marketing commercial space and apartments becomes even more important when it becomes harder when it's not met by the revenue in a shrinking pool of tenants. The pandemic and social distancing make this economic downturn harder than other downturns. The physical leasing process of perspective tenants driving by properties, being signed and touring for the buildings has in most cases ground to a halt. Just when owners desperately need to promote their buildings and toward tenants to fill growing vacancies, the physical inspection of properties is impractical. The digital marketing Apartments.com, LoopNet, Realla, Belbex, Lands of America or BizBuySell offer can become a critical replacement for the loss of the traditional physical leasing process. Perspective tenants can tour their options on apartments.com, see what the buildings look like. These aerial drone videos to understand the area. These matter ports to walk through the apartments virtually and even potentially use our online leasing tools to apply, sign a lease and pay the rent without ever exchanging stacks of paper with a stranger. Fortune 500 executives are touring potential new office space in a high-rise tower right now. I believe that it's much more likely they're in their PJs at home doing it on LoopNet rather than touring in person. It's much safer that way. I believe that this phenomenon is why apartments.com had it's second best sales month ever last month and in fact if you exclude the convention sales month like NAA, it was our best sales month ever last month. Even if this happened and we achieved that best sales month even after most of the country was locked down and our entire sales team was working from home. At this point in April, sales for apartments.com is facing ahead of April of 2019. To be clear, we expect the revenues overall may contract in the near-term, but we feel that there are a number of drivers that make our business resilient or even somewhat countercyclical over the course of next year. With 34 years of experience running a company that provides economic insights to multiple cycles, there's no doubt that this pandemic has created more uncertainty than any other scenario I've seen. The pandemic has created too much tragedy for too many. There is clear serious economic uncertainty. Good thinkers I respect hold diametrically opposed outlooks. So from where we stand today it's essentially unrealistic to predict with the certainty we need, what the detailed consequences of this pandemic will be on our business over the year to come. So we'll provide guidance for the next quarter, but not the full year. However, we continue to believe that our data analytics and marketing tools will be among the most valuable source of information, leads and potential traffic for our customers. Therefore, we remain very confident in our business model and the role we play supporting the CRE industry. We're maintaining our investments to strengthen our position from a brand as well as a product perspective and believe that we will exit the present uncertainty in a stronger position than before. With a qualifying prologue, I want to continue and quickly review our Q1 results. I'm very pleased that the first quarter we delivered at the high-end of our guidance range across the board. CoStar Group's total revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $390 million. Across all of our service lines our revenue growth was ahead of expectations with LoopNet revenue leading the pack at nearly 23% year-over-year growth. Apartments.com was strong with revenue growth just above 20%. In the context of significant investments we're making with apartments.com brand this quarter's net income was strong at $73 million. Adjusted EBITDA was solid at $124 million. During the course of the first quarter, our sales team generated $48 million in net new bookings despite the pandemic's disruptive impact. Again apartments.com was the true standout achieving its second-highest quarter ever of net new sales up 34% versus the prior year quarter. Paige Forrest and the whole multifamily team delivered an amazing, resilient and adaptive performance throughout the first quarter, they never missed a beat. LoopNet had an exceptional start to the year also, but the CRE industry slowed a little harder in March in reaction to the pandemic. Let's go into Apartments.com a little deeper. In 2019, we invested approximately $150 million to market Apartments.com to consumers. We continue to feel that Apartments.com represents a huge market opportunity for CoStar Group and we can achieve an outside return by increasing our investment in marketing -- in marketing Apartments.com to our previously committed level of $250 million in 2020. Our enhanced marketing campaign launched in March just as renters began quarantining at home and they consumed unprecedented amounts of media. The initial results from the first month of the campaign was strong with $1.5 billion impressions nearly double that last seen last year. The total visits to Apartments.com reached a new all-time high but unaided brand awareness also continues to climb with the new high of 35%. I believe Jeff Goldblum and RPA and the whole team did a fantastic job that they created and we're really happy with the whole series of ads we're going to be able to present to consumers over the course of the months that come. After a dip in March as quarantine efforts across America began, leads have recovered substantially and are now turning above the levels we saw at the same time last year, but without a doubt, our marketing investment is paying off and combined with the efforts of our sales force, we hope this will allow us to maintain good net new bookings levels. We continue to work diligently through all the required regulatory processes required before we can close on a acquisition of RentPath. The bankruptcy proceedings are filed in an expected course. In late March no auction was held because no qualified bidders came forward. From the public filings, we can see that the vast majority of the debt holders support the planned reorganization which includes the contemplated sale to CoStar. The SEC review is ongoing and we expect a second request, which will extend the review on a timeframe that is consistent with our previous estimates of 3 to 12 months from signing. As always, we respect the FTC process and will cooperate fully to provide the agency with all the information they need to perform their investigation. There is no additional information we can provide on the outlook for the process at this time. LoopNet started the year very dynamically continuing the positive usage of sales trends that we saw in the fourth quarter. As we and the rest of the country transition to home in early March, we experienced a drop off in daily average users that lasted for about a month. Over the past couple of weeks we've seen a steady increase in users just about back to last year's levels. More importantly, the number of searches now exceed last year's level and that's what counts for our customers. As I mentioned LoopNet sales dipped as is in March as people transition to work from home. LoopNet sales have not yet shown the same resilient that apartments sales are shown. I think one thing to remember is the digital advertising value proposition has been well understood for many years now in the multifamily industry, whereas we're in the early stages of adoption for the commercial real estate industry. Ultimately, we believe that the current situation will actually accelerate with net adoption, but it may take more time. I'm a huge believer that LoopNet will be an essential virtual solution for owners looking to win an outsized important share of the hundreds of billions in commercial leasing dollars they are likely to occur this year. Right now, industry participants really need to know what's going on. They need to have the best information available for forecast, availabilities, listings and the pricing information that CoStar provides. We remain committed to continuously improving our user experience and the utility of our CoStar product. For CoStar Suite in particular 2020 will be a year of significant product development initiatives. We're deeply engaged with the backend integration of the STR platform. As the year progresses, we plan to integrate STR into the CoStar product in the front as well. While CoStar operates in dozens of countries around the world, our product is not yet one seamlessly integrated, multilingual system, multi-localized system. While on the short-term, commercial property sales lines will fall dramatically and we expect will surge again in a year or so. Much of that investment activity will be multinational in order to provide the most value and catching the most value for that opportunity we want to provide our clients with a truly, CRE global transaction analysis and marketing platform. We're hard at work on that initiative and expect to release the first phase of our global system in the third quarter of 2020. We expect to support a dozen or so languages by the end of the year. Ultimately, a customer from one country will be able to use one platform to see, analyze and compare investments across multiple countries and cities. STR's clients are clearly one of two hardest hit segments of our client base in this pandemic. Payers definitely have had a hard time here. This downturn will be more damaging to them then 9/11 and the great recession combined. We expect STR will likely see the drop in revenue and profit but we expect the fallout to be relatively or comparatively mild. For our STR subscriptions, we've been able to handle about 8% of the client financial assistance requests through payment deferrals. For the other request, we've offered two to three month contract extensions that represent in total 300,000 in annual revenue. We also have 54,000 in annual canceled product subscriptions. At this point it's remarkable that it suggests less than 1% of canceled revenue. STR subscribers are our key partners and they're likely to cancel their products. These are hotel operators that know the data is vital to understand the market and what is happening with their competitors as well. They also want to make sure they have continuity in reporting they're able to track as soon as recovery is beginning in their market. The number of hotel closures in some markets especially outside the US we have a plan to continue to provide value to these subscribers even if we cannot report on market numbers for some period of time. We're providing custom analysis such as a deep dive on the average daily revenue declines that uncovered the fact that ADR declines were not from hotel slashing rates, but rather from a rapid shift in the mix of demand. The feedback from these clients are our exclusive content series developed for them has been overwhelmingly positive and underscores the importance and value of maintain their contract with STR. STR is the most risk associated with the ad hoc revenues. Ad hoc revenues are fast but we expect the revenue will begin recovering in June. This is revenue that will come back and the industry will begin recovery and development activity will restart, which will result in trend sales or if we ever prolonged downturn will be trend sales happening with distressed assets or portfolio evaluations or dispositions. We are releasing for the first time tomorrow monthly profit and loss analysis for US hotels. The data has continued to come even and even with so many hotels closed and there's even more desire from hotels to see this profit loss information. The entire industry is watching the recovery in China to hopefully shed light on what a recovery in their part of the world will look like. We've been reporting on China weekly and has now added a video series focused on China recovery that we're producing both in English and Chinese. As of last week, 90% of the hotels in China are open and we've a couple of markets that are inching towards 50% occupancy. Overall though occupancy in China is at 35% and that's certainly nowhere near the normal 70% to 75% occupancy we expect, but is well up from the low of 10% occupancy a few months ago; slow but measured recovery in a matter of months. I want to update you of the sale of commercial estate economy overall. It's really still too early to empirically see the full and ultimate impacts of the pandemic on the commercial real estate industry. The data so far shows an unprecedented collapse in economic activity, jobless claims over the past four weeks that exceeds $26 million and will likely be higher if it will not from the overall application websites and offices. Most high-frequency economic indicators are showing unprecedented declines from manufacturing output or traffic to retail sales consumer confidence. Incentives forecast a decline for a 4% decline in GDP in 2020 and the unemployment rate to approach 20% levels not seen since the great depression. We're already seeing the effects of the outbreak on commercial real estate. Continue in the hotel theme, hotel revenue per available room is down more than 80%. We're simply never reported figures like that. The immediate impact is less profound in the other property types though thankfully. Our daily apartment rent series shows that asking rents have fallen by about only one percentage since one percentage point since peaking on March 10. That's not much compared to what we’re seeing in hotels but normally we would expect apartment rents to be up about a percent over the same period, but all in all given everything there is no problem there, but we believe that many Americans are actively looking for new apartments as we've seen search activity of Apartments.com is succeeding pre-outbreak levels. In the commercial sectors, leasing volume over the past few weeks has fallen to about half of typical levels and we expect to fall further in May before it begins rising again in June or July. We expect the retail sector to be the hardest hit as many shops are closed due to social distancing measures. Demand for retail space is already turned negative so far this year. Many shops, restaurants, bars and coffee shops sadly may never reopen. Our forecasting models predict occupancy losses of as much as 300 million square feet and that vacancy rates could rise 350 basis points to levels well above the peak of the last downturn. Rent losses could reach 15% topping the 10% losses in 2009. Outcomes for office at this point look less severe as vacancies are lower and construction is about half the level in 2007. Still we expect occupancy losses ranging from 100 million square feet over four quarters to a quarter billion square feet over the next two years compared with just 57 million square feet over the seven quarters of the last downturn. Our models predict asking rent losses of 10% to 20% compared with 14% 2008. Declines in effective rents will be larger as landlords offer concessions in TI packages to retain tenants. Demand for industrial has held better thus far. First quarter leasing set an all-time record while the pace of leasing has slowed a bit in mid-March, Amazon has leased more than 6 million square feet in April alone. Can't help it, I need to point out that Amazon is one of the single heaviest users of LoopNet and we can see their staff working LoopNet at many of these properties they eventually lease. Need a commercial in there and the economic section to pay for the economics. Amazon has also announced that it has already hired 100,000 workers to cope with the demands and plans to hire 75,000 more but even industrial will see occupancy losses and rising vacancies. Demand falls even in our outside scenario. The positive absorption returns quickly and rent to resume trend growth by the middle of next year. With negative net absorption will likely suppress the losses last downturn the 2008 experience also gives us some confidence that leasing activity won't fall nearly as much. In 2008, total leasing line across commercial property types was down to 7% in the prerecession average and 2009 was down just 4% even as occupied space fell by more than 300 million square feet. By 2010 leasing was up 10% from pre-recession levels. The capital markets another effect on the up line but initial indicators suggest investment activity could be down by as much as 50% in the last downturn deal volume fell by 75% toward an unprecedented action that the Fed has shown the financial markets and thus far worse but we expect prices to fall by at least 10% and potentially by as much as 30% or more. In the most dire outcome prices will remain at the depressed levels in the next decade. Our baseline scenario though predicts commission start to improve next year while this prediction comes to pass, depends on containment of the outbreak and progress towards treatment and the vaccine, two variables that are almost impossible to predict and difficult to incorporate into economic models. What we can say with some certainty that many firms will fail, rents will fall and vacancies will rise but we also know that the day-to-day business of commercial real estate will continue as lease expire, tenants seek new space for our digital landlords negotiate, buyers refinance, lenders underwrite deals to determine value and opportunistic buyers come in strong looking for bargains and Americans continue to look for new apartments. CoStar Group is on a strong foundation as we face the full impact of this pandemic. With 19% year-over-year revenue growth $73 million of net income in the quarter and $1.9 billion in cash on the balance sheet, we had a great quarter in the overall context. Our staff has successfully transitioned to remote working. We believe that we will have a rich set of attractive acquisition opportunities ahead and we're currently exploring a number of such opportunities. We continue to support our client's mission-critical needs and we're hard at work building the innovative products that will drive our future growth. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler for the much more interesting and entertaining sections of the call.
Scott Wheeler: Well done and thank you, Andy. Certainly it was unbelievable start to this year in so many ways that unlike anything I've ever seen that's for sure, but I'm thankful that are CoStar teams are safe and productive, our business is performing well and week by week we'll continue to navigate through all of these changes. Financially, we're in a very strong position. We maintain a very conservative balance sheet precisely for times like this. The time when we can continue to invest for the future and take advantage of new opportunities that come our way. We have $1.9 billion in cash. Our subscription revenue model is resilient and the services we provide are 100% digital, perfect for time when person-to-person contact has been practically eliminated. Our business is much more diversified than it was in the '08, '09 recession with 50% of our revenue now coming from online marketplaces as opposed to almost 100% from CoStar 10 years ago. On top of that owners, property managers, institutional investors and lenders now represent our largest customer base whereas we're much more heavily concentrated in the brokerage customer sector during the last outturn. But things are changing over the past month and a half, we have financially become very, very granular. We watch daily metrics on contracts, on sales, on customer inquiries, customer retention, cash receipts, purchases and payments This information although valuable does not tell us what the future holds but it certainly provides insight from the multiple revenue scenarios we create in our financial models of which even absolute the worst-case scenarios do not indicate any concerns with regard to liquidity or the ability to continue generating strong positive operating cash flows. Now on to some color on the results. We had a great start to the year with revenue in the first quarter up 19% over the first quarter of last year while revenue growth in the first quarter excluding the STR acquisition was 15% year-over-year. CoStar Suite revenues grew 12% in the first quarter of 2020 versus first quarter of 2019 as expected. As a stay-at-home orders began in early March, we saw the daily sales in the new contract flow for CoStar decline dropping to roughly half of the January and February levels of the third week in March. Coming into the last week of April, sales levels have stabilized and have improved slightly. We expect renewal rates to gradually soften in the month ahead just as they did in the previous economic downturn. We discontinued all price increases in early March to our customers. Assuming these sales and renewal trends continue through May and June, we expect the revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite to be in the 7% to 8% range for the second quarter of 2020. Revenue in our information services grew 72% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020 to $32 million. This includes our first complete quarter of results for STR. On a combined basis STR and our real estate manager business represent approximately 80% of the revenue in information service. Also these businesses have reoccurring subscription revenue as well as one-time transaction or implementation fee revenue. The subscriptions revenues which were 80% of the revenue in the first quarter are stable, and as Andy said, will continue to be stable and actually growing both year-over-year and sequentially in the second quarter. This is encouraging as the global hospitality industry is certainly one of the hardest hit by these recent travel restrictions. Now the transaction implementation fee revenues have declined as customers delay purchases and plan implementations. Overall, we expect the reported revenue from information services to grow at a rate somewhere between 30% and 40% in the second quarter 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019. Multifamily revenue growth for Q1 remained really strong at 20% over the first quarter of 2019 which was exactly what we were expecting. Our revenue growth continues to be generated from both an increase in the number of properties that advertise with us which was up 9% in the quarter as well as growth in average rate per property, which increased 11% in the first quarter as customers upgraded to a higher level and packages. Despite the disruptive events that occurred in March multifamily had a phenomenal first quarter with their second highest ever quarterly bookings. Digital marketing has never been more critical than right now. So far in April we see continued strong sales level which is sustained through the second quarter would result in revenue growth of approximately 18% to 19% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019. Commercial property and land revenue grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020. Our LoopNet marketplace, which represents over 75% of the revenue in the sector, grew 23% year-over-year in the first quarter. Following very strong LoopNet sales in January and February, we saw sales volumes drop roughly in half consistent with what you saw in CoStar Suite and the second half of March and the remainder that level pretty much through this time in April. With LoopNet user traffic and lead volumes improving week to week, we're optimistic that these sales levels could improve in the months ahead. We expect commercial property and land revenue growth rate to be approximately 10% to 12% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to the second quarter of 2019. Our gross margin came in at 80% in the first quarter of 2020 in line with expectations and we expect our gross margins to continue at that level in the second quarter. Our profitability was strong in the first quarter with net income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS results all ahead of the guidance we issued in February. Overall spending levels came in the lower first quarter expectations as we rapidly adjusted to the business to respond to the stay-at-home orders and prepare for the anticipated negative affects in the economy. In summary our spending increased including cleaning and sanitation of our offices, the technology cost for moving to remote environments, we also increased our bad debt reserves to reflect anticipated economic hardships in certain customer segments, such as hospitality, retail and small brokerage shops. Our vacation accrual actually increased the time offers deferred by many of our employees. In other areas of course our spending decreased. This included travel, conferences, facility improvements, infrastructure related initiatives that are not mission-critical to support our customers and our products. We froze nonessential hiring and compensation in the beginning of March and we curtailed all discretionary spending. Our marketing spend increased year-over-year in the first quarter of 2020 by over $20 million as part of our previously announced multifamily growth strategy. It included higher levels of search marketing as well as the launch of our Apartments.com brand advertising campaign. This represented a significant increase over prior year spending levels and total marketing spend in the first quarter was just modestly lower than planned, primarily due to the timing of the spend as some of the expected advertising events such as the NCAA tournament were canceled. In addition, we pulled back on certain types of marketing that would not be effective when our customers are working from home such as direct mail or office visit gifts. As Andy mentioned, we intend to continue our increased investments in marketing as planned for the second quarter of 2020. Our digital marketplace tools are becoming more relevant and effective during social distancing, and now is not the time to pull back on marketing support for these investments. Cash and investment balances were approximately $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2020, up $857 million since the end of 2019. In March, we borrowed $745 million against our revolving credit line in order to prefund the expected RentPath acquisition and to increase cash reserves for other acquisition opportunities that could emerge in the near future. The remaining $120 million cash generated was due to strong cash from operations and other areas in the first quarter. Now I'll look at a few of our performance metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our sales force totaled approximately 800 people. That's up 45 people from the first quarter of 2019 and down approximately 40 people sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2019. As we stopped hiring in March, sales force attrition is not currently being replaced with new hires. The majority of the attrition in the first quarter relates to the inside sales roles. In addition, we shifted a number of our best field customer service people into direct selling roles, resulting in little impact to our direct field sales teams for CoStar and multifamily. These levels are roughly equivalent to the fourth quarter, which is the slight decline. The renewal rate on our annual contracts for the first quarter of 2020 was in line with the rate we achieved in the fourth quarter at 90%. The renewal rate for the quarter of customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 95%, also in line with the renewal rate in the fourth quarter. As a point of reference, during the last economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, renewal rates for CoStar declined gradually over the course of [indiscernible]. Similarly, we could see declines in our renewal rates in the months ahead assumes that our 12-month trailing renewal rate will decline around 200 basis points from the current levels. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 83% of our revenue in the first quarter, in line with the fourth quarter of last year. Now on to the outlook. And as indicated in our press release, and Andy mentioned, we're withdrawing full year guidance and we're not going to be issuing new annual guidance at this time. We expect to resume our practice of providing annual guidance at some point in the future. We are able to provide estimates for the second quarter of 2020 as our subscription revenue model provides a reasonable forecasting visibility for the near term. Our approach to the second quarter revenue outlook assumes that the overall sales results observed for the first three weeks of April continue relatively unchanged throughout the end of June. Accordingly, we expect revenue for the second quarter of 2020 in the range of $387 million to $392 million, representing top line growth of around 13% at the midpoint compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the second quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $110 million to $115 million. This outlook assumes we will seasonally increase second quarter marketing spend in Apartments and in LoopNet, which will partially be offset by reduced spend levels in personnel and other operating expenses when compared to the first quarter. For the second quarter of 2020, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $2.02 to $2.12 based on 36.8 million shares. In summary, we delivered very strong financial results in the first quarter of 2020 and our business is on a very solid financial footing. Our teams are safe and productive. And we believe our information analytics and online marketplaces will become increasingly valuable to our customers in the months and the years ahead. Thank you for all of your support, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in July. With that, we will now open up the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies.
Mario Cortellacci: I hope all of you and all your families are healthy and staying safe. I was just curious, because we have limited insight into how Apartments.com has performed during the last downturn, obviously, it wasn't part of your financials. Just wondering if you can give us a little more insight into how that business reacted. And I guess, I think the expectation is that it's more of a consumer-type of business so it would likely be more impacted. But any extra color or any more -- or background.
Andy Florance: Sure. I've asked Apartments.com or similar companies that we acquired in the last downturn and typically said that Apartments.com does better in a downturn than in a really healthy market. So higher vacancy rates mean there's more demand for leads and traffic into leasing offices and point of fact, many people, executives believe that a really healthy market like we had a year ago is a bad environment to operate Apartments.com. Consumer behavior here is fundamental. It's like having a roof over your head. So it's very resilient during a downturn.
Mario Cortellacci: Great. And then just more of a longer-term question. I think we've done a lot of questions around how the industry could structurally change on the commercial real estate side. I guess just the working from home environment, do you think that impacts demand for commercial real estate longer term? I think I heard you tossed out a number on just square footage of commercial real estate declining over the next two years. I didn't know if I heard that correctly or if maybe this has something to do with that. But do you think that this is a structural change in the industry that could happen longer term as more people work from home and there's just less demand for office space?
Andy Florance: Well, forgive me, I don't want to sound flippant of having these sorts of discussions. I come across a little bluntly. I was an early cynic on the context that co-working would take over the world. I may [indiscernible] to want to continue working from home. And I actually think that -- I think there is a little knee-jerk where people say, "Oh gosh, everyone's going to work from home." I'm not seeing that. And in fact, I could actually make the argument that the potential downside of 0.25 billion square feet of demand going away in the office sector is really just driven by job losses, 1 person per 200 feet. But the demand for office space is very elastic to the price. So the amount of space per person in Houston is dramatically larger than the amount of space per person. Prices fall 28%. Overall demand may go up, especially when companies are trying to figure out potentially over -- sale over each other and want to spread out a little bit. But our staff in Beijing is thrilled to be back in the office. And I've never seen people like that happier.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi.
Peter Christiansen: Andy, do you think this economic shock will -- will you think about changing any of your products or services, whether it be features or perhaps the way it's priced or packaged? Do you think CoStar will need to change any of its products because of this economic shock?
Andy Florance: Yes. Yes. We are -- our product teams have probably initiated a dozen or more product changes to deal with the situation. If you go to LoopNet, you'll see a very prominent virtual tour button now on a home page. We now have an ability in LoopNet, where a broker can -- or 2 executives, a broker and a tenant or 2 executives can join each other on a LoopNet tour and actually initiate videoconferencing together in the LoopNet website as they view properties. We call that co-tour. There are probably a dozen or so of these sort of virtual leasing, more social distancing type things that we're doing. And we're also ratcheting up the marketing. This is the -- one thing that happens in any one of these disruptions is typically behavior changes permanently. And so we believe that there's a chance that people will come to value online marketing and real estate much more than they valued it before, and we're basically pulling all the strings and product features to try to capture that as quickly as we can. There's some other initiatives we're looking at, and maybe 1 or 2 acquisitions we're looking at, that are responsive to what's occurring right now and what we think will happen next year. So we're -- I think probably 30% of what we're doing in product is around this situation right now. I don't think there's a lot changing in pricing. I think we never increased prices when the market is in disruption. But beyond that, I don't think there's a bunch of -- no big need to change pricing. Too long an answer there, I'm sorry.
Peter Christiansen: No. That's fine. And then have you seen any new use cases for CoStar products? Have there been new clients that have approached you? Interested if anything's popped up.
Andy Florance: It's a little early for that, but I'm positive there will be. What you typically see is money on the sidelines looking to move in on distressed properties. So that's already starting to ramp up as usual.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.
Stephen Sheldon: Andy, you made the comment that revenues could contract in the near term. So I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there. But generally, how much visibility do you have right now looking at potential revenue in the third and fourth quarters this year? Is there at least a meaningful likelihood that revenue in the second half of the year could be down organically? Or were you just saying that as a general possibility, but maybe not what we should expect at this point?
Andy Florance: I would reiterate that there's a lot of uncertainty right here. We don't know if we're going to be fully back at work, when, how, but I would not be at all surprised if there wasn't -- I would expect softness in revenue. I have to say that when I saw the Apartment sales numbers, see the sales numbers coming in this month, I'm shocked and like, "Oh my gosh, the world is falling apart and we're selling a lot of online marketing." But yes, I have to assume that some elements of our business, as with other downturns, we'll see softness. Cancellations will go up. We've had a number of customers ask for forbearance on their bills. We've probably negotiated some deferrals on about 160 customers in CoStar. We probably eliminated some user headcount at some sites, on 100 or 200 some sites [technical difficulty]. Yes, we have to change the long-term course. We would expect to pick back up if there's softness shortly thereafter. And we're going to be trying to -- we're going to try to keep everything move in the right direction. But we certainly can't say that it won't go negative here or there. But again, when it went negative last time, only one-time ever in 34 years. On annualized calendar basis, it was 1% down. So I'll take that. If that's the hit we're going to take, I'll take that. But we're going to try to fight it.
Stephen Sheldon: Okay. And then secondly, you'd mentioned the potential global system that you plan to roll out in the third quarter for the CoStar Suite. Any thoughts on what that could mean for the CoStar Suite financially as we think about the next few years?
Andy Florance: Yes. It's certainly not a pandemic-related investment. It's the long play. But you look at -- I think we -- when I look at the early days of CoStar, we were in a handful of cities. There was x demand for our products. As soon as we covered the majority of the United States, I felt that there was 4x the demand for our products because we were a way to transcend multiple markets and geographies in the United States. I believe that same opportunity exists on international level. Once we can start to stitch together our European point solutions into a consistent solution, along with the consistent solution in the United States and tie in some of our new assets in Asia into that same platform, I believe we'll be able to offer a lot more value. We will not be making massive investments in cycling up in Poland this year, obviously. But modest investments to start to build our network around the world. And we'll be doing things like if a customer subscribes to national data in the United States, they will automatically get global data. So someone in London will be able to search for sales opportunities in Toronto or in -- look at hotel information in Beijing, et cetera, etcetera. But we do think that we want to be well-positioned for what we think a drop in investment sale activity, multinational. And we want to really be able to build a -- really capture that global capital flow that's invested in commercial real estate. And it's making good progress. And we're lucky that our lead developer, Mike Fulkerson, there from -- my gosh, how could I possibly remember that #1 language software. What is it, Scott? If you're going to learn a new language?
Scott Wheeler: That is a good question. Maybe C+?
Andy Florance: Was that [indiscernible]. Thank you very much. Right. Okay. Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: That comes from our General Counsel. Perfect guy to have running CoStar development as the guy who led development over at Rosetta Stone.
Stephen Sheldon: Sounds good. Appreciate the color.
Andy Florance: We definitely have too many devices up on my screen on my desk. Now I have like Rosetta Stone popping up on 16 bubbles on 3 screens.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey: Appreciate you taking the question and all the color as usual. And Andy, I know it's a super fluid environment, and I'm just trying to especially on the second quarter guide, which is pretty good, all things considered. And some of the qualitative commentary -- again, just acknowledge surprisingly strong sales on multifamily LoopNet. So if you continue to do well, given the investments in LoopNet and given the countercyclical aspects of multifamily, should we infer that to the extent the numbers sort of get much worse comparable to the worst part to the '08-'09 downturn, that most of the downside risk exists in suite? And I just wonder about the mechanics of that?
Andy Florance: Yes. So we -- sadly, I really do expect to see a lot of bankruptcies. And I remember clearly in '08, you had thousands of companies that were clients going bankrupt. So I imagine you're going to see some bankruptcies, you're going to see folks at the end of their career decide to step out at this point. So you'll see that -- we'll see that hit the CoStar suite side, and that typically -- that will happen over X number of quarters, but you also see new buyers entering the market in the -- after a quarter or two, especially like vulture investors or opportunistic investors. You will see building owners go bankrupt. The only up -- silver lining there is that they tend to -- they have in the past, tended to maintain their marketing plans through bankruptcy. Bankruptcy courts tend to approve that because they don't want the revenue stream to erode during the bankruptcy process. And then the thing that I remember clearly from the last several cycles is that the new owners, $0.50 on the dollar, they are flushed with cash and much of it flows our way. So there are -- I think that there will be friction throughout the system, but probably a little bit more on the brokers who step out of the business to go -- or go bankrupt on the CoStar side.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Mayank Tandon with Needham.
Mayank Tandon: Andy or Scott, maybe one of you could answer this. In terms of the multifamily platform, I think, Scott, you mentioned that 11% of the growth last quarter came from some of the upgrades. Could you provide a little bit more color in terms of what those features are that the users are buying? And what does that mean for 2Q in terms of the contribution from the upgrade on the platform?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, sure. What I was referring to in the growth in the quarter was that the -- our clients are choosing higher level ad packages to purchase, which cost more per package. You may recall, last year, we announced that we were putting a Diamond Plus level for sorting to the top of the Diamond section. And then this last year, at the end of the fourth quarter, we also introduced Platinum and Gold Plus tiers as well to sort of to the top to those levels. Now those aren't material parts of our sales right now. But there's just examples of when people want to get more exposure when they have additional vacancies they need to fill, then they can buy up to higher level ad packages to get more traffic and more leads. And we saw that in the first quarter, and that's what generated that 11% revenue growth from that price/mix effect.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: So Signature Ads at LoopNet, that was a big focus of the sales conference in January. And the whole move from having LoopNet go from being a broker-focused, broker-driven to the owner-driven market, are you seeing uptake on those ads moving from the broker price point at $35, $40, $60 per listing per month up to the $2,000 to $3,000 level for the owners. Is that taking place? And is that going to continue to drive the revenue? Because it sounds like the revenue on that division is going from around 20%, 22% expected revenue growth, about 10% to 12% revenue growth?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, that's right.
Andy Florance: Yes. So before the pandemic hit, we saw some really good sales results in LoopNet Signature Ads. And then the pandemic hit and everything just basically stopped while people are figuring out what's going on. But the really good results of Signature Ads continues in January, February. And as much as anything, I think we saw some brokers who are more vulnerable pulling back some of their spending. And while it's -- there was a dip in search activity in LoopNet initially as we went into the pandemic in the United States, that activity has come back up and searches are now stronger than they were before. I think we need to clarify our message or evolve our message to the owners about the fact that they have -- the message is really solid for those folks. There will be hundreds of thousands to 1 million leases in the next year. There will be a contraction of overall demand. People are not driving by and seeing building signs, people not touring the buildings. We are continuously improving the immersive quality of marketing their buildings on LoopNet. And we think we will pick up revenue, and I think it will keep going. But we're being conservative right now because a lot of our revenue on LoopNet comes from small brokerage firms, and we think they will take an outside hit, but that's not really impacting the fact that we're going after a new market pretty aggressively, which is the larger institutional owners. And the amount of money they spend on an advertisement on a high-end movement ad relative to their vacancy loss is about as levered as you can possibly be. You're looking at a $100 million vacancy loss, and you're looking at an ad that costs a couple of thousand bucks. So I remain optimistic. I spent most of Sunday working on new marketing materials for LoopNet to try to adjust and focus, and I think we'll -- I'm still bullish about the potential there. But Mr. Wheeler, Dr. Wheeler, will be Dr. No [ph] because we're seeing the low and being conservative.
Scott Wheeler: And Bill, we talked about the revenue per listing increasing in Apartments as people buy ads. In just Signature Ads alone, we saw from the fourth quarter, we were around $500 per ad in the fourth quarter, now we're a little over $700 per ad in the first quarter. And that's not price increases. That's people deciding to buy the Platinum and the Diamond level Signature Ads in more and more quantities as time is going on and as our sales force is really focused on those high-value properties. So it's starting to move up nicely from an average price perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW.
Ryan Tomasello: Regarding the expense base, can you talk about what levers you have to pull there going into the back half of the year and how willing you'd be to pull them depending on how this all plays out over the next few quarters? And particularly with respect to the apartment ad spend, can you clarify your comments regarding the intent to continue with that plan? Is that just with respect to 1Q, meaning the ad spend in the second half of the year could potentially be curtailed depending on how the environment unfolds?
Andy Florance: We -- at this point, as we've mentioned, so there are a bunch of different levers we can pull on cost structure. We have a lot of optionality there, but don't have conditions that would merit contracting our spend dramatically. We actually have a lot of great growth drivers in the business and we are -- as we report this quarter, we're meeting our expectations. If things fell apart, certainly, we would react, but that's not what's going on. And when you look at the results we're having in Apartments.com, they're strong, and we believe that potential is still there. And we don't see a reason at this point to change our strategy. Our traffic to Apartments.com and our lead flow is at the highest level it's ever been. So across the board, almost all of our key sites are hitting the traffic numbers. And we think that there's a transition going on from more offline to more online. And this is an opportunity that we don't really want to change our course or our mission, given what the facts we have today. So we're anticipating continuing the same investment we originally planned unless something changes.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: You withdrew your full year 2020 guidance and only guiding 1 quarter out for now. Can you discuss your confidence level in achieving your previously disclosed 2023 targets?
Scott Wheeler: Those are always fun questions to ask, George, in the midst of an extremely uncertain environment. When we decided not to give 2020 guidance, George asks me for 2023 guidance. I kind of knew you were lurking out there, George. You can get to that. So right now, we -- like we said, we've gotten the second quarter is what we're seeing so far. And clearly, we are focused on growing back at our historic levels as quickly as possible and continue to invest so that can snap back, and continuing to pursue acquisitions, which will help fill any of those revenue gaps that might be created by a temporary slowdown. Certainly, you either have to buy more acquisitions or you're going to have to get that revenue growth rate running up further in the out years. But mathematically, we can still get there. Again, we didn't tell you know what the length and the duration of the downturn is. You can't say it for certain. But that's not all we know about it so far. And as pace and directions change, we'll obviously keep that in mind.
Andy Florance: The uncertainty, clearly, is high right now. And -- but the -- and we don't have a reason to believe that it's not achievable at this point until facts change and there's -- or reasonably it's not achievable. I would actually say you could say if an element of that is organic, it would probably be more achievable to -- I'm sorry, or an element of that target is acquisitive for an acquisition, that may become easier to achieve those targets in this acquisition environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys, and glad you're all well. Andy, I want to follow up a little bit with you because I know you've been probably talking with a lot of your customers, and we've gotten a lot of questions on kind of the microeconomic decisions that, say, a multifamily owner or a commercial building owner who wants to sell or maybe is under duress or maybe wants to wait. Do you have any anecdotes that will help us get some insight into those decisions that folks are making and how, therefore, they're going to make decisions on whether they'll advertise on LoopNet or advertise in multifamily? You gave us a good example of the large multifamily owner with lots of vacancy risks, buying an ad for a few thousand dollars. But are there any more in the middle market or even any more for LoopNet that you could give us?
Andy Florance: So in terms of -- I think there are two different questions there. One is the microeconomics and decision to market on LoopNet or Apartments.com. I think that math is really quite simple. Like if -- across the board, the economic trend is going to be just softness in leasing revenue. And when you hit softness in leasing revenues on big dollar items and traditional methods like broker parties or events or signs or people spinning the sign outside or walking through the building are all gone away, that beautiful print brochure is not going to be seen or touched by anybody. It's a no-brainer that the trend should be to digital marketing, virtual experiences, more Matterports, more drone videos and the like. That's a no-brainer. And on the other element about decisions, how people are using our tools to try to decide should they sell, should they -- I think those trends are tsunami-like. And I think that -- I hope our clients use our data aggressively and trust the numbers to set their pricing realistically quickly to win at the game of musical chairs, i.e., sit down first if the data says you should sit down first because having a chair is better than having no tenant at all. So I think that people should be using our data right now to really be realistic between -- and also to help coordinate between owner, lender and investor to make sure that they're all making that decision together with data as opposed to hope. And then on the part of investment sales, I feel that there's typically a big disconnect right now where it's going to be really difficult for people to -- sellers to reduce their expectations enough to meet where buyers are right now. So typically, that doesn't happen for a year to 18 months to 24 months. But we will build products and services to try to be there with strong offerings as that volume unleashes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: So for my one question, I just want to go back to multifamily in terms of the comments that you made. Is it fair to say that you actually believe the bottom has already been put in, in multifamily? Or is there a potential that multifamily could see sequential contraction in the upcoming quarters?
Andy Florance: I think there's two questions. One is our experience selling advertising to multifamily, and then secondly, rates and occupancy levels and asset prices in the multifamily world. I believe that just by the nature of our business, we are somewhat insulated as to what happens with occupancies. We may be inversely correlated to what happens with occupancies. I think we're relatively independent of what happens with the rent. The rent fall so far are not material. And I think we're independent of what happens to asset values. We may be somewhat negatively impacted by the fact there may not be a lot of new development over the next two years. But at this point, the sales are holding up strong because if you have tenants who are not paying rent and were paying rent the month before, and you anticipate they may not be paying rent again in the future, you need to begin to backfill them. If you just had a large property deliver and it's got a lot of vacancy, then you may have -- I need to really pick it up. So I don't -- again, we can't really see beyond next quarters to what's going to happen in the economy. But right now, we feel pretty good about what's happening from Apartments.com's perspective and our experience. It could change, but right now, it's -- it has surprised me materially to the upside. Shocked me.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Goodwin with JMP Securities.
Joe Goodwin: Just one quick on comment on the revenue -- potential revenue growth going negative. Can you maybe just give some color on how you're thinking...
Sarah Spray: Joe. Joe, I'm sorry. Could you speak up a little bit? It's very dim. Could you try again?
Joe Goodwin: Is that better?
Andy Florance: Yes, much better.
Joe Goodwin: Sorry about that. So on the commentary around the potential of your revenue actually going negative growth, could you maybe just give us some color around what quarter will likely be the bottom or at least how you're thinking about there?
Andy Florance: I would look at -- we don't know, but I would just look back to the worst we ever experienced in 30 years was '08, '09. And we had two quarters where it really materially fell. So that would be a quarter or two out on the CoStar side, but we -- this is a different cycle, and we have no idea when -- it's just too hard to predict past the quarter. But it typically wouldn't be -- if you were just taking exactly what happened in '08 and stick it right here, it would be third, fourth quarter.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. The other thing, people we're seeing -- and to keep in mind is that, if you recall back in the last recession, it started to build -- the negative momentum started to build through '08 and then dropped pretty heavily at the end of '08, early '09. And so it took a number of quarters for that to develop. What we're seeing happen here is things dropped quickly, and they dropped within a week down to the levels I mentioned, half of the levels of sales, et cetera, which never happened before in the '08, '09. And then when we see what's happened since then, as Andy mentioned, we've seen volumes move up in traffic and leads on both LoopNet and Apartments.com. Apartments.com is up where it was before the downturn. We've seen CoStar in the last 1.5 weeks, we've seen the contract pacing move up a bit in CoStar in the last 1.5 weeks. So we just saw this -- the cliff dropped quickly, and then it held there for a week or 2. And then we've seen some build underneath it. Now does that mean it's going to continue to build? Or is it going to drop again if something else happens in the economy? Or is it going to build faster? Like we don't know, but the pattern is very different in this shock than what happened in '08 as many lessons as we can from it and then just see how this thing develops in a different pattern.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to presenters for any closing remarks.
Andy Florance: Thanks for the first quarter -- joining us for the first quarter earnings call. I look forward to updating you this summer on the second quarter. And I hope you're all staying safe and well, and appreciate you all joining us here on the call today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining us. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-26 17:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: Andy Florance - Chief Executive Officer, Founder Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer Sarah Spray - Investor Relations
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the CoStar, Fourth Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Also, today’s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Sarah Spray, Investor Relations for the CoStar Group.

Over to you operator. No, sorry – actually, what am I saying? Actually, I would like to now turn the call over to our CEO, Andy Florance. Andy. 
Andy Florance: Thank you very much Sarah. We are joined… [Technical Difficulty]. 
Sarah Spray: I am sorry we are now turning over to Andy Florance who is the CEO. Apologize for the short delay. 
Andy Florance: Thank you, Sarah. Good evening. 
Operator: Sorry, this is the AT&T operator. We do not hear any sound. 
Sarah Spray: I'm sorry. 
Andy Florance: Can you hear us? 
Sarah Spray: Can you hear us now?
Operator: Yes. 
Sarah Spray: Okay, please let's continue.
Andy Florance: Okay, we’ll get going here. So good evening and thank you for joining us in CoStar Group's fourth quarter and 2019 yearend earnings call.  I'm very pleased that CoStar continued to deliver outstanding growth throughout 2019. CoStar Group’s total revenue grew 17% to $1.4 billion for 2019, adding $200 million of revenue in the full year. We generate strong double digit growth across all our primary businesses with multi-family leading the way with 21% year-over-year growth.  Fourth quarter revenue of $375 million was up 19% over the fourth quarter of 2018. The fourth quarter includes results from STR for the first time, which contributed $9 million of revenue since our late October 2019 close.  Net income for the year was $315 million, an increase of 32% over full year net income of 2018. Our adjusted EBITDA crossed over the $0.5 billion mark this year and reached $507 million, an increase of 21% over the full year of 2018 with adjusted EBITDA margins improving to 36%, a 110 basis points increase over adjusted EBITDA margins in 2018.  If you like nice round numbers that you can remember long after the call, our fourth quarter revenue annualized was $1.5 billion and our fourth quarter EBITDA was $500 million or $500 million on $1.5 billion growing.  We grew our earnings and profitability during the year, while continuing to invest for future growth. In 2019 we increased the size of our CoStar field sales force by 20% and added 40 new midmarket sales positions in Richmond for multifamily. We increased the level of spending in digital marketing later in the year to grow our traffic and the lead flow of Apartments.com.  Our product teams completed new signature ad packages in LoopNet, as well as the new digital tools for small property owners in multifamily, both of which we start selling in the fourth quarter.  The highlight metrics for 2019 and operations for CoStar group were impressive. Users viewed 6.3 billion pages on Apartments.com, commercial real-estate professionals conducted 40 million searches on CoStar, potential tenants visited LoopNet 131 million times, our clients, our researchers and software teams added 2 billion pieces of new content to our database in 2019.  Looking ahead to 2020, we continue to invest in future growth. We're focused on the huge opportunity in the Apartments marketplaces, as well as LoopNet and the massive commercial real-estate market place. We believe the addressable market for residential rental and commercial real-estate marketing alone is over 10 billion and we have a unique opportunity for growth in the early stages in these marketplaces.  We are also focused on commercial real-estate hospitality, information, analytics and software services. In 2020 we're also embracing and accelerating our international growth opportunity.  We had an excellent sales year in 2019, adding nearly 210 million of net new bookings for the year, an increase of 24% over 2018. In the fourth quarter alone we added 52 million of net new bookings. Our efforts to build online marketplaces and commercial real-estate are certainly paying off, with almost 62% of our sales in 2019 coming from Apartments.com, LoopNet and our other market places. A trend we can expect to continue into 2020.  Our Apartments.com sales team had a remarkable year in 2019. Following the integration of the ForRent acquisition in 2018, the team was at full strength and focused on growing throughout 2019. As a result, we ended the year with net new bookings up over 45%. Congratulations to Paige Forrest and the entire Apartments team on a great year.  The fourth quarter was a particularly impressive sales quarter for LoopNet. Historically the last quarter of the year has been the lowest seasonal quarter for share re-advertising. In fact when we acquired LoopNet the revenues typically fell in the fourth quarter. While today revenues typically grow in the fourth quarter, over the past five years fourth quarter LoopNet bookings have dropped sequentially, an average of 43% for the third quarter bookings levels.  That was certainly not the case this year. As part of our rebuild and launch of the LoopNet signature ad products, we rolled out a sales contest for the fourth quarter that resulted in LoopNet bookings growing 80% over the third quarter of 2019 LoopNet sales. LoopNet signature ads grew almost 500% over the same quarter in the previous year. Obviously this is an outstanding result.  I believe this is only the beginning of the LoopNet growth opportunity ahead. Our LoopNet market place had the strongest year yet in 2019 and we expect LoopNet to be a significant contributor to our growth in 2020.  LoopNet revenue was $150 million in 2019, growing 18% over full year 2018, with fourth quarter revenue growth reaching 20%. Our strategy of rebuilding and launching LoopNet as a pure online marketplace is working.  According to Google Analytics, average monthly unique visitors to LoopNet network reached 6.1 million in 2019, an increase of 16% over 2018. We believe that LoopNet has approximately 20x the monthly unique visitors of the second most trafficked sites.  In 2019 we redesigned and lost our dramatically improve signature ads for office space for lease. They're similar to the high-end quality ads on Apartments.com. Signature ads sort to the top of the results set are larger than the standard ads and contain much more marketing content than to the standard ads. The signature ads are featured prominently across multiple CoStar Group's CRE marketplaces, information solutions and newsletters. We also retarget LoopNet visitors as they move across the web; it's coming out this quarter.  Our signature ad diamond level delivers 24x more impressions than our basic ad tier. The signature ads on LoopNet present very high quality architectural imagery, including photographs shot by our professional photographers, drone videos and 3D walkthroughs. Our marketing consultants curate and provide rich content for the signature ads. In some the signature ad features dramatically expand the reach, frequency and brand impact of our clients’ property marketing.  We're now working on building out similar detailed ad packages for the retail, industrial land, multifamily and investment sales sectors which we will launch across the year. These advertisements provide exceptional value for owners of commercial properties that need to fill vacant space or sell a building. Remember that these buildings and the vacant space in them can be worth millions, hundreds of millions, and even billions of dollars.  By using Google Analytics and tracking the IP addresses of end users searching on LoopNet, we can see that many, if not most of the largest companies across the U.S. are regularly searching for space on LoopNet and then signing multimillion leases with our clients. For example, we can see users originating from Amazon IP addresses and from IP addresses of similar mega companies viewing properties on LoopNet and then in the ensuing months we see them purchase or lease those properties.  In some cases we see major tenants giving a property on LoopNet months before their tenant-rep brokers first view the property. That suggested the tenant is finding the property first and sharing it with their broker. This should not surprise anyone, because that's exactly how the process now works today in residential real-estate.  We believe that this is a seismic shift in how owners affectively market commercial properties. An owner now needs an effective strategy to market their property directly to the tenant. Traditionally or historically in commercial real-estate the broker built a short list of potential properties for a major tenet to consider, and then closely accompanied that tenant on that all so important tour of those perspective properties.  Owners marketing efforts have focused on making sure they made that brokers shortlist. They spend billions each year to accomplish that. Now it appears tenants are building their own shortlist online by themselves on sites like LoopNet, and the first tour of the property occurs virtually online on LoopNet.  In many cases the tenant will spend dramatically more time exploring the property virtually online than they will spend physically touring it before they sign a lease. To be clear, tenants will continue to use brokers to represent them, but the marketing realities are shifting dramatically. These are huge industry changes.  We have thousands of examples, suggesting that tenants now find their space on LoopNet. We saw Facebook IPs viewing six new locations repeatedly on LoopNet and then Facebook later signed an estimated 670 million lease deals on those properties. Similarly PwC executed seven lease deals on properties they viewed on LoopNet with a value of approximately $145 million. And there are many other examples, including a single ad on LoopNet for an office business park in Pennsylvania where we can see six of its new tenants viewed the properties on LoopNet first before they signed a lease.  We're investing a lot of effort into training our sales team on the best way to communicate the value of marketing on LoopNet. It’s often a good idea to run a contest to get a sales forces attention. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we ran a LoopNet sales contest that delivered very strong results. Our field sales force shortly thereafter sold five times the number of signature ads value in Q4 than they did in the quarter prior year.  A year ago our sales team was focused on selling relatively lower cost LoopNet listing plans to brokers. Now they're shifting their focus to selling much more significant placements to the owners of the properties who have so much more to win from a successful lease.  When we acquired LoopNet, the marketing potential of LoopNet was an afterthought and non-differentiated ads were often given away for free or sold to brokers for as little as a few dollars a month. I believe the average ad was about $14 a month back in 2011. We still sell very affordable and effective basic ads to brokers, but with the very valuable signature ads the average price point is averaging almost $3000 per month.  To preserve the value and impact of a diamond or platinum signature ad, we capped the inventory to three or 10 respectively per submarket. While this preserves their value, it also creates scarcity. As a result we're seeing some owners make some significant, but we would argue very wise investment in the signature ads in high profile submarkets for important buildings.  The Durst Organization owns and manages a fantastic 750,000 square foot office property in the Times Square submarket New York. They are currently marketing 470,000 square feet of really nice space there. They know that major tenants are searching for their next spare on LoopNet and that top brokers search for their tenant space on CoStar.  Durst wants to make sure that they have the biggest, most prominent presence on the internet for the best building in Times Square. They locked in one of three diamond ad slots in Times Square for $11,000 a month on a six month agreement. They've locked in a number of other slots for other great properties at similar price points. You have to stop and think about that, that price point is almost 1000 times the old price point for lower quality, undifferentiated ads.  But I would argue Durst knows exactly the value of effective leasing. Leasing that space on a 10 year deal could generate $300 million to $400 million of revenue for Durst. Would you invest $66,000 for an effective marketing solution that could bring you a $400 million deal?  The price points we're seeing for commercial office space ads on LoopNet are now thousands of dollars above the prior price points we achieve on Apartments.com; that makes sense. Major apartment development and lease, may sign leases with the value of $10 million whereas a major commercial lease is worth hundreds of millions.  There is a company based in Australia that we admire called REA Group that provides a commercial property market place there. Their commercial and developer depths on subscriptions generated $134 million Australian dollars in 2019. I believe that's basically an equivalent of an Australian LoopNet.  The U.S. economy is approximately 15x larger than Australia's. If you scale the REA commercial business pro rate, it implies a $1.3 billion addressable size of market in the U.S. for LoopNet. Overall, we believe we are seeing clear evidence that LoopNet represents a multimillion growth opportunity.  Our Apartments business delivered a stellar year, achieving 21% revenue growth in 2019, making this the fifth consecutive year of revenue growth over 20%. According to ComScore, our apartments.com network had almost 650 million in 2019, a 22% increase over visits in ’18. We averaged over 20 million monthly unique visitors to our sites to ’19, an increase of 15%.  During the second half of the year, apartments.com moved ahead of the seller rentals and monthly unique visitors and continues to attract more visitors than Chile Rentals, Rent.com, HotPads Apartment list, StreetEasy, Apartment Guide, Zumper, RENTCafe, apartment rating's, rentals.com and many others that compete for renters in this space.  When we acquired apartments.com in 2014, they and the industry were largely focused on selling advertising to large apartment communities with more than 120 units. That was a huge loss, because approximately 65% of renters or rents and properties that are in buildings with less than 120 units. The industry was missing 65% of the potential market. That strategy was an artifact of the old print world where your volume of ads were limited by the maximum number of pages glue could hold together in a book.  Today apartments.com does not rely on glue, so we focus on selling marketing services to all sizes of rental properties. There’s three major ways in which we’re doing this. First, we're building tools that enable an owner of a single rental or small apartment to buy via e-commerce ad placements and comprehensive digital leasing tools. Second, we're building a large Richmond based sales team focused on selling into the mid-market apartment opportunity and single rental opportunity. And finally, we are accelerating our investment in apartments marketing to lift awareness for apartments.com across all of these segments, single, rental, mid-market and large.  In the fourth quarter of 2019 we began beta testing our online renter tools, which are aimed at facilitating and improving the customer and landlord experience for leasing smaller apartment buildings and rental homes. Our new online leasing tools give landlords the ability to create a listing, perform credit and background checks, create an exchange and sign leases and provide a platform for deposits and rental payments.  These tools are offered free to landlords, independent owners as a way to drive consumer adoption and build a national network for digital leasing. In addition, we offer the option to purchase an ad on apartments.com, which provides better placement and twice the leads as a free basic listing does. We launched a full national rollout on January 15, 2020. The uptake has been very encouraging. So far we already have nearly 17,000 active users of the digital tools. 2,000 landlords have purchased ads via E-commerce and over 2,000 potential rentals have completed online applications. This is excellent adoption when you consider that we've yet to launch in any of our news supporting advertising campaign. I'm really pleased with the headway we're making and look forward to keeping you posted on our progress throughout the year. Our Apartment field sales force is an excellent one, but is nowhere near large enough to sell into millions of rental units in properties that are smaller than 100 units. The current sales force is doing is excellent work generating huge revenue growth in the 100 unit plus world and we want them to keep doing that. We've just launched the mid-market sales team in Richmond with 40 sales people. They are prospecting and selling into communities that are small, mid-sized or large in contrast to the field sales teams that are selling into huge communities.  In the first few months, this new sales team is doubling their sales production each month. At this point 84% of the team has achieved their first sales and 100% of the October 1 class is now selling.  Top producer Morgan Rogers delivered 6,000 of net new monthly sales from last month, which is more than 90% that the field sales team was able to achieve in January. In total, the group has sold 200 property ads. The vast majority of those properties they’ve sold were into properties with less than 50 units. Once we have the vast majority of this mid-market groups selling at their full potential, we plan to grow the team indefinitely, so long as it remains a clear positive ROI. Back in October we announced that we’ll be stepping-up our apartments.com marketing spend by an incremental $100 million, to a spend level of approximately $250 million in 2020. Over the past few months our team RPA and Jeff Goldblum has been working hard to build our 2020 marketing program.  The 20 campaign will clearly be our biggest ever. Our plan is to deliver 10 billion impressions, and 800 million renter visits, a significant increase over the 6 billion impressions and 650 million renter visits we generate in 2019.  The expanded campaign is expected to drive our unaided brand awareness higher over the long term. We currently fluctuate in the low 30% range for unaided awareness when our media campaigns are running. Our goal is to reach over 40% unaided awareness this year and eventually 50% as we continue beyond 2020.  Once again, we have Brad Bellflower inventory apart on Internet played by Jeff Goldblum leading our Apartments.com campaign. We plan to double the investment in TV, launching in mid-March and stay on the air through November reaching 95% of households with more frequency than ever.  We rent 10,000 TV spots in ‘19 and we plan to run 20,000 spots in 2020. We will air in Prime Time, Premieres, Finale’s and top rated sports events, including the summer Olympics and the NFL. We will focus again on reaching the cord cutter audience with three times the video on demand through YouTube, Hulu and other streaming services.  This year we have selected 37 of the top local apartment markets to provide increased local presence media and focus. These were the markets with the most growth opportunity for apartments.com. We plan to increase our exposure in these key markets by 50% and include custom market specific TV versions of our advertisements.  We will create our biggest digital presence targeting 2 billion impressions through display advertising and retargeting an increased presence on social media, making sure we're there whenever renters are online. Our marketing message for the first half of the year will focus great lengths on apartments – we’ll be looking at the great lengths that apartments.com goes to, to make sure that renters will find their greatest number of rental options on apartments.com.  With 40 million people having found their next place on apartments.com, the campaign establishes apartments.com as the most popular site for renting an apartment. Beginning in July, we’ll launch the second half of our 2020 campaign, which will be focused on our new online renter applications tools, which we rolled out nationwide in January.  The message is one of simplicity, that you can now apply for a new home with a single click. In one commercial a man is devastated because the love of his life has just dumped him and told him to move out. A tear rolls down his cheek and lands on his iPhone hitting the rent-now button on apartments.com. With the tear driven click he rents the perfect apartment as he moves in he finds the next real love of his life. Isn't life grand?  In 2020 we expect to invest $110 million to $115 million in paid search, approximately twice the run rate of the spend in ‘19. We are focusing on specific neighborhoods and appearing 95% of time in the top positions in Google searches. We've seen the benefit this has brought us in terms of increased traffic share over the past few months of ‘19. We intend to maintain this spend over the year.  This magnitude of investment to keywords is efficient for three reasons. First, with our massive branding campaign, renters recognize apartments.com and are more likely to click on it driving our cost per click down comparatively. Secondly, we currently appear in the number one SCO position on 20,000 important apartment keywords 90% of the time.  When renters see us in both top organic and top page placement, we believe they recognize us as an authority, resulting in 4x not 2x, the clicks you would expect from two placements. Finally, we have a large number of apartment advertisers who are effectively pulling their resources through apartments.com in order to afford the very expensive best keywords on Google.  Two weeks ago we announced our agreement to acquire RentPath from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The transaction is subject to the customary closing conditions, regulatory review, as well as approval by the bankruptcy at court. We are in the early days the process, which could last anywhere from three to 12 month.  I want to emphasize that we believe our acquisition of the RentPath business, especially our ability to invest in their product and marketing represents the best way forward for all stakeholders. As we discussed earlier, giving its crippling debt burden, RentPath was simply not able to buy enough traffic from Google or to build a consumer marketing brand to give their sites a recognizable brand.  Harvest.com, RentPath and Zillow, all rely to one degree or another on Google to drive traffic to their websites. The price of many popular apartment rental key words or SCM has soared over the past two years, climbing several hundred percent. For example, in ‘18 the keyword for Downtown Los Angeles apartments could be purchased for $0.42. By 2020 it's reached $7.56 for an increase of 714%.  Apartments.com has enough budget resources, continuing to invest in these keywords and spread the cost out across a large customer base. By contrast RentPath was priced out and resorted to purchasing a volume of keywords such as apartments for rent under $500 in Los Angeles.  Out of 33,000 apartments for rent in LA, the other one I found for under $500 was an upper bunk in a group house in South Central LA. That is not the market institutional apartment advertisers are trying to reach with their dollar. In addition, RentPath number one supplier Google is also competing directly against them for the same business.  In contrast, we believe that synergies, efficiencies and scale we could gain from the combination will make it possible to continue to sustain more advertising and marketing to build more brand awareness and in turn generate an increased flow of quality leads for all of our customers.  It's important to building enough scale, that we can build more direct traffic to our sites that are not subject to Google price increases. From where we stand today, the proposed timeline is not changed versus two weeks ago and we look forward to being able to welcome the RentPath websites and their team to CoStart before the end of 2020.  RentPath has an excellent field sales team led by Arlene Mayfield. They've earned our respect as a very capable group of competitors with great relationships in the industry. As we grow our sales force to meet the opportunities we have in LoopNet, the Apartments, Biz by Sell, Lands of America and other marketplaces, we look forward to joining with them and the rest of the RentPath team as colleagues.  This quarter we released a great new feature in CoStar that makes public record data on 33 million properties accessible through CoStar. This enables our users to see raw data on virtually every commercially zoned parcel in the US. They can search the public record data directly and see the record ownership, loan, valuation, data zoning and more. In total there are 150 attributes.  The public record date is connected to the CoStar data on the same properties making it convenient to cross reference the information. In the second quarter we plan to add the ability to search lenders and their loan activity. In the third quarter we’ll integrate state corporation data to allow users to research who the people are behind the companies that own these properties.  In the fourth quarter we’ll have permit, planning, and in lean searches. This will allow users to monitor who is building the new properties, who is renovating and which companies are moving into new facilities or expanding. These features will be provided to our customers at no extra charge in order to enhance the value of our products, extend the reach of CoStar to more customers and renew more business.  Since closing the acquisition of STR in October, I'm more positive than ever that STR and CoStar together can create significant value for all partnered participants in the hospitality sector, and in the part of commercial real-estate that focuses on hospitality.  We’ve had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from customers of both STR and CoStar. The STR customers recognize the technology and integrated product expertise that CoStar can bring, and the CoStar multi-family customers would love to see STR create benchmarking products for the apartment industry. In addition brokers, developers, lenders, appraisers and local government are excited about having access to high quality hospitality statistics within CoStar. It's great to see such a positive response, which further confirms our rationale for combining these two businesses.  I’m also delighted by the enthusiasm and dedication of the STR team. Amanda Hite, CEO of STR told me recently that the reaction of her staff has been ecstatic, and that they are all very confident about their future in the CoStar family. We are ecstatic as well.  Combine the data and technology of STR with the data analytics and software from CoStar is one of our biggest development projects and priorities for 2020. We're working hard on completing the technology integration by the end of 2020, which will position us to focus on growing the combined business, which we believe is a potential $500 million addressable market, as outlined when we announced the acquisition four months ago.  Finally, I'll conclude by reviewing where we stand in the commercial real-estate economy. Total investment to commercial and multi-family real-estate set a new record in ‘19 topping 650 billion for the first time. Fundamentals remain very healthy as well, with vacancy rates near record lows with limited construction. Despite the lack of space available though, leasing activity continues to rise and all property types posted rent gains for a 10th consecutive year, although the pace of rent gains has slowed slightly.  In the multi-family sector elevated supply continues to meet with strong demand, both from renters and investors. The sector set a new record with nearly $190 billion investments in 2019 and the multi-family vacancy rate held steady at just about 6%.  Many of these renters would likely have been home buyers in another time. Today, those single family home construction remains at very low levels relative to population, and urban apartment development has largely replaced the suburban subdivision as the new model of American housing.  At present we're tracking about 630,000 new apartment units under construction. We believe that most of these units, as well as the 330,000 units that delivered last year will be advertised on apartments.com.  In the office sector, large tech occupiers continue the least large blocks of space despite single digit vacancy rates and limited new supply. However, the developments underway is largely concentrated in markets long considered to be supply constrained like New York, San Francisco, Boston, Washington DC. In these markets, new office developments have fundamentally shifted the geography of office demand, with major tenants leaving aging space and traditional CBDs for new space in Hudson Yards, the Boston Seaport, South of Market in San Francisco, and the Capital River front to say nothing of National Landing in Washington, DC.  In the industrial sector demand slowed in ’19, but mostly because so little space is currently available. The vacancy rates rose over the year, but to just 5%, which is extremely low. Despite the ultra-low vacancies, leasing actually picked up anticipating the coming wave of supply. Rent growth slowed, but at 5% it’s still really strong, and investments set a new record at more than $120 billion.  In the retail sector, gloomy headlines obscure the reality that retail vacancy rates are at historic lows and rents are rising in most markets. The wave of urban apartment development in markets large and small has left many downtown areas under retailed, relative to growing populations and in need of grocery stores and pharmacies to say nothing of restaurants and bars. The little supply is underway and some markets are even seeing a net reduction space as the front big boxes or malls are repurposed.  Economic conditions support ongoing commercial and multi-family real-estate activity at similar levels. Economic uncertainty, particularly around trade, the coronavirus, and the 2020 election have brought interest rates back to historic lows, supporting investment real-estate even at very low cap rates, and ongoing economic growth and consistent job gains are driving demand for physical space.  CoStar’s Group products and services have become important tools for owners, managers and developers and investors to make quality choices and realize successful outcomes in any economic environment.  Clearly, the coronavirus is becoming a factor in our economy. As a company we're making preparations in the event the outbreak impacts in areas where we have significant operations. Fortunately, we do not have factory floors, nor do we have together clients’ physically to provide our services. As we've already done in China, we're planning to disperse operations to work-at-home status if outbreaks occur in cities where we operate in.  Before I hand it over to Scott, who is less concern about that, I would like to acknowledge that our outstanding 2019 results would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all of our awesome CoStar team members. No matter where you are around the world or what part of the business you support, I'm very proud of the people that make CoStar a great place to work.  I will now turn the call over to our metrics obsessed CFO, Scott Wheeler. 
Scott Wheeler : Thank you, Andy. Give me just a second. Before I take the microphone, I must disinfect it with this little wipe which I have here to display my concern of the virus and other issues.  Alright, we had a great year in 2019. We reached $1.4 billion in revenue, exceeded $500 million in adjusted EBITDA and delivered over $200 million of net new bookings for the year. In addition, we acquired STR and off-campus partners in 2019 and we recently announced an agreement to acquire RentPath.  It’s great to see that we continue our very successful strategy of both double digit organic growth, coupled with highly synergistic acquisition programs. We certainly don't see either of these growth strategies slowing down any time soon.  Our fourth quarter 2019 revenue was $375 million growing 19% year-over-year and coming at $9 million above the high-end of our guidance range. Revenue growth in the fourth quarter excluding STR was 16% year-over-year.  STR contributed $9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which exceeded the $3 million to $4 million of STR revenue expected. This is primarily the result of favorable outcomes from the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. We've included the revenue from STR as part of our information services revenue sector.  Looking at our revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was 13% for the full year of 2019 as expected, and 14% in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018. As we head into 2020 we anticipate CoStar Suite revenue growth will moderate somewhat as we have shifted the focus of our sales teams to ramp up sales of the net signature asset that Andrew mentioned. The revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite in 2020 is expected to be approximately 11%.  As Andy discussed, it's important that our field sales team learns how to sell high value add packages directly to owners, even if it comes with a slight substitution effect in the near term on the CoStar side of the business. Over time we believe the relationships that the sales team builds now selling LoopNet to owners, will pay off in sales of CoStar Suite subscriptions to those very same owners in the future. On a combined basis, looking at CoStar Suite and LoopNet together, the incremental LoopNet revenue in 2020 is expected to more than offset the anticipated slower revenue growth in CoStar Suite.  Revenue in information services for the full year of 2019 grew 31% to $88 million. Excluding STR, the full year growth rate was 17% with CoStar Real Estate Manager growing 34% year-over-year. Revenue and information services for the fourth quarter of 2019 grew 52% versus the fourth quarter of 2018, which translates to around 3% revenue growth in the fourth quarter excluding STR. We expect reported revenue from information services to grow at a rate of 60% to 64% in 2020 with STR expected to contribute approximately $61 million to $63 million in revenue in 2020.  Multifamily revenue growth for the full year 2019 remained strong at 21% versus 2018 and fourth quarter 2019 grew 20% over the fourth quarter 2018. Our multifamily revenue growth is split between an 11% increase in volume of properties advertising on the network and a 10% increase in average revenue per property. For the fourth quarter 2019 our average revenue per property reached $800 as our customers continued to buy higher value advertising packages for increased lead performance. We did not increase list prices for any of our multifamily advertising in 2019.  Looking forward we expect multifamily revenue growth to continue at approximately 20% for the full year of 2020. Our forecast assumes continued strong growth from our field sales team, selling into larger communities, with a growing contribution throughout the year from our mid-market sales teams. We assume minimal revenue contribution from smaller independent owners using our digital tools in 2020 as we focus on landlord adoption of these digital tools so we can build scale.  Commercial property and land revenue grew 17% year-over-year for the full year of 2019 and 18% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our LoopNet marketplace represents approximately 75% of the revenue in the commercial property and land products sector. As we continue to reposition LoopNet as a premium advertising solution to property owners, we're seeing growth rate accelerate. In the fourth quarter of 2019 LoopNet advertising revenues grew 20%, which is double the rate that LoopNet revenue was growing in mid-2018.  For 2020 we expect growth rates for LoopNet to move up over 25% in the second half of the year. Commercial property and land sector is expected to deliver approximately 22% revenue growth for the full year 2020.  Looking at our gross margins, we came in at 79% for 2019, up almost 2% versus 2018. This is a result of our very strong cost leverage. Our gross margin came in at 80% in the fourth quarter 2019, in-line with the margin we achieved in the third quarter of 2019. We expect our overall gross margins to move up to 81% in 2020.  Net income for the full year of 2019 was $315 million, a 32% increase compared to the prior year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $88 million, an increase of 5% or $4 million compared to Q4 2018. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 23%, while our effective tax rate for the full year of 2019 was 19%.  Adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2019 was $507 million, a 21% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $418 million for the full year of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 36% increased 110 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. I'm pleased with our ability to increase profitability for the year and at the same time increase investments in our new product developments and the apartment search marketing that we did in the second half of 2019.  Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $142 million was approximately $7 million above the top end of our guidance range. Favorable revenue of $5 million from STR related to purchase accounting and other revenue favorability has contributed to the positive variance.  Non-GAAP net income for the full year of 2019 was $373 million or $10.19 per diluted share, above the high point of our guidance by $0.17 and an increase of 23% compared to full year 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter 2019 increased to $103 million or $2.82 per diluted share.  We received an insurance settlement of approximately $11 million related to the Xceligent litigation in the fourth quarter of 2019, which we recorded in other non-operating income. We adjusted this settlement gain out of the non-GAAP net income.  Non net GAAP net income also includes adjustments for stock based compensation and STR acquisition related expenses. Non GAAP net income for the fourth quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include discrete items such as the impact of share based payment transactions.  Our cash investment balances were approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, which is almost identical to our cash balance at the end of 2018. We generated a little over $450 million in cash from operations this year and then we plunked it all down to by STR; it was a great way to use cash I think.  Now, let's take a look at some performance metrics for the quarter, none of which include any performance metrics for STR, which we’ll add later in this year.  At the end of the fourth quarter 2019 our sales force totaled approximately 844 people, up about 24 people from the third quarter of 2019, and up over 100 people from the fourth quarter of 2018. The sales force growth in Q4 was primarily in our multifamily mid-market sales teams. We expect to ramp up headcount in this team towards the target of 100 people later in 2020.  We ended the year with approximately 275 sales people in our CoStar LoopNet sales team, an increase of 20% for the year, but a bit short of our goal to grow the team by 30% during the year. We expect to reach approximately 300 field sales reps in this team sometime in the second quarter of 2020; hopefully earlier rather than later.  The renewal rate on annual contracts for the fourth quarter 2019 was in-line with the rate achieved in the third quarter of 2019 at 90%. Renewal rate for the quarter for customers who’ve been subscribers for five years or longer was 95%, in-line with the renewal rate of 95% in the third quarter of 2019.  Finally, subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 83% of our revenue in the fourth quarter, up approximately 1 point compared to Q4 last year.  I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the first quarter of 2020. To be clear, our outlook does not include the impact of the proposed RentPath acquisition. However, we've included approximately $7 million of legal and other professional fees associated with the pending transaction. It included these costs in the non-GAAP adjustments to EBITDA and net income.  I'll begin with the outlook for STR. As we said previously, the business exited 2019 and a revenue run rate in the low $60 million range. We will lose a few million dollars of GAAP revenue in the initial quarters due to purchase accounting adjustments. For 2020 we expect that STR will contribute approximately $14 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2020 and approximately $60 million to $63 million in revenue for the full year.  The purchase accounting impacts to revenue and EBITDA primarily impact the fourth quarter 2019 and the first two quarters of 2020. We expect EBITDA for STR to be between negative $7 million to negative $9 million for 2020, which includes significant retention bonuses paid by the seller, along with other acquisition related costs. After adjusting for these costs and other typical items like stock compensation, we expect adjusted EBIDTDA for STR of between $7 million to $9 million for the year.  STR adjusted EBITDA is expected be roughly breakeven in the first half of the year and turning positive beginning in the third quarter, after we move past those purchase accounting adjustments. These estimated impacts to revenue and adjusted EBITDA from the acquisition of STR are included in the following consolidated outlook for 2020.  We expect revenue in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.665 billion for the full year of 2020. This implies an annual growth rate of 18% to 19% over 2019. Excluding STR we expect revenue growth rate of approximately 15% for the full year of 2019.  We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2020 in the range of $387 million to $392 million. This represents approximately 18% to 19% growth compared to the first quarter of last year, and approximately 14% to 15% growth excluding the first quarter revenue contributions from STR. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $520 million to $530 million for the full year of 2020, representing 3% to 4% growth versus the first full year of 2019.  As we discussed on our third quarter results call this past October, we plan to increase our marketing spend for multifamily by approximately $100 million in 2020, bringing our total multifamily marketing budget up to approximately $250 million. Excluding the impact of STR which I just discussed, our organic adjusted EBITDA margin for 2020 is expected to be approximately 32%, down 400 basis points compared to 2019 as we discussed back in the October conference call.  Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be between $115 million to $120 million. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to decline from the first quarter as we've seen in the past years, as the department's media campaign ramps up during the peak rental season, with significant increases in adjusted EBITDA and margins in the third and fourth quarter. We anticipate our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be at or above the 38% adjusted EBITDA margin we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019.  In terms of earnings, we expect full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $10.20 to $10.40 based on 36.8 million shares. For the first quarter of 2020 we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $2.25 and $2.35 based on 36.7 million shares.  In summary, we had a fantastic 2019 and we’ve set ourselves up for a great performance in 2020 and beyond. We believe that by continuing to invest aggressively in our business in the form of new products, marketing and acquisitions, we’re positioning the company for years of strong growth and attractive EBITDA margins.  As I’ve said many times, our margin trajectory may vary considerably from year-to-year based on the timing of investments; however, I'm confident we're still on track to reach our long term goals of $3 billion in run rate revenue and 40% plus the adjusted EBITDA margins in 2023.  Having read all of those numbers, it is time to open up the call now for questions. 
Sarah Spray : So, we’ll now turn over to the operator who will give you instructions for logging on, but we would also ask that you limit your questions to one question per person. If we have time, we’ll cycle the queue back around.  Operator, you may proceed. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Tomasello with KBW, please go ahead. 
Ryan Tomasello: Good evening everyone. Congrats on the strong finish to the year! I wanted to ask about apartments.com. You know clearly the platform continues to see strong momentum and it seems that the push into the middle market and the low end of the market held its promise, but I was hoping Andy that you can give us some color on your thoughts around how you frame the risk of competitive pressures in the market for lead generation.  You know I think on the RentPath call you alluded to the position that Google has in that market in controlling renter traffic. So I was wondering you know if you see the risk of them increasing their stake in this market as a threat similar to what they've done in the online travel booking world. 
Andy Florance: Sure. So certainly Google has a full position on controlling renter flow, the majority of renter flow. In the online travel world the OTA’s like Bookings.com or Expedia has spent – invested large sums of money to build direct traffic that are independent of Google intermediation. You know frankly, while they have – those hotel OTA’s have taken a bit of a hit, they still have outstanding margins and very profitable businesses.  So you know we think that Google is a competitive factor there, growing revenue in the apartment space. People do make a decision between spending the money directly with Google or spending the money with apartments.com, but we believe we offer a number of advantages, have some strong client loyalty and we will continue to grow and thrive. And while we look at Google as providing a competitive element to the company, we also look at them as a very important partner and we believe that our investments into Google keywords and other initiatives with them has been very fruitful. So you know nothing in life is without some risk, but we feel comfortable with it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan, please go ahead. 
Jackson Ader: Hey, thanks. Hi guys, this Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. 
A - Andy Florance: Hello Jackson.
Jackson Ader: My question is on the middle market sales. Now that that sales team is kind of up and running, how should we or how are you guys thinking about the unit economics for that particular segment? 
Andy Florance: I believe it's running about an average of $320 per unit, something like that.
A - Scott Wheeler: That was definitely in the Silver Ads and overall it's about $440 million what we sold so far and the largest mix of ads as we mentioned was in the silver level within some gold segments and platinum and diamonds then sold by the team.
A - Andy Florance: But don't get excited, because there’s only tens of millions of opportunities down there in that segment. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair, please go ahead. 
Stephen Sheldon : Hi, thanks, and that was a lot of detail. Andy, you know there was a brief comment in your prepared remarks that you plan to accelerate international growth this year, so I wanted to get some more detail on that. I know you've been gathering data in the U.K., I think Spain, Germany and France and have Realla in the U.K. that you've talked about using to gather public data and parts of Europe, but I guess first, do you have an update of scale internationally to more meaningfully monetize it at this point. And second, is the plan here to accelerate; I guess data gathering maybe with STR's international footprint in EMEA and APAC. 
A - Andy Florance: Yes, so STR does have a really strong international footprint you know leading with their leadership team then for HVAC and the 9Vietnam. It’s a strong group and it's a great foundation to grow in.  You know what we're thinking about in 2020, I do not believe we’ll have a huge, negative financial impact to drag on earnings or a material one. What it's really about is acknowledging the fact that we now have 500 staff and tens of thousands of users outside of the United States in multiple and dozens of different countries. I think we have users in probably 60, 70 some countries at this point and so a lot of it is how we're thinking about providing the product and the service and delivering it.  So as we pull STR and CoStar together, it's going to be important that both of those platforms support users in dozens of countries. We want to continue the work we began with apartments.com and make all of our products polyglot [ph] ideally supporting both the English language and the local language in those products.  We also want to make the movement between viewing data in various countries as seamless as possible. So today a user in London or a user in Madrid may look at our product as being very local to that town, and we believe there would be value in just opening up that system. If they are subscribing to their local country, we would let them see the international network.  So that would be a pretty big change when an investment broker in London can see and compare a property in London, Edinburgh to a property in Toronto or Vancouver or New Mexico or Madrid. And so that will be the first big change and we think it will have a pretty positive impact. That's the way Bloomberg has segmented their products. If you are a Bloomberg client you can see all over the world.  We want to go that way, so people don't evaluate us as a single city player anywhere and that they can work in their native language. That's particularly valuable in investment sales area and in the analytics area where we think we can provide a lot of value. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mario Cortellacci with Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Mario Cortellacci : Hi, thanks for the time. Because you're shifting the sales force focus from going from CoStar Suite over to LoopNet, could you just update us on how many CoStar customers are using LoopNet and vice versa or maybe just give us a little more a quick update on how much runway still exists there. 
Andy Florance: So in particular you are talking about – we were talking about the runway for both of them. I was talking about the runway for CoStar and the runway for LoopNet. I plan to live for a very, very, long time and I will not live long enough to ever see the end of runway for either CoStar or LoopNet. So we just have – you know I’m back in the place where I'm feeling like our CoStar sales force is smaller than the opportunity they're selling into, because that CoStar sales forces is a CoStar and LoopNet sales force.  There is very high overlap between the people who we’re trying to sell CoStar to and to the people who would be – would benefit from marketing on a LoopNet. So very, very high overlap both ways. I would think I don't have a hard number on that, but I would believe it’s the majority.  Now, some of the new particularly valuable customers to us for CoStar – so an important area for us in CoStar is selling to owners that you know we are in the early stages of penetrating that opportunity, they have high value, they pay higher numbers for CoStar, but a great avenue to reach them is to provide a marketing solution for them in LoopNet that's unique, and new and different and allows us to build a relationship with them, and then ultimately to expand that relationship to ride them information analytics.  We believe that our offering is incredibly compelling to that owner universe on both sides. So I really mean that. I think it's a huge market. By the time we sell everybody in Czechoslovakia the CoStar subscription, we’ll be in like 2320. 
Operator: Our next question is from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. 
Brett Huff: Good evening guys. 
Andy Florance: Hello Brett. 
Brett Huff: My question is, it seems that the guidance implies organically about 15% growth and Scott I think you give us that number, and by my math I think you guys end up the year pretty close to that in ‘19 give or take. First of all, correct me if I’m off at all, but I think I’m close.  My question is, given that the ad spend is going ramp pretty dramatically through the year, why wouldn't we expect to see more revenue growth, especially in the back half of the year than we did say in 2019. 
Andy Florance: I was asking Fred Saint and Paige Forrest the same question, but go ahead Scott. 
Scott Wheeler: You’re correct, we have about a 15% organic growth rate scheduled out for the year. We certainly see solid growth starting into the year. We had a great year selling in apartments you know at the end of last year. We'll start to get the ramp-up in the marketing stand. It starts in the mid to late March time frame and that's when our broadcast advertising will kick in, and then by the time we hit mid to late summer, we’ll start to advertise more around the use of our one-click you know digital rental tools that Andy was mentioning.  So we've built in really this year, we’ve built in a – the 20% growth is almost entirely from our large directions field sales team in large Apartments. The amount of revenue that we're forecasting right now on the inside sales team is very small and we're really forecasting nothing coming from the value in the market place.  So what we're doing this year is really building the brand, building the momentum, building the sales forces and those capabilities in mid-market and building the network in the small property space, with really revenue on to come. We’d love to see those develop rapidly in the first half and really take off in the second, but at this stage we're planning on really taking the large market and decent momentum into the mid-markets, but really much beyond that in our forecast right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Pete Christiansen : Thank you, good evening; great momentum guys. I just want to follow-up on that last question. I know you don't provide an outlook for bookings, but how should we think about the cadence throughout the year? Is it something that starts picking up in 2Q, 3Q and just building from there or is it more of a hump? I know there’s a lot of moving pieces hiring and all that other stuff, but how should we think about the cadence? 
Andy Florance: I think the starts to really advise the cadence, particularly with the combined CoStar LoopNet sales force, and then later in the year your building that mid-market sales force. That's really what's different than maybe what we’ve seen in the past. Otherwise you know we typically see, second quarter be a very strong sales quarter, third quarter a little bit less than that, and I think like we saw this year, fourth quarter which we just proved in the LoopNet we can actually sell advertising in the fourth quarter which hadn't really been the case in the past.  I think both in Apartments and LoopNet you’ll see fourth quarter strong quarters, and I think technically it would be our second strongest quarter in Apartments. So the bill will go in the sales headcount in general and then the others regular seasonality patterns will hold up for the year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You're going after the middle-market and I/O subsegments of the multifamily space this year. You talked about launching tools, targeting smaller properties, building out your Richmond sales team and then also accelerating investments into Apartments marketing. Can you discuss how you plan to phase in these initiatives? How much growth acceleration in multi-family in general you expect from these initiatives, and then how your strategy aligns with your proposed acquisition of RentPath? 
Andy Florance: Sure, so I don't think anyone ever taught me about phasing, we just do it all at once. Phasing is now. Sure, I’ll go on now. I mean we've been working on the I/O initiative for a long time, so that's been a year and a half or more of software development acquisitions and research. So we ran the first focus groups on that I/O product over two years ago in tweaking and adjusting the business model.  Now it's in the markets, its national and we're seeing great traction. We are seeing revenue growth from it, because people are opting in a really good clip to e-commerce purchase of Advertising theses individual properties, buying an add-on on apartments.com. So that will track through the year. We are going to watch it really closely and grow it. I have been out talking to a lot of leaders, the biggest clients in the multifamily industry over the last couple of weeks and I have been surprised by their interest in those leasing tools, and participating in those programs. So we are going to also focus this year on potentially enabling more of our larger customers to put the leasing tools on apartments.com, so people can initiate a lease from apartments.com directly into our clients’ back-end system.  So that would make that tool work throughout the spectrum. That would have a good impact on revenue throughout the year. One of the highlights for me last week was I was meeting with one of our biggest customers, the President of one our biggest customers, who manages hundreds of thousands of units. He just bought a very small 10 unit property for himself, as a gaag I guess, I don’t know, and he said he was shocked at when we got this property. He had no idea how to lease the property. He’s got thousands of people for his big business, but he doesn't have the leases on property. So he's actually becoming a client for our online leasing tools for small property owners, which is helpful as we try to move it upstream. So the mid-market, we're being careful there because we're launching a new sales model. It involves bringing on a lot of relatively new people, both at the line sales person and the manager doing something kind of new. So we want to make sure they bring their skill sets fully up to development before we start scaling the group. We want to be careful that it doesn't scale too quickly and that we lose control of quality and then struggle to bring it back.  So we're waiting till they're all up in producing at a good level and we’ve sort of worked out kinks and then we’ll begin slow a measured growth through the year there, but that really is a group that could go from 40 to 100, from 40 to 200, from 40 to 300 over time, as it has a good ROI.  Then how well that integrates in with what we are doing with the RentPath acquisition? Well, we had a lot of great products here with good growth and we are prospecting unfortunately a relatively – e-commerce solutions are working at the I/O side, but we are prospecting a relatively small percentage of our target market and with the RentPath acquisition that would bring more sales resources into our organization, for both selling as Apartment industry and then also into the other market places that we’re active in. So with the Apartments sales conference, one of things we did is, we began to present training materials on LoopNet in order to familiarize the Apartment sales team with that and we ended up a lot of interest with people who want to move in there. So hopefully we are able to close the RentPath deal and move some more people into the apartment side.  The other thing RentPath helps support us with is that it enabled us – RentPath – probably the most important thing RentPath does for us is it enables us to enter a completely new market to us and that is this I/O market place, so the URL Rent.com is very valuable, in particular in our relationship and partnership with Google to build great SCO around words that people tend to associate with renting a townhouse, a house or a condo or a walk-up unit in a property. So we'll use RentPath and rent.com in particular as a vehicle to enter this new, smaller property market in which we’re less than 1% penetrated right now. So that will be another helpful element to an acquisition there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead. 
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey, good afternoon guys. I appreciate you talking the question. Andy, when you look at STR and the revenue you're generating this year, I think you said on the call when you bought it that you ultimately can – that you can double the revenue growth there. When I look at the information services segment, this year STR looks like it might be down a little bit. I wonder if you can comment Andy or Scott on that and then sort of what that total segment growth should look like over time as STR ramps up? 
Scott Wheeler: Yeah, let me cover the numbers on that sector. What you're seeing, which has been the fuel under info services has been real-estate manager for the last couple years. You may recall that that is comprised of both subscription revenue and then when they took all those big orders over the last 18 months they had a bunch of implementation revenue.  Right now the implementation revenue is running down since we're past that wave, and the subscription revenue is growing. So underlying, we're expecting to see anywhere between 15% and 20% continued growth in information services sector after we get past that run off, which I think by the end of 2020 we will be, so that is sort of STR.  But when we look at STR on a standalone basis, on a global enterprise they are growing around this 10% year-over-year, similar to what it was doing just before we bought it, and as you pointed out, we expect we’ll be able to grow that revenue 20% or more. We’ll need the year to get the technology integration that Andy mentioned done and just start rolling out some of the new products in a more meaningful way and so post 2021 is when we’ll start to see that revenue ramp up, go higher in STR.  Now, keep in mind when that starts to happen and it's integrated into a CoStar Suite platform that those revenue growth will show up in CoStar Suite and not in info services. So info services will continue in this 15% to 20% growth range with real-estate manager, risk analytics and a few other businesses powering that over the longer term and STR will start growing above 10% to 20%, but that that will shift up into CoStar Suite. 
Andy Florance: So we’ve had a bit of time now to really get into the hood and work with the STR team, to really understand the opportunity better, and I think the product strategy is very clear and concise now.  So STR has built a fantastic company, focused intensely on their relationships with the major hoteliers around the world, as well as the accuracy clean list and privacy of the benchmarking and the quality of how they do the benchmarking.  And where there's a tremendous opportunity is to take a whole set of the spare tools that STR provides and pull them together into one seamless login, one interface, one system using a lot of technology that CoStar Group already has available to us, and also integrate that with the analytics, market analytics, market search functions, forecasting, property level data that CoStar Group has, put into one solution and you know as I look at that opportunity, I am very confident that when we go through that process, that technology path, we can produce a product that the customers will love, that will be an absolute next generation solution and hospitality information.  How and when we monetize that exactly will evolve, but if you build a great product, that it’s magnitude of order is more powerful and useful, it will pay off. But one just you know tactical thing is, we'll be able to sell to the non-hospitality world, analytic solutions for people trying to appraise property, buy and sell hotels, great quality market data and our CoStar sales force will be able to carry that product, and there is just a lot of people in the CoStar sales force, so with just a lot more bandwidth that is a doubling factor right there. But I feel very good about what we have right now there, but it’s just a lot work and we don’t mind that. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Mayank Tandon from Needham. Please go ahead. 
Kyle Peterson: Hey, good evening. It’s actually Kyle Peterson on for Mayank. Thanks for talking the questions. So it's great to hear about the LoopNet bookings, the momentum in 4Q; definitely impressive sequential growth there. I just want to see if you give us any color on kind of how the bookings momentum has been in January and February, just to kind of tease out, kind of how the momentum is – can you… 
Scott Wheeler: Hello, we lost our good friend Mayank.
Andy Florance: I think we knew where he was going. He wanted to know if we had any insights on the booking momentum in the first quarter. Unfortunately we can't talk about booking or booking momentum in the first quarter until our first quarter conference call, which will be the third week or fourth week of April, Tuesday evening 5:00 PM and we’ll be happy to update it then. Sorry, can't say much more than that. 
A - Scott Wheeler: Alright, I'm going to let the cat out of the bag, we didn’t sell in that. We did sell in that – we solid some in January and we are still selling stuff in February.  Okay, let's get our last question operator.
Operator: And our final question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Bill Warmington: Wow! Under the wire there. 
Andy Florance: Very, close. Hello Bill! 
Bill Warmington: How are you guys doing today?
Andy Florance: Great! How are you doing today? 
Bill Warmington: I'm doing okay, I'm doing okay. Is that the Andy, the operator Florance. Hey, I thought it was, I thought it was – so what's up? 54 minutes of prepared remarks. You can't come up with another six minutes of material of make it – round it out to an hour, what's up with that? 
Andy Florance: We are getting old. 
Bill Warmington: Alright, so a two part question if you will. So one is to ask if you could give us a little color on the sales incentives, specific sales incentives that you're giving for the LoopNet sales for us in 2020, a little color there; and then also if you could talk about how far you are from being able to actually score a lead for the Apartments owners and managers. 
Andy Florance: Okay. So in terms of how we incent the CoStar sales force on LoopNet production, I will take a shot at that. Its approximately 20% of their billing book, so whatever they've got billing in a given month they get approximately 20% of it. And they get an accelerator towards their rate that they earned on their CoStar side once they cross – I think it's 20,000 of monthly bookings and so that motivates them, that motivates them to quickly get to that base point.  And, I think it doesn't count towards Presidents Club and things like that, but it's enough, it's an interlinked systems that’s pretty attractive to them, and they'll be able to do quite well with it and as the do well, we’ll do well too.  And then the second question, it was not authorized to ask, but we'll answer it anyhow as we always do; leads scoring well. At this point we are – you know one of the elements that we initially pursued with the online leasing tools was the fact that we could do better lead scoring. I think that is a long term investment for us.  As we see more and more renters goes through our online application process and more and more people participate, we can help people understand right off the bat as they fill out their application, which other properties they are likely to qualify for or not qualify for. Just say, several at a time and help someone get to the right solution faster. And then you know that's sort of a win-direct way by educating the renter of scoring the leads coming in.  And untimely enough people are participating in this, especially as we meet the needs of millions of college students using off-campus partners and we try to bring these tools into that environment as students come out of university and began renting their first off-campus housing. We’ll build up a fair amount of information about those leads as they go into our clients’ inbox.  So the capabilities are there, but we're taking the long term on it. 
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue. Please continue. 
A - Andy Florance: Bill, do you want to get back in line?  With that we’ll end the conference call. Thank you very much for joining us. Next time we're hoping to get a 60 minute prepared remarks or maybe a 45 minute. Thank you very much. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CoStar Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, everyone joining by phone is in a listen-only or muted mode, and then later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rich Simonelli, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you, operator, and welcome to CoStar Group's third quarter 2019 conference call everyone. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, CoStar's CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I'd like to share some important facts. Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to those stated today in CoStar Group’s October 22, 2019, press release on our third quarter results and in company's outlook and then CoStar's filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call. CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance, are shown in detail in our press release issued today, along with definitions for these terms and they can also be found on the press release on our website, which is located at costargroup.com. As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color on our Investor Relations website. So, please refer to today's press release on how to access the replay of this call. Remember, one question, and if we have time permitting we'll re-queue. But I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andy Florance: Thank you, Rich. That was extremely well done.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you.
Andy Florance: Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's third quarter 2019 earnings call. CoStar Group's total revenue was $353 million in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 15% year-over-year. During the second quarter of 2019, CoStar Suite revenue moved through the $600 million annualized run rate mark. In the third quarter, Apartments.com moved past the $500 million annualized run rate mark and did so with a 20% year-over-year growth. This is outstanding sustained growth, considering we're in the six years – six year of owning Apartments.com. But we expect there's much more to come. Multifamily is a huge opportunity. We estimate that total addressable market multifamily is somewhere between $8 billion and $10 billion. This is four to five times bigger than we initially estimated the multifamily opportunity was when we entered the space in 2014. Net income for the third quarter 2019 was $79 million, an increase of 34% over net income of $59 million for the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA was very strong for the third quarter of 2019, coming in at $113 million, an increase of 24% versus EBITDA of $91 million for the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins moved to 37%, and we achieved 80% gross margin in the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to have over $1 billion in cash at year-end and no debt, even after the closing of the STR acquisition earlier today. We continue to show strong growth in profitability, while we continue to invest in the future growth of the company. I'm delighted with our ability to consistently deliver on both fronts. There's a massive opportunity in both the United States and abroad in information, analytics and marketing for commercial real estate. While I'm pleased that we are approaching $1.4 billion of revenue in 2020, we believe there are billions of dollars of opportunity not yet realized, so continued investment is optimal. We had another excellent sales quarter, generating $50 million in company-wide net bookings, and increased 27% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our average net new sales of $52.5 million per quarter year-to-date in 2019 is 32% higher than the comparable period in 2018 when the average net new sales per quarter was $39.8 million. On the multifamily side of the business, the larger sales force we deployed in 2018 has delivered in a big way. In fact, both CoStar Suite and Apartments.com sales team each achieved more than 30% growth in net new sales in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of last year. I'm optimistic that our sales levels will continue to be strong for the remainder of 2019, and can improve in 2020 as we are proactively increasing the size of our sales force, offering new products and services, and continue to grow share in our huge addressable market. We now have 280 field sales reps in production for CoStar Suite and LoopNet, and we look to add -- enter 2020 with about 300. In the third quarter of 2019, we identified and distributed list of 17,000 CRE owner as strong sales lease to our sales force. Each rep has a target owner list. We have been aggressively preparing our sales force to target and sale owners both LoopNet signature listings and more CoStar Suite. I'm pleased to announce that we closed on the acquisition today of STR for $450 million. Founded 1985, the STR team has created the global industry-leading benchmarks in analytics that are the primary information tools, hotel management investors rely on to monitor and optimize their assets. They provide the foundation for daily hotel and lodging pricing strategies. This is an extraordinary company that's a viable partner with the hotel industry. Ultimately, the cash flow intelligence STR provides is the fundamental value driver in the $3 trillion hospitality sector commercial real estate. The industry needs information to effectively develop finance appraise and transact hospitality properties. We are bringing together a leading provider of commercial real estate information, analytics and online marketplaces with the gold standard, global hospitality industry for premium performance benchmarking and revenue forecast. We are excited to add this world leader as an extent of the depth and reach of our comprehensive CoStar platform. STR aggregates data from over 65,000 hotels worldwide, representing 9 million guestrooms in over 180 countries. Hotels electronically submit their revenue and occupancy data to STR in a weekly basis. CoStar currently provides billing information on 80,000 hotels, 45,000 hotels sales comparables and 4,500 hotels currently offered for sale. We plan to integrate the STR day with CoStar to create exciting new products that provide hotel building data, aggregate income and occupancy information, sales comps and fore sale information. STR has expanded our global footprint. CoStar now has over 4,400 employees in 19 countries with over 600 working outside the United States.

And we look forward to continue to build on those core values in the next chapter Smith Travel's growth. CoStar has extensive experience, segregating and protecting highly confidential client information, such as accounting data, leases in lease abstractions, major deals and progress, payroll data and sensitive banking data. Integration of STR with the CoStar product will maintain absolute confidentiality while also allowing property owners, investors and service providers in the hospitality sector, a more holistic, aggregated view of industry at market levels. I've already had a chance to meet with the STR team in London. It's a great group. And tomorrow, I will be in Hendersonville, Tennessee to welcome hundreds of new employees to the CoStar team. I'm looking forward to working with our outstanding management team including: Amanda Hite, CEO, hello, Amanda; Elizabeth Winkle, Chief Strategy Officer; Robert Rosman, Managing Director and many other strong leaders as we get there. We believe that combining STR's superior hospitality service offering combined with the CoStar platform will benefit all industry participants as we work together to create valuable new and improved tools. I'm very pleased to report that one of the world's leading property companies, JLL has renewed its contract with CoStar with a five-year deal and a two-year renewal option. As you know, JLL recently completed its acquisition of HFF. Our contract for the combined entity is largely the two firms were paying individually since now all the brokers of JLL will add access to the National CoStar Suite data and analytics. We saw a similar phenomenon when Grubb & Ellis combined with Newmark Knight Frank confirming that consolidation of CRE can be beneficial to CoStar revenues, particularly when it combined and expense access to CoStar services. I want to update you on LoopNet where we are with that. Office buildings release have historically been remarketed from broker-to-broker via print brochures or email brochures. And owners seeking to lease up their building with higher broker would then distribute a few hundred flyers to other local brokers announcing the brokers' availability. The landlords' broker will generally affix a sign to the building announcing the space offered for lease. But that will only reach prospects who are already at the building. Given that some of this lease can be worth more than $150 million, this strikes me as a primitive way to market space. It's understandable in historical offline contacts as there are severe limits in the methods available to market office space. There could be tens of thousands of tenants within five miles of a typical office building availability with hundreds of thousands of potential decision influencers. Additionally, 20% or 40% of the tenants searching for space in the market are coming from outside that MSA. The size, distribution, and changing nature of the prospects have made them possible for owners to build effective direct mail or email marketing list. Ryan National TV, radio or newspaper campaigns for years so it takes the lease property is prohibitively expensive. Hence, the industry has relied on marketing through a double middleman model. On a $150 million lease an owner might pay $9 million in commissions, $7 million in free rank concessions, and $14 million in tenant improvements for a total marketing cost of $30 million. Even after investing that so much money, we estimate that office owners lose approximately $40 billion annually to excess vacancy. Smaller tenants occupy about 35% of U.S. office space, so most owners cannot pay a mortgage without them. Yet commission brokers are less motivated to pursue small deals. Therefore, owners rely on a double broker model face greater challenges marketing to small tenants. While WeWork has not being complete success, one of its growth drivers has been that it's mean massive unmet need for connecting smaller tenants to space. The Internet has created transformative opportunities to market commercial real estate online and LoopNet is fortunate to be a Ground Zero for that opportunity. LoopNet and its certain related sites are now generating 6.6 million unique visitors per month as reported by Google Analytics. This is a 16% year-over-year increase. No other CRE marketplace comes close to LoopNet. No other CRE website comes close to LoopNet. According to Hitwise, LoopNet has almost 2,000% more traffic than second most heavily trafficked website wework.com. For the 22,000 CRE keywords we prioritize, LoopNet holds the number one SEO position on Google, 86% of the time. The fact is that today millions of tenants look for office space online. We believe that LoopNet is the most effective way to market commercial space today because it offers unprecedented reach, strong frequency, and elevates the property's brand. We know LoopNet's effective marketing because tens of thousands of brokers pay to market to listings on LoopNet in order to reach tenants and users. We believe we can significantly expand the property's reach, frequency, and branding by sorting the top of LoopNet and CoStar just as we do in Apartments.com. This increases the ad size content and by repeating across our websites, it's growing net reach and frequency. We call these signature ads and we already can see they work. By tracing IP addresses, we can see major tenants viewing signature ads on LoopNet followed later by their brokers view in the same ads or content and CoStar, and then we see the tenants lease space in the property we believe that the tenant originally found on LoopNet. We see specific deals in the range of 0.5 million feet, so we see some huge deals this way. The owners of an office building have a much greater stake economic standard than the broker, so focusing our salesforce on selling these ads to owners directly in harmony with the brokers at price points about $2,500 a month. We have recently put in place more training incentives to drive sales for this goal. We have made great strides in improving the website over the past year to better fit our clients' branding goals. We have created richer content and signature listings including photography, reviews, bios, and graphics. The signature ads can have a hugely positive impact on marketing of building for as little as a few cents to a few dimes per square foot. When the owner already be investing $100 a foot in traditional cost and methods to lease up their space. So we're talking a point or two on additional cost to make the program more effective. We believe that marketing commercial real estate online will be a multibillion dollar opportunity. And that CoStar Group is well-positioned to capture major share of that opportunity. We expect that LoopNet will be a significant contributor to our 2020 sales growth. Turning to Apartments.com, Apartments.com is doing very well. Apartment's revenue is up 20% year-over-year. Net sales are up 30% year-over-year. And profit contribution has been growing rapidly as we continue to grow revenue. In July and August, the Apartments.com network reached an all-time high in unique visitors according to comScore. We had nearly 60 million visits in August 2019, an increase of eight million from August 2018. The Apartments.com network continues to pull further away from the competition by growing unique visitors, 10% year-over-year to $18.9 million in September, as reported by comScore. At the same time, RentPath saw a decrease of 4% in the same period. Our network had more than nine times the number of visits than Apartment List had and 2.6 times the visits that RentPath had. The Apartments.com network had more visitors than the Zillow Rental Network. We have just begun beta testing Apartments.com’s, digital tenant screening, lease documents and rent payment system. Our first two markets are Santa Monica and Atlanta. It's only been two weeks so it's still very early, but the initial reaction exceeds our expectations. 36% of the landlords who added our listing on Apartments.com in a test period, elected to use our digital leasing tools, really happy with that number. We've already begun processing applications, screening renters and executing leases and collecting rent payments. Some of the owner and comments have included. It shows me the level of overall quality of the specific tenant, especially compared to other potential tenants in terms of reliability, trustworthiness, responsible, et cetera. Another owner said, it was more thorough than what I was expecting. Another said, I thought it was user-friendly and takes a holistic approach, and covered every detail we needed, and was quick and easy to use for both myself and my potential tenant. Finally another owner said, very easy and fast. Some of the renter comments, really quite simple, one, application. It was much easier than expected. Another one, it was extremely simple and fell secure submitting my information. And finally, it was fairly easy. I think it's good that the comments are so short. We expect to continue rolling out the tools throughout the rest of the year and into next year. There are hundreds and thousands of mid-sized and smaller apartment communities that we're now successfully selling to. To fully capture this opportunity, we are significantly expanding our apartment sales force, by building 100-plus person team enrichment, focused on this middle market opportunity. I had a chance to meet with the first team of 17 reps and managers last week. It's a very promising, highly motivated group with excellent support from our Richmond technical and administrative infrastructure. I'm very excited about the growth prospects that expand sales force can deliver going forward. During last quarter's earnings call, we reported that we thought we could provide our advertisers with more value, enhance our competitive advantage and generate a good ROI with more aggressive marketing investment behind Apartments.com. On our last earnings quarter call, we announced that we are increasing our marketing spend for the second half of 2019 by $10 million. We did that. And we increased the investment in the third quarter alone. We have analyzed the results. And we've achieved our desired outcomes. Beginning in August, we roughly doubled our investment in certain categories of Google keywords. And not surprisingly, we more than doubled our apartment rental click share compared to other top listing services, moving from 32% click share to 67% click share according to Hitwise. During the same time period, RentPath click share plunged from 35% to 17%. RentPath had been making up for weak SEO by buying SEM traffic. During the trial, RentPath moved from having more click share than Apartments.com to having one-forth of Apartments.com's click share. Apartment List had 24% of click share before it began, and their share dropped in half to 12%. We've also increased the number of times we're in the number one position in Google by nearly 600%. During the trial, we appeared the top 4 Google SEM positions, 95% of the time in our targeted neighborhoods. Given the success of the trial, the only humane thing to do is to immediately suspend the trials and widely deploy the increased investment to help millions of additional renters find a great apartment soon. We plan to continue to sustain an elevated level of SEM spending in the fourth quarter. By the end of the year, we will have increased our SEM spend by a total of $20 million in 2019 over our initial budget at the beginning of the year. We acquire Apartments in 2014 and since then we've grown profitable revenue organically and acquisitively. We expect to achieve a 5-year compound annual growth rate of 38% based on our 2019 forecast. We have grown from serving just over 17,000 apartment communities to serving well over 50,000; in fact 52,000. And industry that has historically only monetized large -- apartment communities we’re very successfully selling marketing solutions to large, medium, small communities and even single-family rentals of which there are tens of millions. That shows this is a massive, massive opportunity. We are clearly in the lead position in the industry. We absolutely want across billion dollars of revenue Apartments.com soon and go well into the billions of dollars of revenue. Ultimately, we'd like to generate a billion plus of EBITDA from the apartment sector alone. In 2015, we showed our commitment to the industry with an unprecedented $100 million investment in the marketing Apartments.com with $100 million plus renters in the U.S. It was not initially very popular with everybody, but it clearly worked. It helped us grow our revenue from $85 million to $500 million. In the third quarter this year, we've have tested a more aggressive marketing investment and we like the returns. As we move into 2020, we plan to take Apartments.com to the next level again. We expect to increase our investment in marketing from approximately $150 million in 2019 to $250 million in 2020. That's a $100 million incremental increase in our marketing spend. This will bring our 2020 margin down, but we believe in the future, this investment will drive our revenue and margin of well beyond the investment we're making in 2020. Our $250 million 2020 Apartments.com marketing budget is expected to consists of much more aggressive search engine marketing, more aggressive TV and digital video marketing with the goal of moving our unaided awareness for the 26% to 33% range to the 50% plus unaided awareness range. We also plan to invest in marketing programs to support our digital leasing initiatives. Make hay, while the sun is shining. The sun is shining brightly and we intend to make a spectacular amount of pay. Have a legal update for you. On Xceligent, if you remember that, CoStar shareholders have invested billions of dollars to enable CoStar Group to build and acquire robust information systems in marketplaces that are invaluable to the commercial real estate industry. CoStar's ability to protect its intellectual property from misappropriation is a critical factor in our success. Over the course of those last several years, Xceligent as former officers and directors instructed contractors and employees to circumvent our security systems protecting CoStar Group's websites in order to steal an enormous fine intellectual property from CoStar Group. They repackage and sell that content as their own. This represented a fundamental threat to CoStar Group when we had to stop it. We relied on the protections of the U.S. copyright law in terms of use for website among other legal tools. We sued Xceligent and their contractors as a smokescreen Xceligent complained to the FTC and countersued complaining anticompetitive behavior. Based with an iron clad case against Xceligent for massive copyright infringement in November 2017, Xceligent's parent company DMGT returns investment Xceligent to zero after losing somewhere around $150 million investment of Xceligent. Xceligent was bankrupt. On the day DMGT announced the write-down, the loss of $150 million, its shares suffered a 23% drop, hitting a five-year low. I do not believe that DMGT was aware of scale of illicit things that Xceligent was doing. DMGT was just a string of investors and Xceligent over the course of the 20-plus years that lost millions, tens of millions or $100 million. We welcome the investigation including an audit authorized by the Federal Trade Commission to determine whether CoStar content was improperly add to Xceligent systems or vice versa. The massive investigation led by the FTC approved monitor conclude that Xceligent improperly derived, took nearly 38,500 images from CoStar's database. We believe this is a complete vindication of CoStar's allegation of Xceligent's unlawful activity. The Department of Justice appointed trustee to manage the now bankrupt the state of Xceligent. After the results, the FTC monitors investigation along with other overwhelming evidence of willful copyright infringement perpetrated by Xceligent under CEO, Doug Curry. The trustee has agreed to the entry of a judgment of $500 million against Xceligent in favor of CoStar Group for copyright infringement. This $500 million judgment would be the largest copyrighted image judgment in history and the third largest copyright judgment of any kind. The judgment is awaiting approval of the bankruptcy court overseeing Xceligent's bankruptcy and the court overseeing CoStar copyright suit. Because Xceligent is bankrupt and virtually without sellable assets, the total amount CoStar will recover under the judgment is only $10.75 million, which will be paid to us by Xceligent's insurers. Of course, I never put the word only in front of $10.75 million. The trustee has also agreed that Xceligent's countersuit against CoStar would be dismissed with prejudice. In connection with Xceligent's massive illegal operation, the directors and executives of Avion, Xceligent's foreign contractor in the Philippines have been charged and indicted on cyber crime charges brought by the Philippine prosecutors. In its paper that Philippine's DOJ stated, that Avion acted in concert with Xceligent management to commit the classic example of computer crime. In final judgment entered in Indian court in favor of CoStar, Xceligent's other foreign contractor Maxwell stated that it was misled by Xceligent, it’s executives and managers including Xceligent’s CEO, Doug Curry who personally visited the operation in India to supervise their work infringing CoStar's copyrights. Shortly after Xceligent's bankruptcy, Doug Curry started another competitive CRE, the information business called Intrepid that sales in the few weeks of launch. Apparently after that, Doug has started another CRE information business with several million dollars of funding from Moody's, a company you may have heard of. The scale of Xceligent's copyright infringement is unprecedented, sort of, history marker and CoStar Group is very grateful for the thorough efforts of the FTC appointed monitor in completing the massive audit of the copyright violations. I believe our investors will give us credit for aggressively defending their investment in CoStar against intellectual property theft. We have ultimately achieved favorable findings or judgments in this defense in federal court in the U.S., coming up on two in federal court, in court in India, before the Philippines Department of Justice, from the U.S. Department of Justice appointed trustee and monitor appointed by Federal Trade Commission, which sums up to five wins and zero losses in a pretty challenging case. A special thanks to our trial attorney Nick Boyle who did a fantastic job and entire teams at Williams & Connolly. Quick look at the commercial estate economy. Despite growing concerns around the economic outlook, commercial real estate activity continues to post-strong totals for leasing and investment volume. We believe this is justified given the sector's sound fundamentals. Vacancy rates remain near historic lows across all sectors and supply is generally limited. And the recent drop in treasury yields makes returns in commercial real estate, multifamily real estate all the more compelling. Investors may also view real estate as a defensive investment as trends in capital market and economic indicators have increased the probability of a near-term slowdown. In particularly, we note disruptions in trade, following manufacturing output and business investment, slowing demographic growth. Despite these headlines, however GDP growth and job gains have yet to show any meaningful slowdown and continue to support demand for commercial and multifamily real estate. The property markets apartment rent growth once again topped 3% nationally. We believe the on growing health of the apartment sector relates to the broad and growing shortage of housing in the United States. In particular, insufficient supply of new-for-sale housing units has limited homebuying and led to the unprecedented level of apartment demand. In response to this demand, the apartment construction has risen to levels not seen since the 1980s. CoStar tracked just over 300,000 units delivered over the past 12 months and we're tracking about 650,000 apartment units currently under construction. The large majority of these developers rely on the Apartments.com advertising platform to market those units. Investors continue to favor U.S. multifamily assets investment the sector's had a third quarter record this year topping $40 billion. In the office sector, leasing is consistently set new records despite single-digit vacancy rates and limited supply. Large tech firms have demand as they expand beyond their Bay Area and Seattle footprints. Rent growth however, has turned to just around 3%, well below typical gains in the past periods of expansion. Unlike past expansions however, suppliers limited less than 2% of the current inventory and concentrate a handful of markets. New York also stands out with 25 million square feet underway. We work – unfortunately we'll leave New York a little bit vulnerable since they're heavily constraint in New York, but we don't think it's a big issue. We believe that measured rankings and low supply risk in the office sector helped insulate the market from potential economic reversal, and our base case forecast calls for steady rankings. In industrial sector ongoing changes in how consumers shop continue to generate record levels of demand for industrial space, despite vacancy rates around 5%. Developers are responding a record amount of industrial space as under construction, but rent growth continues to post gains about 5% year-over-year. The best among major property types investment sectors on pace to set another record. Disruptions to trade post some risk to the sector, we expect fast growing demand for local distribution space to provide same-day delivery of goods will help offset any slowdown. In the retail sector, negative headlines around store closings in e-commerce obscures the sectors to curb fundamentals. We estimate retail vacancies are below 5%, the lowest across the property types and construction underway amounts to less than 1% of current stock. The surge in space has results in low leasing absorption levels by demand for retail space from grocers, discounters, fitness clubs and experience retail is offsetting move-outs from department stores and big-box retailers. We expect the record levels of activity in commercial and multifamily real estate to continue. We expect the demand for CoStar Group's products and services to grow as we help owners, lenders, brokers and investors, property managers make quality choices and realize successful outcomes in any economic environment. We continue to generate strong momentum in 2019, and make important investments. I'm extremely excited about the rest of the year as we continue to execute on our long-term vision within a great company. At this point, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler, and he will give you more detail on our earnings and our planned investments.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. Well said.
Andy Florance: Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: It probably didn't seem like we took a break this summer. The third quarter delivering another great financial outcome, while initiating and closing our acquisition of STR took less than 12 weeks, but who's counting. Well, Andy mentioned a number of highlights of our third quarter results, including our second consecutive quarter of net new bookings of $50 million or more. We also had strong double-digit revenue growth, 50% year-over-year, which by the way, its 10 straight quarters of revenue growth of 15% or more and for all of you EBITDA lovers out there, another fun fact over the trailing four quarters. We amassed over $500 million in adjusted EBITDA, that's $0.5 billion, certainly a significant achievements for all of us here at CoStar. So, starting-off with revenue, which came in above the midpoint of our guidance range for the third quarter at 15% and for the year, we expect consolidated revenue growth of approximately 16% to 17%. Looking at revenue performances by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was 12% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2018. Revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite expected to be approximately 13% for the full year of 2019. Revenue in our Information Services sector grew 11% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue growth of 19% year-over-year. As we get further past the lease accounting standard adoption dates, Real Estate Manager results include subscription revenue growth of 44% year-over-year in the third quarter, and the 20% drop in one-time implementation revenues. We expect Information Services revenue to grow at a rate of 20% to 21% on a year-over-year basis in 2019, which includes approximately $3 million to $4 million of STR revenue. More on our STR outlook a little later in the call. Multifamily revenue growth for the third quarter remained strong at 20% over the third quarter of 2018, the full year 2019 revenue growth for multifamily is expected in the 20% to 21% range. Commercial property and land revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2019. Our LoopNet marketplace, which represents approximately 75% of the revenue in the commercial property and land sector, has seen continued strong growth numbers, even as we repositioned LoopNet into the premium advertising solution for property owners. There's a lot of work going on behind the scenes to implement our plans for LoopNet, as Andy mentioned, and this includes discontinuation of certain legacy products and contracts that are not in line with our strategy. Excluding these one-time impacts of discontinued products and contracts, the third quarter revenue growth rate of LoopNet would have been over 20%. We expect year-over-year organic growth in the commercial property and land sector to be about 16% for the full year of 2019, and looking forward to stronger growth rates from LoopNet as we continue to build that sector of our company. Our gross margins came in at 80% in the third quarter of 2019, slightly increasing from 79% gross margins we achieved in the second quarter of 2019. This is the result of strong cost leverage. Our revenues increased $9 million from the third quarter of 2019 compared to the second quarter of 2019, but our cost of revenues remained relatively unchanged sequentially. We now expect overall gross margins of approximately 79% to 80% for the full year of 2019. Operating expenses of $187 million for the third quarter of 2019 were slightly below our estimates and down from the $197 million in the second quarter of 2019, as a result of seasonally slower marketing spend in the third quarter. As mentioned during our last financial update in July, we increased our planned levels of marketing spend in the third quarter, which we expect to continue through the end of the year. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $129 million represents an 18% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $110 million in the third quarter of 2018. It was approximately $2 million above the top end of our guidance range. Favorable personnel expenses were the main reason for the positive variance. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 37% is 80 basis points above the 36% margin we achieved in the third quarter of 2018. Net income in the third quarter of 2019 was $79 million, an increase of 34%, or $20 million compared to the Q3 of 2018. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%, reflecting benefits associated with our share-based payment transactions and R&D credits. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter increased 21% to $96 million compared to Q3 2018, or $2.61 per diluted share, includes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition expenses, some restructuring costs associated with the organizational changes in Apartments.com and research that we discussed last quarter. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include other discrete tax adjustment items. Cash and investment balances were approximately $1.4 billion as of September 30, 2019, up approximately $91 million since last quarter. And as you know, we closed on the STR acquisition today, so we expect our cash balance to be approximately $1 billion, somewhere around that at the end of 2019. Now let's take a look at some of our performance metrics for the quarter. We had another strong bookings quarter with net new sales of $50 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year for the third quarter. The sequential decline from the $59 million of bookings in the second quarter is a result of seasonal sales patterns, primarily in our online marketplace businesses. At the end of the third quarter, our salesforce totaled approximately 820 people, up about 40 people from last quarter and up almost 90 people from the third quarter of 2018. Most of this growth is in our commercial real estate sales team, which is focused on selling CoStar and LoopNet. We expect to continue growing the commercial real estate salesforce during the remainder of this year along with the ramp-up of our mid-market sales team in Apartments.com. Despite our sales team will grow to an approximate range from 880 to 890 by the end of 2019. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the third quarter 2019 was in line with the rate achieved in the second quarter of 2019 at 90%. The renewal rate for the quarter for customers who have been subscribers for 5 years or longer was 95%, also in line with the renewal rate of 95% in the second quarter of 2019. Subscription revenue on annual contracts now accounts for 82% of our revenue in the third quarter, up from 80% this time last year and flat compared to last quarter. I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2019 beginning with the outlook for the STR acquisition. We expect that STR will contribute between $3 million to $4 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. Our revenue estimate is impacted by the negative accounting effect of deferred revenue that was on STR's books at the time of acquisition. STR's deferred revenue balances are quite significant relative to other acquisitions we've completed in the recent past. This is because STR builds and collects the full year amount for annual subscriptions in the first quarter of the calendar year. This is a that I'm particularly quite fond of, but it does reduce the accounting revenue post acquisition. Similarly, our estimate of adjusted EBITDA for STR in the fourth quarter is negatively impacted by the accounting adjustments for deferred revenue, so all the impact of integration costs. We expect the negative impact to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 million to $6 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the acquisition. These estimated impacts to revenue adjusted EBITDA from the acquisition STR are included in the revised outlook for 2019. As we look towards 2020, the results for STR will continue to be affected by the negative accounting adjustments for deferred revenue.  For example, the current annual revenue run rate for STR of approximately $64 million would be reduced by an estimated $10 million of deferred revenue that carries over to 2020. This would result in a revenue outlook of approximately $55 million for STR in 2020 before any anticipated growth or integration changes. Similarly, the deferred revenue effects in 2020 flow through to the EBITDA for STR. We need time to develop the detailed plan for STR and the integration in 2020, but at this stage, we expect the acquisition to become accretive in the second half of the year and contribute positive EBITDA for 2020. Of course, these are all accounting results for STR, which in no way impact the economic attractiveness of combining CoStar and STR, which we've discussed previously. We continue to expect, as we said in the press release for the acquisition, that within the 3 to 4 years, our investments in new products and our focused on growth of the combined businesses will generate annual revenue growth above 20%, which is approximately 2 times STR's current growth rate and profit margins in line with CoStar's long-term goal of 40% plus adjusted EBITDA margins by 2023. Now I'll discuss the combined outlook for the company. We're raising our revenue outlook slightly to $1.385 billion to $1.391 billion for the full year of 2019 to include the estimated revenue from the STR acquisition. The outlook reflects revenue growth for the year between 16% and 17%. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 in the range of $360 million to $366 million, representing topline growth in the range of 14% to 16% for the quarter versus Q4 2018. We expect adjusted EBITDA be in the range of $494 million to $500 million for the full year of 2019, which is relatively unchanged from our previous guidance except for the inclusion of the estimated STR results mentioned previously. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 19% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin for the year of approximately 36%. Up approximately 70 basis points at the midpoint of the range compared to 2018, despite the negative short-term impacts of the STR acquisition. The fourth quarter of 2019 we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $129 million to $135 million. Included in our outlook for fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA are the impacts of STR acquisition along with the increased level of marketing spend for Apartments.com. As Andy discussed, we've seen outstanding results from the increased spend levels and expect to continue investing in Apartments.com marketing at the higher level. The net result, the fourth quarter up, considering other costs offsets, with an incremental spend of approximately $5 million to $6 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. In terms of earnings, we expect full year non-GAAP net income for diluted share of $9.90 to $10.02, based on 36.6 million shares. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share, in the range of $2.52 to $2.64, based on 36.7 million shares. Looking ahead, we believe that 2020 is the right time to increase our investment in marketing, to rapidly expand our multifamily business. Although, it's too early to provide detailed guidance for 2020, we expect overall adjusted EBITDA margins to decline by approximately 400 basis points in 2020, from the adjusted EBITDA margin outlook for 2019. In dollar terms, we will need to generate approximately $65 million of incremental profit to recover those 400 basis points. To put that in perspective, in 2019, we expect to add approximately $80 million of adjusted EBITDA. We believe that by increasing our marketing investment in 2020, the results in the form of increased revenue growth will improve our ability to reach our long-term goal of $3 billion as run rate revenue. And 40% plus adjusted EBITDA margins in 2020 to 2023. I'd like to add additional financial perspective to this investment, which is similar in size to the initial marketing investment we made, when we launched Apartments.com back in 2015. As many of you may recall, after we bought Apartments.com, we placed a big bet by investing $100 million in marketing, to go after what we believe at the time was a $2 billion addressable market opportunity. Looking at that now, it's hard to argue with the results, which indicate that this bet has clearly paid off. Since we launched Apartments.com, our multifamily revenues have grown from $160 million in 2015, to almost $500 million in 2019, an increase of 310%. During that same period, our annual Apartments marketing spend has grown from $130 million in 2015 to only $150 million in 2019. That's an increase of only 15% in total over four years. So revenue has grown 20 times faster than the marketing spend. I think that's pretty good leverage. Although, some might argue that we've actually underinvested in marketing, as we've grown this business. This year, as oppose to 2015, we are in a much stronger position to increase marketing spend, both operationally and financially than ever before, which increases our chance for even greater success. Our direct sales force is much larger and continues to deliver record sales level each year. Our site traffic leads the industry. Our data content is massive. And the addressable market opportunity that we see now is $8 billion to $10 billion, which is four to five times the size it was back in 2015. Also, back in 2015, our marketing costs represented 80% of the multifamily revenue. Now in 2019, they're only 30% of multifamily revenue. With this potential increase in our marketing budget of $100 million, we estimate that marketing would represent approximately 40% to 45% of multifamily revenue in 2020. CoStar is now big enough and growing fast enough to absorb investments of a size. If our growth continues in 2020 at the same rate as 2019, we could potentially add $200 million in revenue next year, which would be two times the potential increase in marketing. To summarize, now is the time to increase our multifamily investment. We believe the market opportunity is bigger and much easier to see them before. We have more assets at our disposal, and more experience to leverage these for success. Investment required is actually much smaller than before, relative to our size and scale. And we believe the returns will be bigger and faster, than in 2015. Overall, I believe our strong results and operational improvements have us well positioned for the fourth quarter and beyond. We're happy to have closed the STR deal so quickly. And once again, we want to welcome everybody at STR to the CoStar team. With that -- that was a mouthful -- we'll now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys.
Andy Florance: Hello, Brett.
Scott Wheeler: Hi, Brett.
Brett Huff: Scott, thank you for the sort of thoughts and justifications around the additional ad spend, that's super helpful. Can you just go through those -- go through that one more time for me? And then talk a little bit about, where does ad spend go from there? And Andy, you mentioned right after you guys did the first Apartments deals people are worried about it I think the worry was that, if this business in order to grow it require incrementally even more ad spend. Can you just give us your thoughts as you go forward that 20 times return is compelling, but just explain how you guys think about that long-term? Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: All right. Okay, Brett. Let me walk through that one more time so the financial perspectives around this thing. So, definitely we did the initial investment in marketing in 2015, $100 million. We had a report out that said that, the marketplace is $2 billion in size. And then, as you know, we worked through the large end of that marketplace. We've seen the opportunity in the mid-market, we've seen how the opportunity in the I/O large-scale market. And we know that, that estimate is now growing to between $8 billion to $10 billion opportunity. So, we think the $100 million to go after $2 billion, was a great move. We think the $100 million to go after the next $8 billion is an even better move. So, that was one important note. The other that -- the time when we made that investment, the total company multifamily was not nearly as bigger and stronger as we are now. So, we had $130 million marketing spend and that was 80% of the revenue. Clearly, we've grown that now to be almost $500 million in revenue and saw an incremental $100 million in spent against that fast-growing business. There's much lesser portion of the business, much less of a bigger bet. The other thing I think is important to notice is that, that we've now grown salesforce much bigger than it was before and produces a very high level. The site traffic has grown significantly. The amount of data we have, the amount of electronic feeds, all the strength of that site their to leverage into this next size of the market that will make that $100 million even much more effective they are like softening up the beach head before the troops all go in on the attack. And then I think when you look at just the ability the company now when we're growing as rapidly at $1.4 billion in revenue, we had couple of hundred million of revenue in year at our current growth rates. We've added over $110 million, $115 million in costs this year. So, adding investment in costs are just -- they are going to be bigger numbers, they scare people a bit, because they're big, but when you look at the relative size of the company, these are the best we should be making to keep increasing the scale and the growth on the topline. So, that's what I probably comment on. And let Andy add little more.
Andy Florance: Yeah. And Brett it -- it sort of, I express concern from the 2014 period where -- well, we have continuously invest -- increases these investments in marketing. One of the things that is unique about this industry is we are one of the only aggregators out there investing any material money into the industry. So, this is not something where we are doing it in a zero-sum game trying to keep-up with some other competitor. What we're doing is we're seeing that when people are aware of our products and services, they are tending to buy them and renew at a higher rate. And with an unaided awareness in the 20s to low 30s, there's still a lot of people who are not aware of the product and we want to make more people aware of the products and services that we can sell to more people. We also foresee this strategic advantage of investing ahead of the pack. We want to be -- we are confident and believe that we will be turning through a $1 billion revenue mark on Apartments at some point going beyond there. We want to be investing into that size of company not into what the industry was doing a couple of years ago. So, this is really driven by the fact that we now have much better numbers, metrics, ROI, analysis, SEM analysis. We have a good handle of what we can sell and who we can sell it to at what price points. And we just want to go capture the opportunity. It's a relatively small investment compared to what we think the upside game is. Some people think that there's a big opportunity in the Apartment sector. That would be one of us. And some people think there's not a big opportunity for apartment sector. But we believe there's a big one, so we're investing there. We're not being driven by an escalating tit for tat with a bunch of head-to-head competitors. We're not in a beer business or the car business or the insurance business, we're all alone in a multi-trillion dollar asset class. So we're pretty excited about, we think it's good.
Operator: And our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, guys. Good afternoon.
Andy Florance: Good afternoon, Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: Lots to absorb as usual. One of the things I think you touched on Andy in LoopNet is the changing behavior of commercial property owners and managers and more of a focus on online. What if you could provide a little texture around that, and why you think we’re at a tipping point and what specifically you're doing at LoopNet to capture that opportunity. May not get as much air time or attention as that at the big marketing spend in multi-family, but it sounds like a structural change in the market you're addressing?
Andy Florance: Yes, it is. So I've had the good fortune to spend a couple of decades in the industry, and I was there back in a completely offline side then you see it move into unsophisticated online where there was an area where online marketing commercial real estate meant that you save $0.55 on a staff when you send your flyers, a PDF to the brokers and staff. But really what's happened is we could see as clear as day is you look at the traffic coming into LoopNet, LoopNet's got 80 some percent share of the folks looking for commercial property coming through. And we through reverse IPs and through Google analytics, we can get an idea of who these folks are and they're pretty much the Fortune 100, they're Walmart, they're Amazon, it's McDonald's, that's all the major tenants, it’s the big law firms just like people are using the Internet and everything from dating to buying a house, to buying a car, buying insurance. Everything they do, people are looking for commercial real estate. And they should not -- Facebook is a client of ours, it should not surprise anybody that Facebook goes on the Internet to look for commercial space, right? But it does surprise the industry, because the industry is trying to figure out is locked into a historical marketing mindset of you can't market to end users. There’s just too many of them. And it's just not possible in traditional methods to do it. But the whole digital folks searching out on the Internet rather than you going out and try to market to them, they come to you, and we’re producing the tools where the owners could be visible when they come looking for them. So I'm very bullish on it. I think it is just an identifiable mathematical certainty that it's occurring, but -- and so we're going to push that and we’re going to create awareness with folks how it’s happening. And I think it’s pretty interesting opportunity, because the broker, broker models pretty good at the 30,000 foot, 50,000 foot size, but it doesn't work so well when you get below 10,000 feet, and that's where the majority of transactions are. So we're going to push on it. We're going to see, I believe, we'll see success in it, and I'm pretty excited about it. But it doesn't happen overnight. We're rebuilding LoopNet. We can see it when you go look at the site, you can look at some office buildings for lease and at certain stage, you'll see that we're no longer presenting the data like to simply Craigslist where you're just presenting raw data. We're now paying attention to how the buildings are branded online and the image they present, and the image of the architect, the image of the owner, the image of the brokers. And so we're not just presenting them. We're controlling the kind of frequency they get by controlling where they sort, the size of placard, we’re controlling the branding, the reach. And so I think we're producing what will be the most powerful marketing tools the industry has ever seen, and I think it’s going to be exciting revenue opportunity. And it’s pretty much I think about it half a day.
Operator: Thanks. We'll go to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: So congratulations on closing the STR deal.
Andy Florance: Thank you very much, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So the question I have for you is on LoopNet. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the pricing asset being applied to the real estate brokers and then the pricing as it applies to the owners. And you gave the -- an update on the TAM for multifamily at 8 billion to 10 billion. I was hoping we could get an update on LoopNet TAM as well?
Andy Florance: Yes. So the -- again the way LoopNet was historically marketed. It was geared to brokers just because LoopNet one of the standalone company had no Research Department and needed to get content via the broker ads. So they would sell buckets of ads to brokers at super low prices. Brokers have a relatively small economic interest in the transactions. They typically -- the LoopNet as were purchased by broker who was pooling 1.5% of the economics themselves. And unlike in honor, the actual price achieved and the sale or a lease transaction isn't nearly as leverage for the broker as it is for the owner. So brokers have small budgets. Remember when we first picked up LoopNet part of the average ad price was $6 a building. We are now seeing owners who have 95% of deal economics, and who are willing to pay the sort of the top have walked -- videos of walked in building, want to pay for drone videos, willing to pay for larger placards. Those folks are willing to pay price points at 5,000, 6,000. Remember, we were selling ads to owners and print were up to 12,000 up to 50,000 a building. So we're just – we’re migrating and it's not something we're doing in conflict with the brokers. The brokers like what we're doing because the brokers get promoted since they're the ones representing this building. So the owners paying to promote their building get broader reach for the building and frequency in exposure and branding and that also carries that list brokers too. So it's sort of fun when you can be raising prices by shifting to a different segment with a different value proposition for what you're producing and not alienating anybody. So that's what we're doing. In terms of the TAM, we haven't really recalculated that but we're at – we are under 200 million now on that. We were roughly about 160 million and the last calculated on this was between 2 billion and 2.5 billion -- top of the envelope version. So we haven’t updated that lightly, but as we get further into the selling and we see the take rates and the full sales force behind the products that we launched over this next few months, we will probably be able to update that as we get into the – mid part of next year. And that's just looking at the marketing side of it. There's -- there are a number of things we perceive industry we find valuable, like reducing their workload in sub 2,000-foot leases. So we're comfortable that it's a pretty big TAM, and that we have a lead on it.
Operator: We have a question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. 
Andy Florance: Hi.
George Tong: You're planning to increase your Apartments.com marketing spend by $100 million in 2020, which amounts to about 600 basis points of margin headwind. You mentioned earlier that you expect margins to decline by about 400 basis points next year. So can you discuss where you expect positive margin offsets to confirm? Whether it's from productivity gains or cost cutting elsewhere in the business?
Andy Florance: Yes. There's a certain amount -- George that we'll spend each year. You know outside of marketing, it's natural to the business. Heads we've added this year. Salary increases those things. They'll go into next year, but they won't go as fast as these increases in marketing. So our forecast now looks at around 36% margin at the midpoint for 2019. So if you take into account extra $100 million in marketing and then the rest of those costs will say personal cost and related nearly will grow nearly as fast. And so that will provide a bit of an offset. So in the end of the day we'd expect to have about that 400 basis point drop off the 36 as a rough guide. Now obviously, they'll be some variety around that when we get into specific planning and we'll share that in February. But that's really where we are. We don't see there needs to be a bunch of cost cuts out there. It's more of – it’s managing after we've done a nice bit of investing this year, our cost base into next year.
Operator: Our next question will be from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. 
Pete Christiansen: Good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Andy, how can you -- it's obviously, a huge step up in marketing spend here, make sense to lean in at this time, but how can you ensure you get the right efficiency when you're trying to target the eye or independent owner category versus the broader category? How do you ensure that you get that efficiency? What's the strategy more like…
Andy Florance: That's a really good question, and that is right on target. It's something I think a lot about. And I sort of have a simple answer, which is, we're not targeting the I/O strategy. We are -- we can look -- we're targeting general awareness. We're targeting making sure that we're capturing increasing percentage in share of the renters hitting Internet, regardless whether they go to institutional property or to a low-end property. That creates value and it's hard to – and it's really not that easy to mess up on that. We have an experienced strong team on handling our SCM on Apartments. We have a good sense of what the good keywords are, good neighborhoods and the like. So, that one is a pretty safe investment. That's driving demand to our clients. Secondarily, we are -- we've broken open on this middle market opportunity. So we have gotten great penetration of the larger sized properties, really good institution at 100 unit plus to 200 unit plus, but we are selling 10,000 plus ads in an area that folks never really knew existed, which is the five units to 100 unit community. So, we are just trying to create general awareness for the person that's got a 30 unit apartment building, and softening the road for the hundreds of folks we got in the apartment sales force, selling exactly the same thing we've been selling successfully. So, it's just creating awareness in the same way for the same folks. Now as a derivative of that, it has a side benefit of supporting our I/O effort, because as they become aware of the site, you see that pickup rate where someone puts an apartment -- onto Apartments.com for lease. They select the renter tools. At this early stage, we're seeing 36% opt-in. So, just awareness -- general awareness of the site will support the I/O initiative. And when we run focused groups, we're getting positive feedback from both the renter and the small owner on what we're offering. We're getting extremely positive feedback from the renter. And so, our primary concern is just to make sure that we have a large pool of owners opting into the tools so that the renters can take advantage of them. So we're thinking a lot about it. A lot of it is very basic blocking and tackling, blocking and tackling of low risk and then what we're doing is we're fine tuning the messaging, creating awareness amongst the 300,000 folks with apartment buildings that we haven’t sold too, and we hope to sell to over the next couple of years. So lot of money.
Operator: And we'll go next to Ryan Tomasello with KBW. Your line is open.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi. Good evening, everyone. The revenue profile of the businesses is obviously, involve a lot over the past three years, and it seems like that will definitely continue to be the case as Apartments.com's reach, expands the prospect for LoopNet owner initiative seems strong, and of course, the push into hospitality with STR. So Andy, I was hoping you could provide us with your updated thoughts on the resiliency of the business model through a downturn as these new businesses grow? And how your efforts to manage the revenue quality of the business are perhaps governing your decisions with respect to new investments across the CoStar platform?
Andy Florance: Sure. So, I mean, it's an important question. We are obviously, in a very mature cycle. I went through the market economics for CRE right now and they -- when you say they can’t get better, they get better. And then they get better. So we're not seeing any weakness in the CRE industry however, just common senses says that we’re not at the end of cycles. So, we -- one of the things I do like is that if you look at the CoStar information revenue stream, it is -- a lot of that revenue is now coming from banks and major owners. And when you go into a cycle, banks stepped up. They're buying typically. They don't reduce it. So, that is a stabilizing influence. And we are -- we continue having gone through 2008. We continue to discourage salespeople putting a lot of energy into plant, water and companies, and moving companies, and other companies that evaporate in the cycle. And we put effort into major owners, banks, investors, who tend to have more demand in the cycle. Now, we operated Showcase and we can observe LoopNet in a cycle. And there's a little bit of counter cyclicality there, where when you've got $150 million, but that looses a tenant, you're willing to spend thousands a month to try to replace that vacancy. And what we hear from people who have operated the apartment business through cycles is that, this is actually the worst cycle to be in, right. These are so low and, well, they can increase people's budgets, go up for marketing apartments. That makes sense. You do in a cycle get complete bankruptcies. But then, that's quickly followed by someone picking up the asset with an unlimited marketing budget, which is a wonderful thing to see. The STR revenue, we believe is very resilient. The renewal rates there are shockingly high. So we think there's some resilience there. And it's a basic operating metric being used by the hotels between their -- from their sales manager, general manager to the flags, brands and investors. It's something that is a utility. And it's not something that they have the optionality to shut off in a down cycle, even if -- unless they just simply don't exist anymore. So, we've done well in past cycles. We don't -- I think, we drop -- CoStar's sales drop 3% in 2008, which is remarkable, given the scope of it. And I think we're pretty diversified and pretty resilient when the next one comes. And there's the offsetting thought, which is, when you go into a cycle, it's a wonderful time to buy really good companies at a big discount, which we really look forward to.
Operator: We'll go next to Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening. I know that you give the margin guidance, but you could at least qualitatively talk about the revenue outlook for next year, just in the context of should we expect the growth to accelerate, given the investments or will that be more of a 2021 scenario? And then should we look at the 2019 growth rates across the different product lines, may be a baseline for 2020?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Thanks, Mayank. It's always a tricky spot and we're in the third quarter. We don't have our specific guidance ready to forecast or budget prepared for 2020. I alluded in my comments to continuing growth next year like we've seen this year, which certainly what we've been planning for and investing for. And we expect certainly with the increased investments in marketing to help underpin that. What we more look out was, we gave that 5-year outlook previously, and obviously, when you make a new marketing investment, you want to be sure that the business one can absorb it, make it invested effectively, and then the outcomes of that will get us more assurance that we'll hit those goals. And I think as we work through that exercise, you could see just by the scale of the business were now you can invest $100 million and you may take a bit of a margin drag on that. But with the size and the speed of our growth, you could recover that margin drag within a year and then go back on top of it quickly in the second year out. Now these are all financial models. They're not plans or budgets yet. So I don't want to get out ahead of ourselves on what that means. But we certainly expect that these investments will continue the growth rates where we are and we want them to move us forward into the mid-later part of next year and really see the benefits of them into 2021. And so we have to invest now to get that to happen. Hopefully, that helps, give you some direction on how we think about it.
Operator: Our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys.
Andy Florance: Good evening, Sterling.
Sterling Auty: Good evening. On the marketing, Andy, you've said the number of times that this actually is the tougher time of the multifamily cycle where occupancy rates are so high, vacancies are so low. So, is the incremental investment more tied to just where you think the competitive position is? So you can just take a disproportionate amount of market share because of the healthier competitors? And it's not about the cycle, or is it in preparation for to have vacancy rates rise in 2020 not only the competitive position but maybe get a little bit of a tailwind from the cycle as well?
Andy Florance: Sterling, it's -- the primary driver is not an upcoming sense of a cycle. Though that is true, you'd want to have greater awareness and broader share. It's more the first thing you said, which is, it's an open field. There is a clear massive transition from offline to online for the apartment industry. We're the leader and each time we gain more information about what the market looks like, we think it's bigger than we anticipated and we want to -- you use the word get disproportionate share, we don't believe in the word disproportionate share. We believe in the word a lot of share and nothing's disproportionate. We're just going to get a lot of share, and that we just think it's the -- relatively speaking it is a period or a time in the evolution of the industry where you can buy at the cheapest price you can possibly buy it. Just because no one's bidding for it really aggressively, no one's fighting for it really aggressively. We're, sort of, alone in this space right now, or we're not alone in this space right now, but people don't seem to be investing in it even though there's a lot of player's out there.
Operator: We have a question from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. It's actually Josh on for Stephen.
Andy Florance: Hey, Josh.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. Just want to get your quick thoughts on the delayed timeline of ASC 842? And how it might impact Real Estate Manager results for the rest of the year? And then is there anything else that you guys are watching that could act as a headwind or tailwind to the adoption of that product over the near-term? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: Yeah. Sure. The delay of the adoption certainly gives you a little bit of a trough now as people may back-off a bit. We think that will -- they will tick back-up next year when more of the requirements come in. The effect of that now is we believe we're losing that implementation revenue that the one-time that is going backwards. But it's nice to see the subscription piece still growing over 40%. So, we expect that will all moderate out in to the 15% to 20% growth range over time. And then, it's really the future growth for that business will be less dependent on the accounting teams, and what they do and more around how we integrate it with CoStar, and we provide more services and tools for their clients to use the rest of CoStar in managing their real estate portfolios. And that should fuel the growth of Real Estate Manager much longer and more effectively than the near-term effects of the accounting teams.
Rich Simonelli: Great. With that, I believe we have no more questions. And thank you very much for joining us for the third quarter earnings call. And we look forward to updating you on our progress at the year-end -- at year-end call in February.
Scott Wheeler: In February.
Rich Simonelli: It's a big thing. It's exciting.
Andy Florance: Happy holidays, everyone.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you, everyone, for joining us. And we won't see you until you're through Thanksgiving and the holidays, December holidays, Christmas, New Year's and everything else, but we'll see you soon.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. And you may now disconnect. Thank you.

Andy Florance: Thank you, Richard.
Rich Simonelli: You're welcome.
Andy Florance: Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's second quarter 2019 earnings call. In this, the week is the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 million landing, a slightly more impressive feat than our second quarter earnings, slightly. In the second quarter 2019, CoStar Group total revenue was $344 million, up 16% year-over-year. That's $7 million above the upper end of our guidance for the second quarter, so this is one of our biggest revenue beats. We had our best sales quarter ever, generating $59 million in the company-wide net new bookings, an increase of 32% year-over-year. The primary driver behind our exceptional sales result was a much better-than-expected Apartments.com sales. Apartments.com net new bookings alone increased 122% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2019. In each of the past three quarters, Apartments.com has beaten all prior sales records for a quarter, with the second quarter of 2019 and the first quarter, Apartments.com net sales bookings were up 44%. In my experience, there are very few times when you get the monthly sales close numbers and are stunned by how big the number is. And this was one of those quarters repeatedly. The Apartments.com sales team is performing exceptionally well, is operating at the highest productivity level we've ever achieved. We expect to reach $0.5 billion annualized revenue run rate milestone for Apartments.com next quarter. This is a major milestone for us, given that we purchased Apartments.com in 2014, with only $86 million of revenue there. From that point of acquisition five years ago to now, we have grown Apartments.com at over 40% compound annual growth rate. We believe that we have every opportunity to continue this exceptional growth rate. CoStar Suite revenue growth was strong and crossed the $600 million revenue run rate in the second quarter. We now have over 150,000 individual subscribers to CoStar Suite. Net new bookings were up 26% from Q1 of this year. Our core US CoStar Suite revenue growth of 3.5% and our year-over-year US CoStar Suite revenue growth of 15.1% are right in line with our 5-year averages. I find it valuable to look at the revenue generated by our core US sales force, our CoStar sales force, which is US CoStar Suite combined with LoopNet Premium Lister subscriptions. The quarter-over-quarter growth for this combination was 3.7% and the year-over-year was 15.7%. The 3.7% quarter-over-quarter growth rate is exactly our 5-year average. The year-over-year growth number is above the 5-year average of 15.5%. We are growing the CoStar sales force, which we believe will support future acceleration in bookings. We entered 2019 with 213 reps in production. We now have 262, and we hope to reach 300 reps selling CoStar and LoopNet by the end of the year. We hired approximately 50 additional sales reps that are going into production over the next three months. We believe that they will impact sales results about nine months after going into production. We saw strong sales of LoopNet Premium Lister product in the second quarter, with net new bookings up 46% quarter-over-quarter. Real Estate Manager net new bookings dropped 40% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year because the booking increases of the prior year had reached so high level of 400%. Overall, revenue growth was great for Real Estate Manager as total subscription revenue climbed 75% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter. Net new bookings for our land business was up 27% quarter-over-quarter and net new bookings for our business for sale marketplaces was up 36% quarter-over-quarter. It's important not to overlook the tremendous value of these smaller or mid-sized businesses CoStar Real Estate Manager lands and BizBuySell. This quarter five years ago, those three businesses combined had annualized revenue of $28 million. This quarter, they combined annualized revenue of $108 million. They have grown at a really impressive compound annual growth rate of 31% for five years. They're very profitable, and they have more than seven times or eight times the revenue that CoStar had in total the year we went public. We continue to focus on prioritizing and selling subscription-based services with high renewal rates over selling one-off services with non-reoccurring revenue. Subscription-based revenue has grown to comprise 82% of our overall revenue. As of the second quarter 2019, our trailing 12-month subscription revenue grew 25% year-over-year, which is faster than our revenue growth overall. And for the first time, we crossed a billion dollars of subscription revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to show strong growth in profitability. Net income for the second quarter 2019 was $63 million, an increase of 44% over net income of $44 million for the second quarter of 2018. EBITDA for the second quarter was $94 million, an increase of 45% versus EBITDA of $64 million for the second quarter of 2018. With strong cash flow, our balance sheet is stronger than ever, with $1.3 billion in cash and no debt. As reported by comScore, Apartments.com continues to pull further away from the competition as we increase our industry-leading position among Internet listing services by achieving all-time highs in unique visitors and number of visits. In the second quarter, the Apartments.com network had 175 million visits, up 21% year-over-year. The huge renter traffic we have built there is very valuable, particularly the clients with newly construct properties in the lease-up phase. Today, 70% of apartments that have delivered in the last two years are advertising with us. But some properties need more exposure and are willing to pay an additional fee to soar even higher up on our site to get more leads. To meet this demand, we have recently begun selling a new higher tiered advertising level called Diamond Plus, very creative naming. This ad package guarantees the advertiser placement in the top three search results in a given submarket. In the second quarter, we sold $6 million in Diamond Plus ads at an average of approximately 3,600 per month, with apartment communities in some markets paying as much as $7,500 per month. That's a new exciting price point for us. This stands in sharp contrast with our primary competitor, RentPath, who began advertising $99 a month ads if you bought [ph] social media with them. That price is 175th of our Diamond Plus price point. I think that tells you everything you need to know about the competitive landscape. Given the success of our Diamond Plus offering, we have decided to introduce a plus option in each of our platinum, gold and silver categories. We plan to offer the plus ads at fixed price with little to no discounting. In June, we purchased Off Campus Partners, a leading online multifamily marketplace service for student housing in the United States. There are over 17 million college students in need of housing near universities and they're paying approximately $100 billion in rent annually. Often their parents assist with these rent payments. We believe Apartments.com has a unique opportunity to develop a long lasting connection with students as they move into other stages in their lives to become renters Off Campus. Off Campus Partners enters into exclusive subscription agreements with universities to provide an Off-Campus housing listing service used by students, parents, faculty and staff. Currently, it has existing contracts with approximately 130 universities servicing over two million Off-Campus students. These units of university partners include the likes of University of Michigan, Harvard, VCU, Clemson, Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania and most importantly of all, an exceptional University Princeton. We believe that this massive market with tremendous opportunities for us to partner with more universities and attract more advertisers, especially small independent owners. The majority of Off Campus Partners' advertisers are independent owners who are excellent candidates for our new online leasing features such as screening applications, digital leases and payments, which we plan to offer next quarter on Apartments.com. We are also planning to release a student housing upgrade to our CoStar multifamily analytic solution. We believe this additional information will be very valuable to student housing, investors, property managers, lenders and developers. We had a strong Apartments.com sales success at the National Apartment Association Annual Conference in Denver this year held in May. It was attended by over 10,000 property managers who are our prime targets and prospects and clients. Once again, Apartments.com was front and center with an amazing presence, and we attracted more than 4,000 visitors to our booth. The Apartments.com sales force met with 916 property managers over the course of the two-day conference in Denver. As I mentioned, we bought Apartments.com in 2014, we had approximately 17,000 paying properties. Nearly 90% of those properties were from communities of 100 units or more. Today, we have just over 50,000 paying communities and nearly 13,500 of those properties are in a smaller 1 unit to 99 unit property size range. We have successfully grown our annual multifamily revenue from $86 million in 2014 to a run rate that we expect to reach $500 million later this year. During that time, we increased our penetration rate in the market six-fold from 2% to approximately 12%, or an average penetration growth of about 200 basis points per year. This has truly been an amazing success story as we lead the industry in revenue, lead generation for our clients and traffic. In the last 18 months, our Apartments.com sales have been accelerating as we added more salespeople. From the beginning of 2018 to today, we went from roughly 220 Apartments.com sales reps to 265, a 20% increase that generate a staggering 122% increase in net bookings year-over-year in the second quarter. This sales force is on fire and they have set all-time high bookings in the last three quarters in a row. We want to build on that incredible momentum, and plan to reinvest some of our outstanding performance or our outperformance back into the business to capture more market share more rapidly. With the current size of the Apartments.com sales force, they spend approximately 85% of their time with existing clients and only have about 15% of their time available to prospect for completely new clients. As a result, we estimate that our sales force has only made contact with 3.5% of our good new business prospects in the past 12 months. This means there are hundreds of thousands of apartment communities we could sell to that our sales team has not yet had the bandwidth to reach. We believe that we can dramatically increase our 12% penetration and add billions of revenue by among, other things, growing the sales force. It's obvious to us we need more salespeople, so we plan to add another 100 apartment salespeople into an outbound sales team based in Richmond, effectively increasing the size of our apartment sales team by nearly 40% to about 370 people. We do not believe this will require significantly more investment. We have offset most of the additional headcount costs by eliminating 120 researcher positions this month from Atlanta. Those researchers were community callers and were tasked with finding properties with availabilities that we would place on Apartments.com for free. They added tens of thousands of units a year. This was great for the property managers who didn't have to pay for these ads. Given the enormous amount of traffic on Apartments.com, these free ads which would serve below our paid ads would often generate more leads to these non-paying property managers, then those property managers would see from their paid ads on competing Internet listing sites. When we first relaunched Apartments.com, we needed to include this free content to draw renters in. But at this point, we have grown our content and traffic many times over and now no longer need to spend so much money giving valuable advertising away. We believe by adding 100 salespeople, we will add tens of thousands of paid community ads maintained by the advertisers rather than by researchers. In effect, we are exchanging researchers for salespeople and we think we'll end up with more data and more revenue. We believe the opportunity is gigantic. There are 345,000 mid-sized apartment properties in that 5 unit to 99 unit size range, and we estimate that we have less than 4% penetration in these properties. The opportunity is virtually untapped. The good news is that we've been successfully selling at this level, so there's a proven demand for our advertising solution. We feel the online leasing tools we plan to offer will further the appeal of Apartments.com to these mid-sized apartment communities. Intensified marketing is the second area where we intend to reinvest our outperformance back into Apartments.com in order to accelerate our market share capture. We see a clear path to providing even dramatically more lead flow into the industry than our competitors. And by doing so, we expect to achieve a compelling ROI and build a durable, long-term leadership position. Our primary competitors' balance sheet is the polar opposite of our balance sheet. RentPath has more than $0.5 billion of debt and is handcuffed with tens of millions of dollars in interest payments, so they do not have the ability to invest and to drive more lease for their clients the way we do. According to Debtwire, their first quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA cratered, as it dropped 34.5% and it underscored their liquidity pressures. Their second lien has been trading below $0.20 on a $1. Given roughly in a 11% coupon on that second lien, yielding about $0.11 a year, a likely go-way payment would be achieved in a default or bankruptcy from the first lien holders paying the second lien holders $0.05 to $0.10. And yes, there was some option value and number of people believe that the RentPath's second lien debt holders think there's about a year until RentPath could default, but who knows. But it seems like a good time to accelerate our investment in order to increase competitive pressure and capture more market share. LoopNet remains the clear number one site in commercial real estate for advertising properties for sale or for lease. In the second quarter, we averaged 5.8 million unique visitors per month, up 19% year-over-year. Historically, LoopNet has not materially monetized premium adds the way Apartments.com does. We're hard at work deploying to LoopNet a number of viable successful lessons we've learned from Apartments.com. We believe that in the future, these significant enhancements to LoopNet will allow us to dramatically accelerate our revenue growth there. We are making our premium, gold, platinum and diamond ads even more valuable. We're adding maps, demographic information, local transportation and more. We're also giving prominence and exclusivity to listing brokerage [ph] firm. Visually, we're featuring the premium ads with excellent photography, 3D walk-throughs and video. In addition to our efforts from our 160 field researchers who create visual content for LoopNet listings, we're in the process of adding a number of highly skilled professional architectural photographers who will bring these buildings to life in our ads. Our portfolio research team is helping to promote the LoopNet listings by adding original written content about the properties in the neighborhoods they're located. The landing pages continue to improve in functionality, appearance and content. We're adding content we believe will be valuable to LoopNet's target audience of tenants and small investors. You should head over to LoopNet in a few months as new enhancements roll-out over the course of the next year . I've been fortunate to witness first-hand an amazing transformation of the commercial real estate industry over the past 30 years. Digital marketing has moved from being virtually non-existent to being an absolutely essential necessity, a real critical part of selling or leasing properties. The good news for CoStar is that we own the most valuable digital real estate at the crossroads of commercial real estate and digital marketing. We have the largest audience of potential tenants, investors on LoopNet and the largest audience of brokers on CoStar. The commercial real estate professional needs to market their properties where this audience is. In the past, our researchers' primary value proposition to our clients was the information they gathered for them. While the data we gather is still the foundation of our business, the marketing opportunities our platform affords is becoming the prime value proposition we offer industry professionals. We used to reach out to brokers to collect most of our information. Now it's flipped and many brokers come online and bring listings to us. Brokers continue to adopt our CoStar Listing Manager tool, allowing them to update listings directly into the CoStar database. It has been nearly two years since we initiated Listing Manager and usage continues to increase. 52% of all spaces were added online by users in the second quarter 2019. We now have over 41,000 power users who are updating their listings monthly. CoStar Listening Managers are providing greater convenience to our clients and at a much lower cost to us than our historical data collection methods. Our move to Richmond has been an amazing success and is transforming how we collect and present data. We're having more collaborative and productive conversations with our clients. This increases the quality of our data immensely and builds stronger relationships with our users. As a result, one of the recent changes we've made in the research department is updating the researchers titles to better reflect our marketing focus and expertise. The researcher job title is now Marketing Research Advisor. Additionally, as we further establish Richmond as our marketing researcher headquarters, all East Coast research opportunities are being consolidated into our Richmond office. We believe this will lead to better collaboration and synergies among the research teams and significant cost savings. In addition, since the development teams that build our research systems are in Richmond, this consolidation creates more opportunities for our marketing, research and technology teams to work hand in hand to build the most efficient back-end systems. We believe this will also create additional career growth opportunities for our Marketing Research Advisors. As a result, we are relocating the 145 Marketing Research Advisor positions currently in Washington DC and the multifamily research positions in Atlanta, to Richmond. We will soon have close to 950 people based in Richmond. Commercial real estate activity continues to grow. Leasing volume and investment activity in the second quarter of 2019 rank among the strongest quarters on record. We believe the high level of interest to be justified given the sector's sound fundamentals. Vacancy rates are in the single digits across all sectors and supply remains limited. And compared to low prevailing interest rates, returns in commercial and multifamily real estate offer compelling relative value. The US economy, at large, set a post-war record in the second quarter of 2019, reaching 105 months of consecutive job growth. And recent data releases show ongoing strength. In turn, US commercial real estate has enjoyed 36 quarters of positive demand among the longest periods on record. In the property markets, apartment rent growth has accelerated once again, posting gains about 3%. We believe the ongoing health of the apartment sector relates to the broad and growing shortage of housing in the United States. In particular, insufficient supply of new-for-sale housing units has limited homebuying and led to the unprecedented level of apartment demand. In response to this demand, the apartment construction has risen to levels not seen since the 80s. CoStar tracked about 300,000 units delivered over the past 12 months and we're tracking nearly 675,000 apartment units under construction. The large majority of these developments rely on Apartments.com to market those units. In the office sector, the national vacancy rate has fallen below 10% for the first time since 2000. In spite of the limited space available, leasing has consistently set new records as the large tech firms continue to expand beyond their Silicon Valley and Seattle footprints. New office construction has been limited but impactful. Mega projects at Hudson Yards in New York, the Seaport in Boston, South of Market in San Francisco and the H Street NoMa quarter in DC and the West Loop in Chicago, have upended gateway markets and forced landlords of traditional CBD product to compete for signature tenants. As a result, rent growth has trended at just 2%, despite the single digit vacancy rates. This is not to turn investors. Deal volume last quarter could set a second quarter record. In the industrial sector, demand remains at historically high levels, driven by the ongoing trend among towards same-day delivery, which requires regional local distribution close to population centers. However, vacancy rates appear to have bottomed out mid-heavy supply and have edged higher from the 5% low. Rent growth continues to trend above 5%, and investment continues to favor the industrial sector in [indiscernible] for the development or redevelopment potential for infill product. Based on our property-level value estimates, we believe industrial prices rose by 7% year-by-year, leading all property types. In the retail sector, negative headlines around store closings in the shrinking share of brick-and-mortar sales obscures the sector's superb fundamentals. We estimate retail vacancies are below 5%, the lowest across the property types. And construction underway amounts to less than 1% of current stock, with the record levels of interest in commercial real estate and multifamily real estate to continue. To meet the complex needs of the industry, CoStar Group offers products and services designed to help owners, lenders, brokers, investors and property managers realize successful outcomes in any economic climate. We've had a tremendous start to 2019, with an exceptional second quarter. I'm extremely excited about the rest of this year as we continue to execute on our long-term vision within a great company. At this point, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler, who will among other things, hopefully reiterate that net income for the second quarter was $63 million, an increase of 44% over the second. Our balance sheet is strong with $1.3 million in cash and no debt. And very importantly that we had our best sales quarter ever, with $59 million in bookings. But what CoStar investors ever get tired of hearing about all of that?
Scott Wheeler: That's a great story. Thank you, Andy. We certainly didn't have a terrific first half of the year, but I am going to try not to repeat that our net income for the second quarter was $63 million, an increase of 44% over the second quarter of '18. I also will not say again that our balance sheet is stronger than ever, with $1.3 billion in cash and no debt. And I'm certainly not going to tell people that we just turned in our best sales quarter ever with $59 million in bookings. That's your job. So, let me start with our revenue performance by services. CoStar Suite revenue growth remained strong at 14% in the second quarter of 2019 versus second quarter of 2018. Revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite is expected to be in the 12% to 13% range for the full year of 2019, modest improvement over our expectations we told you last quarter. Revenue in Information Services grew 33% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue growth of 57% year-over-year. This includes both the subscription revenue growth of 75% that Andy mentioned and the one-time implementation revenue growth of 25% for new customer implementations. The first half 2019 growth of Real Estate Manager exceeded our expectations, as companies continued to implement our solutions for the new lease accounting standards. As we move further past the lease accounting standard adoption dates, we expect growth rates for Real Estate Manager to slow in total for the second half of the year, as subscription revenues continue to grow but one-time implementation revenues will decline. Information Services revenue is now expected to grow at a rate of 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis in 2019, which is 400 basis points above the growth rate range we indicated last quarter. Multifamily revenue growth for the second quarter remained strong at 15% over the second quarter of 2018, slightly higher than our expectations. As mentioned last quarter, we expected a lower growth rate in the second quarter as we have fully lapped the anniversary date of our ForRent acquisition and we have a negative effect of certain duplicative revenues and discontinued products from ForRent that were evident in our 2018 results. With the strong sales results this quarter, I'm increasingly confident that the multifamily revenue growth rates in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 will meet or exceed 20%. The full year 2019 revenue growth rates for multifamily is expected in the 20% to 21% range. Commercial property and land revenue grew 16% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2019. All of our marketplace businesses including LoopNet, lands and business for sale are delivering solid growth in the mid to upper teens, which we expect to continue and increase in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we expect year-over-year organic growth in commercial property and land in the 17% to 19% range for 2019. Gross margins came in at 79% in the second quarter of 2019, slightly increasing from 78% gross margins we achieved in the first quarter of 2019. This is a result of very strong cost leverage. Our revenues increased $15 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter, but our cost of revenue only increased $1 million sequentially. We now expect our overall gross margins of approximately 79% for the full year of 2019. Our operating expenses were $197 million for the second quarter of 2019, which was in line with our expectations, including the higher seasonal marketing spend we experienced in the second quarter. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $110 million represents a 29% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $85 million in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $8 million above the top end of our guidance range. Stronger revenue was the main driver of the positive variances. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margins of 32% is 220 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and 340 basis points above the 25.9% margin we achieved in the second quarter of 2018. Net income for the second quarter of 2019 of $63 million increased 44%, or $19 million compared to Q2 2018. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 21%, reflecting benefits associated with share-based payment transactions and R&D credits. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter increased 35% to $82 million, or $2.23 per diluted share and includes adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and some restructuring costs associated with the organizational changes in Apartments.com and research that Andy mentioned. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include discrete items such as the impact of the share-based payment transactions. We acquired Off Campus Partners in June for approximately $16 million subject to standard post-closing adjustments. We're currently working our product integration plans with Apartments.com as well as business and financial integrations. Although strategically important, the impact of the acquisition to our financial statements for 2019 is not material. Now, we'll look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. As Andy noted, we absolutely crushed it in sales this quarter, with net new sales of $59 million. That's for Andy to talk about. This was exceptionally strong in multifamily. Also contributing to the big sales numbers this quarter were our two biggest industry conferences of the year, the ICSC Real Estate Conference and the NCAA Apartments Conference, both were in the second quarter. As you know, we don't provide guidance on future sales, given seasonal and other fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but we're very focused on reinvesting for long-term sales and revenue growth. Suffice it to say, we're very happy with the sales results across the business and the direction in which we are heading. At the end of the second quarter of 2019, our sales force totaled approximately 779 people, reflecting growth in the CoStar Suite field sales force that we talked about last quarter. We expect to continue growing the CRE sales force this year, with the productivity of new sellers typically ramping up over the next nine months or so. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the second quarter of 2019 was in line with the same rate we achieved in the first quarter of 2019 at 90%. The renewal rate for the quarter for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 95%, slightly below the renewal rate of 96% in the first quarter. This is the first quarter that we've included multifamily 5-year subscribers, which is a reason for the modest dilution from Q1. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 82% of our revenue in the second quarter, up from 77% this time last year. The improvements are primarily the result of successfully migrating the ForRent customer base to our Apartments.com network, strong sales and annual contracts. I'll now discuss the outlook for the year and the third quarter of 2019. Based on the strong second quarter revenue and sales results, we are raising our revenue outlook for the year by $11 million at the midpoint to a range of $1.382 billion to $1.390 billion for the full year of 2019. This outlook reflects revenue growth for the year between 16% and 17%, up from the 15% to 16% we indicated last quarter. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2019 in the range of $350 million to $354 million, representing top line growth in the range of 15% to 16%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $498 million to $505 million for the full year of 2019, which is relatively unchanged from our previous guidance. As Andy discussed, exceptionally strong results and the market position of our multifamily business has us convinced that now is the time to reinvest increased revenue back into the business. [Indiscernible] we increased our marketing spend in the forecast for Apartments.com in the second half of 2019 by approximately $10 million. Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 20% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margins for the year of approximately 36%, up around 110 basis points in the midpoint of the range. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $123 million to $127 million. Margins are expected to increase sequentially in the third and the fourth quarters. In terms of earnings, we expect full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $10 to $10.14, based on 36.6 million shares. Certainly great to see the $10 per share numbers coming into view this year, which if achieved would present compounded EPS growth of over 30% per year since 2016. For the third quarter of 2019, we expect non-GAAP net income to diluted share in a range of $2.44 to $2.52, based on 36.6 million shares. Overall, our CoStar team delivered a phenomenal first half of 2019. We're very well positioned to continue our strong revenue growth trajectory, to increase the level of growth investments for the future and continue to expand margins. With that, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. And Rich, you are right about that replay. I had a question about the -- Andy, I think you were talking about, there is a portion of the Apartments.com network that is getting free ads, that is shutting off now, obviously, because of the success you've had on driving lead growth. Has that happened? Is that going to happen? And then when is that going to happen? What's the timeline? And what are you kind of expecting for those free ads turning into paid ads?
Andy Florance: So it's happening in phases. Some of it has happened. When we first relaunched, we were running free ads for communities at all sizes on, up to 250 units, be it [indiscernible] properties over 100 units. And as we started building up more and more content and more and more traffic, we started eliminating free ads above 200 units at above 150 units, at 100 units. And we just keep on bringing that level down. And as we do that, a significant number of those folks decide to go ahead and sign-up for Apartments.com and not lose that lead flow. So the communities below 100 units, that will roll out over the course of the remainder of the year and we will be trying to build up that inside sales force fast quickly enough to be able to pursue the leads that, that generates. So it will be flexible, but it will be six months to 12 months to eliminate the freeze below 100. Now we won't -- we will continue to carry the very small communities for free for quite some time. So the condo for rent, to the house for rent, the real small stuff. And I also want to reiterate that our second quarter had $59 million in bookings.
Operator: And our next question is from Brett [ph] with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Brett.
Unidentified Analyst: Great to see the bookings power that can be generated. I know that this had some real positives in the conferences and things like that helping. But one of the questions we get a lot is, as we look forward, the bookings should kind of trend higher. They've been kind of around the $50 million range, up until this quarter. As you look out in order to sort of think about supporting the growth rate that you guys have talked about over your long-term guidance, the Street is sort of baked in what looks to be, you need maybe $65 million or so a quarter starting sometime next year in order to drive the kind of revenue in the out years. How should we think about the sustainability of this $59 million number? Or should we expect it to come down a little bit because it was particularly good? And then just continue to rise. And if it rises, can you tell us what the drivers of that? Because I know some sales, some pricing, give us some sort of view into how those bookings probably rise over time? Thank you.
Andy Florance: Sure. So, I'm very excited about the Street expectations for bookings in the 60s next year, and I look forward to those earnings calls. It will be exciting. And we will repeat successful results throughout the earnings call. But the -- there are a number of different things that give you tailwinds as you go in to try to achieve those higher numbers. Like, we obviously don't know small fluctuation nuances from quarter-to-quarter. So the bookings next quarter, it could go up a little bit, it could go down a little bit. And it's not necessarily terribly material, which way it goes of slight increments. But the trend, I feel comfortable with expectations that it goes up. Again, growing the CoStar sales force materially, yes, it is a big driver. There is no shortage of opportunity. So, penetration rates for the advertising on LoopNet, new products in LoopNet, taking owner product out there, new multifamily product, student housing, analytics on the CoStar side, a lot of opportunity there. Adding a 100 salespeople to Apartments.com, the expectation is that they would sell something and that would also drive the opportunity. And as we increase the marketing, we will increase the lead flow. And then looking at the numbers, our ability to successfully sell product to 200 unit communities, 100 unit communities, 75 unit communities, 50 unit communities, 40 unit communities, 30 unit communities, 10 unit communities, means that we've got a huge marketplace to sell to, and adding additional salespeople is going to give us that ability to go address that opportunity. And then the land business, the BizBuySell business and CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to hit on all cylinders. So, there is a lot of good tailwinds there and so we're not really shy of those expectations next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone. So, I wanted to ask on the apartment side. If you could talk a little bit about the end-to-end digital solutions for the small landlords. Specifically, what services you're going to be providing there? The beta testing, how is that going and then what will the Q4 roll-out look like?
Andy Florance: Thank you, Bill. So, we're -- I'm actually on my way up to -- I'm just in from Tokyo, if you can't tell that I'm a little jet lagged. Heading up to Chicago for focus groups on that over the next couple of days, we're going to be interviewing small landlords tenants on that whole new products. So, that new product is providing an end-to-end leasing solution within Apartments.com, where someone marking their property at Apartments.com can elect for online leasing, which means renters can apply directly, digitally using our applications on Apartments.com for an apartment. We screen them for credit, criminal and prior evictions. If the landlord wants to move forward with the tenant and wants to move forward, they can enter into a digital lease on Apartments.com and then we can facilitate the rent payments on Apartments.com. We believe this will be particularly appealing to the smaller landlords that don't have these sorts of solutions. We also think it will be appealing to the renters because our price points for doing an online application is typically half of what the normal fees are and we are providing portability to the applications. So, a renter who applies to one property on Apartments.com can use that same application nearly instantly for any other community within 30 days. So, it's pretty exciting and we are going to be looking at how that reaction is going. But it's early. We're just rolling it out this quarter. We'll know more after the focus groups. But one of the things that I'm -- we're looking at now is we think it will have a big impact not just on the folks running a single house or condo, but we think it will be really helpful in helping us to sell more advertising to the middle-market, the folks with 20 units, 40 units, 50 units. And that will be sold through our inside -- the new inside sales force where they'll be really aggressively going after that sector. So it's -- it's rolling out in four, I think we added one more markets. I think it's rolling in five markets in the third quarter. And based on that, we will gear it up to additional markets in the fourth quarter, but we haven't really finalized how many. And one of the things we want to do is build up that inside sales team. So, we really focus our energy on the markets we're rolling it out in intensely, so that the -- there is enough people participating in the program that, that renter application portability between multiple communities has enough scale and mass that's particularly valuable. But we will tell you more -- we'll report in on the third quarter call. On the year-end call, we'll have more color on it. It's still little early. But man, it was a lot of work.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Thanks, good afternoon. Commercial property and land revenue growth in the quarter decelerated to 16% year-over-year from 17% in 1Q despite easier year-ago comps. Can you discuss reasons for this moderation and maybe elaborate on your efforts to go after the institutional customer channel at LoopNet marketplace?
Scott Wheeler: So the -- so the sales outlook, George, is still strong for the LoopNet business. The differences you're talking about, we only moved the forecast to $1 million or $2 million in any quarter and you get a percent change on this business because the numbers aren't really that big. What we're still seeing is really good sales through the CoStar sales force or LoopNet, and Andy mentioned some of these Premium Lister sales that we're getting. And we continue to sell the signature ads. You get different fluctuations in cancels from quarter-to-quarter, which sometimes does get a little higher or then they back off. So depending on the timing of those, we tweak the forecast and tend to take a more cautious approach going out. But we're still very positive about the changes we're making and how that sales force can create momentum in the second half.
Andy Florance: Also, our big initiative there, which is really the premium gold, platinum and diamond levels, has not effectively rolled out and that will be coming in the next couple of quarters. So, we're having a big conference pulling together. Our senior sales leaders are beginning to walk through the sales process for selling those Apartments.com like ads on LoopNet. And you're not seeing any revenue associated with that right now and that's a future revenue stream, so there will be upside.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tom -- I'm sorry, Ryan [ph] with KBW. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question today. Andy, just in terms of LoopNet rebranding on your recent comment and the owner focus, can you give us some color on what the go-to-market strategy will be in the education process? Will this be more of a gradual education process, or are you targeting more of a focus launch. And if so, do you think that the sales force is rightsized following the year-to-date growth? And if there are perhaps any efficiencies in partnering with your existing broker clients for a sales effort to align interest and more quickly reach this very valuable owner client?
Andy Florance: Sure. So, one of the things I did not mention, going into detail on was, we have been reorganizing the CoStar sales force a bit in order to get ready for selling these premier LoopNet owner-oriented ads, the sort of upper end ads. And what we've done is, we've identified about 65 sales people across our network, who are the more senior folks and were assigning the top owner prospects to them. We're pulling them together for a couple of days of training. So far we haven't really -- we haven't done that. We're just beginning that process. It's relatively straightforward. The value proposition is pretty straightforward. And I think that we will get adoption or the sales force will pick, the specialist salespeople will pick this up pretty quickly and we really be relying on them to take that forward. I would expect that over time with success there, we'll feel that 65 is not quite the right number and we'll probably want to grow that team a little bit. But I think we'll take one step at a time. A little bit of success with the 65 people would be a lot of success to our bookings numbers. The second part that you mentioned there about partnering with our broker clients is exciting. In the past, we have partnered with our broker clients to basically wholesale or resell advertising to their owner clients and allow them to offer discounts and give them some rebates for volume. And we've had some discussions with some of our brokerage clients about allowing them to resell those LoopNet ads owners. It's a win-win for everybody, the broker, the owner and us. And it is similar to what happens with Apartments.com. So, often when we're selling an advertisement for an apartment community, Greystar, Greystar is acting on behalf of an owner who we don't really know who they are. But they're just authorized to make the purchase and Greystar through volume gets a better price for their owner. So, we'd be looking for the same thing to happen in CoStar, LoopNet, but it will be something that would be happening next year. But we've gotten really positive feedback from folks like CBRE and some others on that opportunity. And it's not unprecedented. Again, not only on the Apartments.com side, but also CoStar Real Estate Manager where a lot of our sales there are -- is white labeling from folks like JLL and CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield, who basically steer their clients into CoStar Real Estate Manager.
Rich Simonelli: And thanks for joining us, Ryan. Glad to have you. Thanks for starting coverage.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Good afternoon. I missed that bookings number. So…
Andy Florance: It was $59 million.
Andrew Jeffrey: We'll get to the offline.
Andy Florance: Thank you for asking. Just under $60 million. So, we're not saying.
Andrew Jeffrey: Yes. In all seriousness, one of the things that strikes me is the success you've had building out your sales force without -- from we can tell from the outside looking at really sacrificing productivity. Can you speak a little bit about what the gating items are to continuing to build sales? I mean, we're in a full employment economy. These are not sort of simple products as I would think. It's a fairly sophisticated sale. I mean, kind of what's the secret sauce and what do you worry about in terms of being able to continually expand the sales organization?
Andy Florance: Well, for me, my primary concern is typically, we are an organization that changes a lot. So, as we -- we don't stay the same. Most sales organizations do exactly the same thing for 10 years in and out. They don't change a lot. Things like refocusing the sales team against the smaller communities to an online leasing, refocusing the info salespeople towards a new ad opportunity in the LoopNet side, that's a lot of change and that requires a big organization to adopt change. And that's just -- that's heavy lifting, that's probably our single biggest gating item. I was meeting with a couple of tech people yesterday. We were at CES and some other companies and they were talking about having challenges hiring salespeople. Knock on wood, we've been able to keep a really good pipeline of high-quality salespeople coming in the door and we have not seen problems with being able to find those folks. So, you can see that in the 50 plus recent hires on the CoStar side. And then I also -- we're going to be -- and hiring in Richmond. I feel confident there. We invest a lot into the Richmond marketplace. We have a big brand there and we've been successful in meeting our hiring requirements there. So, we're always looking to try to improve our sales training and try to give them more experiences and developing ongoing training. But we like the productivity numbers we're seeing, the productivity numbers per salesperson. Apartments.com is exceptional right now. And if we can keep that through -- going through an inside sales team, we'll be really happy with that result. So the main issue is just continuously reshaping the organization, things like dividing the Apartments and the CoStar teams into separate management lines. That's the main challenge.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks. This is actually Josh [ph] on for Stephen. Over the last few quarters, you guys have provided some helpful data points on the Apartments upsell and LoopNet 2.0. But I was hoping you could frame for us what you view is the bigger opportunity over the next two years or three years. And if there's time, what you see are kind of the main factors driving demand for the higher-priced ads in a high occupancy environment? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Yes. I would like -- and you ask, which of my children are my favorite and that's a tough one. So, I'd like to say that Apartments.com is awesome and LoopNet is awesome and they both have trends of upside. But you have to say, you have to respect Warren Buffett. And one bird in the hand is better than two in the bush. And Apartments.com is on fire right now and it's happening. What's driving demand for the up-sell, when you see folks adopting rapidly, price points at $3,600 and $7,500 a month where the average had been $770, what's going on there is we are just delivering the traffic and the lead flow. We've got massive traffic in lead flow. It's working. And we're hearing, like in a focus group, I was in two weeks or three weeks ago in Dallas, property managers who are building a lot of new -- putting a lot of new units out there are finding that everybody in say, Dallas Uptown is now buying our Diamond ad and it's hard to stand out. Like in -- they're looking to spend more to stand out more when they're in lease-up. And so with so many people buying in Apartments.com, people with higher demand are willing to pay more. And when you think about what's at stake for them as they launch a $200 million community in the lease-up, they don't really care if our ad cost a $1,000 or $10,000. They're in a nine-month lease-up period and we are the source for the majority of their communities. So, we've kept our -- frankly, we've kept our pricing very aggressive and our price per lease and our price per lead is very low. And they're very happy with it. And if they want more, they're willing to fork out money. So the upside is, we are -- these plus categories where within silver, gold, platinum and diamond, we're going to enable people to pay to sort higher within the categories, I think we will generate a lot of revenue. And then again just bringing out the online leasing tools and going after the mid-market will be big. LoopNet, I'm highly confident about, but it's -- it is still in development. It's still early days. But we're very familiar with everything about that LoopNet area and feel like it's a clear opportunity and remain very optimistic about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. And -- we really appreciate all the detail that you gave on the call. So, thank you very much. Quick question on the CoStar Suite. When you look at the growth year-over-year, how would you characterize? I know you gave us a rough estimate of the number of subscribers. But how much of that growth is coming from increases in user count versus maybe the best way to put it is increase in average revenue per subscriber?
Andy Florance: Most of it is new subscribers. There is a little bit more. There is a slight increase in average price point per user. So, we're getting -- we're being a little more thoughtful about looking at some of the dramatically underpriced accounts and bringing them up a little bit closer, not all the way in the list, we are bringing up a little closer list. So, I'd say the shift is mixing -- the mix is shifting a little bit between price point. It's a little bit more of that than there has been in the past but nothing crazy. We're talking about instead of 3% average price increase, it might be 6% or 7%.
Sterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Joe Goodwin: Hi, this is Joe Goodwin on for Pat. Just a quick question. Andy, how's the environment for CoStar to do more M&A? Any commentary you can provide us there. And then I have another question after that.
Andy Florance: So the question was what does M&A environment look like? So, we're -- it's very active. There's a lot going on there. We are -- at any given point, we're looking closely at probably a dozen companies. We are being selective, continue to be selective. So if valuation doesn't appear to be rational to us, we're not doing any sloppy deals that way. But we do have a pipeline and we are working through it. And some of it is smaller deals like Off Campus Partners and then there is some -- there are some larger things in the pipeline. But again, they don't occur until they occur because we have a great track record across 20 acquisitions, 30 acquisitions of not having any big goose. And we will continue to be very careful as we go forward. But we're not going to change our ways of continuing to make good acquisitions.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Buck from B.Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Scott Buck: Good afternoon, guys. A bit of a follow-up there. I'm watching the cash balances continue to climb quarter after quarter, how are you prioritizing uses? And will we see at some point maybe some repurchase activity or a potential dividend? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Thanks, Scott. Our priorities right now are the acquisition pipeline that we just talked about, putting money back into organic spend as much as possible. Clearly, we're still going to generate net positive cash, but our intention is to put that back into acquisitions. We'd love to see some more rational price discussions in the marketplace on deals right now. But we know they're out there and they're big enough to use that cash. So, it's just a matter of time, I think we'll do that. Right now we're not considering any share buybacks or dividends as there is still so much opportunity in this growing digital marketplace transformation, that it is better to be holding it for some of the near-term and then using it when we have those opportunities.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Andy Florance: Great. Well, thank you all for joining us for the second quarter call and we look forward to getting together with you again in the third quarter. And thank you very much.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-23 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you standing by. And welcome to the CoStar First Quarter Financial Results Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead sir.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you very much operator and welcome to CoStar Group's first quarter 2019 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, our CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I'd like to share some very interesting and important items that could actually make your day. Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to those stated in CoStar Group's April 23, 2019 press release, on our first quarter earnings and our company outlook and in our CoStar filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent Q reports on Form 10-Qs under the heading fasters – Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call including non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and forward-looking non-GAAP items are shown in detail in our press release issued today along with definitions for those terms long definitions. The press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com. As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color on our new investment-improved Investor Relations website. Please refer to our press release today to how to access this call going forward. Remember, one question so make it a good one. And I'll now turn the call over to Andy.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Rich. So let's move to this call quickly so that we can all get to this long definitions of key financial terms in our press release. Thank you for joining us for CoStar Group's first quarter 2019 earnings call. It's just eight weeks ago that, we reported superb year-end results and we are pleased to be back so soon reporting another strong quarter with solid revenue growth and even stronger profitability growth. In the first quarter of 2019, CoStar Group total revenue was $320 million -- $328 million, up 20% year-over-year. We generated $55 million more revenue in the past quarter than we did in the same quarter one year ago. Apartments.com led the way with 30% year-over-year revenue growth. LoopNet's revenue increased 17% year-over-year. CoStar Suite revenue grew 13%, which was at the upper end of our guidance. Our rural lands marketplaces grew 21%, and our business-for-sale marketplace revenues grew 12% year-over-year. CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to be a tour de force and major contributor with 95% year-over-year revenue growth. With high incremental margin on each dollar sold, our strong revenue growth continues to translate into even higher earnings growth. In each of the last two quarters, we've generated the highest quarterly net income in our history. Net income increased to $85 million in the first quarter, up 63% from $52 million in the first quarter of 2018. We generated $113 million of EBITDA and $125 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. When annualized that's consistent with our expectations of generating $0.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2019. Our $55 million year-over-year increase in revenue in the quarter generated a $43 million year-over-year increase of EBITDA. Effectively 78% of – $0.78 of every incremental dollar sold translate into EBITDA. In the first quarter of 2019, adjusted EBITDA margin was 38%, an increase of 700 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018.  Company-wide net new bookings grew 36% year-over-year to $48 million in the first quarter of 2019. For the second consecutive quarter, Apartments.com generated our best bookings quarter ever as our sales force continues its strong momentum, with a 40% increase in net new bookings year-over-year. Last year, we communicated that our entire Apartments sales force was investing a significant amount of time and effort into the important job of converting the newly acquired ForRent contracts into Apartments network contracts. That investment yielded great results, but also meant that they have less time available to generate net new sales last year. Now that we have completed the ForRent conversion and have more time you can clearly see that the Apartments sales force's productivity is surging. These results are more impressive because of the quality of customer service, the Apartments sales force is delivering, while also delivering great sales numbers. During the first quarter of 2019, the Apartments.com sales force conducted 80,000 sales meetings and earned an audited Net Promoter Recommendation Score of 9.8 out of 10. That is clearly outstanding customer satisfaction. LoopNet net bookings were up 27% in the first quarter of 2019 over Q1 of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we achieved record CoStar sales results when thousands of stranded Xceligent clients rapidly migrated to CoStar. Not surprisingly, while CoStar sales were strong in this quarter, they didn't -- the bookings did not rise over the Q1 2018 exceptional high watermark. We have grown the CoStar sales force by 6% from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. We intend to continue to grow the CoStar sales force by approximately 30% overall from Q4, 2018 to Q4, 2019. We have a robust product pipeline for CoStar, CoStar Analytics and the LoopNet marketplace, so we want to grow our sales force to meet the scale of our future opportunity. As we add salespeople, they typically have material revenue impact about a year after they join us. We attribute a big part of our Apartments.com sales success to the priority we place on customer service. Our CoStar sales commission plans over the past year now reflect these same values. As a result, our salespeople are spending more face-to-face time with our clients and prospects. CoStar's sales meetings were up 43% year-over-year from 30,000 in the first quarter of 2018 to 43,000 in the most recent quarter. On a per salesperson basis, meetings were up 33%. Net Promoter Recommendation Scores for the CoStar sales force have climbed to 9.02 on a 10-point scale. I believe this is a leading indicator of client retention and future sales growth. Apartments.com continues to increase our industry-leading position among Internet listing services by achieving all-time highs and unique visitors and number of visits as reported by comScore for both the month of March and the first quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, the Apartments.com network had 162 million visits, up 35% year-over-year and averaged 20 million unique monthly visitors, an increase of 30% year-over-year. According to comScore, the Apartments.com network hit an all-time high of 61 million visits in March. That's an increase of 18 million visits over March of 2018 and is up 40% year-over-year. We have been the number one most visited apartment network for the past 41 months. Also according to comScore, as a network, we have twice the number of monthly visits and monthly unique visitors that the RentPath network had in the first quarter of 2019. On a site basis, Apartments.com had four times the number of monthly visits than Apartment Guide had. Apartments.com tracks a list of 10000 apartment key words that we believe are important for marketing multifamily communities online. As of today, we hold the number one organic position in Google score results for 93% of those keywords when compared to other listing sites. Our primary competitor RentPath only holds 2% of them. We continued to pull further away from the competition and I believe that in 2019, we will see a strengthening continuation of that trend. We launched our 2019 Apartments.com marketing campaign which focuses on the reality that the apartments you choose will change the future you. We have four new TV spots with the highest production quality and special effects we've ever produced. Of course they feature Jeff Goldblum as our spokesperson Brad Bellflower. We've already gotten great feedback from our clients from renters and the media on the campaign and we're excited that the heaviest portion of our media plan kicks in during the second quarter to support peak rental season. We're also excited to announce that tomorrow; we plan to launch a completely redesigned ForRent.com website just in time for peak rental season. The new site has a completely redefined renter search experience. Key features include a beautiful new design, lightning-fast performance and optimization to rank in the top of Google searches. It is the first site in our network of 11 sites that offers renters more of a focus on the independent or smaller properties by returning them mixed in to the very top of our search results to give renters the feeling that this is really a condo small home, small independent owner website as well as having large institutional properties. We plan to support the new site launch with aggressive levels of marketing support including paid search, display advertising, social media, e-mail marketing and strong push by our direct sales team. We look forward to the new site delivering even more traffic leads and leases to our advertisers. We've identified the need that some advertisers with properties in lease up low occupancy and highly competitive market environments have to drive additional lessor communities even beyond our existing top-level -- prior top-level diamond package. In response, we have introduced a newer higher-tiered advertising level called diamond plus, we're really creative with that name, which guarantees the advertiser placement in the top three search results in a given submarket. The diamond plus ads averaged approximately $4,050 per month or nearly $2,500 more per month than the old basic diamond ad. We believe diamond plus ads will continue to positively impact our net new bookings throughout 2019 and beyond. In March, LoopNet visits grew 23% year-over-year and we had nearly 6 million unique monthly visitors coming to the site. We are steadily rolling out a number of enhancements for LoopNet, as we continue to focus on improving the user experience. This is similar to the strategy we successfully deployed with Apartments.com marketplace. We continue to show strong success with sales of higher-priced Power Ads to owners on the LoopNet platform and these remain a major part of our growth strategy. We had nearly 3 million in annualized net new sales of Power Ads in the first quarter and the highest priced diamond level ad sales showed the strongest growth at 87% compared to the first quarter of last year. In the Premium Lister product, we continue to focus on raising the quality of the listings, eliminating unlimited listing plans, which were steeply discounted, and increasing prices on many of the older underpriced listing plans. Average price per listing for this product was up 49% compared to the same quarter last year. Realla is our United Kingdom emerging version of LoopNet. I'm very excited about the potential of that product and in fact we have seen a 346% year-over-year growth in unique visitors on Realla. Belbex is our version of LoopNet for Spain and its organic unique visitors are up 163% year-over-year. Right now, we're in investing phase on these sites, building out the traffic, but we intend to begin monetizing them later next year. We continue to deliver a steady stream of enhancements to the CoStar products. Dozens of these enhancements are new commercial real estate analytic tools. These include tools for accessing the probability of selling, leasing in various time frames, animated weather map-like time-based market trends laid over digital markets maps, market overview videos from our team of analysts and economists, daily rental rate detail, new statistical exports, retail property underwriting reports and much more soon to be followed by even more enhancements. We recently announced a strategic relationship with Fort Worth-based Buxton. Buxton is an industry leader in retail site analytics. They analyze and model a retailer's successful stores' competitive threats and store-to-store cannibalization among other factors and then determine ideal potential new locations that are likely to achieve above average sales. Now Buxton clients, who are also CoStar clients, will be able search CoStar for properties that are within ideal trade zones Buxton has identified. This combines the best strengths of each company to provide greater convenience and value to our mutual customers. Both firms intend to cross-sell to one another's client bases. In the first quarter of 2019 CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue was up 95% year-over-year. It continued its strong performance with an increase of 15% on net new bookings in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same strong quarter last year. Real Estate Manager continues to add Fortune 1000 customers such as HP, Archer Daniels, Campbell's Soup, AECOM, AraMark and many others. CoStar Real Estate Manager has staked out a leadership position in the lease accounting software market and Q1 represent the first quarter of reporting under the new ASC 842 standard. Continued opportunity exists with later-reporting public companies, as well as the full slate of large private companies. We expect to continue to leverage this market leadership position throughout the remainder of 2019. As we continue to add more institutional and analytic services to CoStar Suite, we've begun to enhance our research coverage of REITs, CMBSs and institutional investors. In the first quarter, we completed audit reconciliation upward of 12,000 REIT-owned properties, which encompassed 1.6 billion square feet. We added nearly 4,000 true owners to current or formerly owned REIT properties. We reconciled CMBS filings back to 2015 and stayed current on 2019 filings, adding thousands of new lease comps, rental points and new deals. Brokers using Listing Manager continued to be solid contributors to the database. In the U.S., more than 40% of our listings are added each month by our users and new users are steadily joining the ranks of Listing Manager. We plan to market Listing Manager to encourage more use of this service. We believe that the Listing Manager function in CoStar and LoopNet will help us to deliver higher quality data, more effective marketing benefits, greater convenience to our clients, all at a much lower cost than some of our historical data collection methods. Commercial real estate continues to attract unprecedented levels of interest from investors. Total deal volume has set new records in each of the past few years and pricing continues to rise. The high level of interest in commercial real estate is justified by sound fundamentals, characterized by strong leasing, consistent demand, limited supply and the lowest vacancy rates since 2000. The robust health of the sector has benefited the industry at large including brokers, appraisers, underwriters, owners and lenders. And in the multifamily sector, high levels of construction have been boosting advertising revenues for platforms like Apartments.com which is a near necessity for communities in lease up.  Barring any surprises, the U.S. will set a record -- the U.S. economy will set a record in July 2019 for the longest post-war expansion on record, with 102 months of consecutive job gains. We see no obvious imbalance threatening this remarkable streak in the commercial real estate markets and consensus forecast and CoStar's house view as growth continuing into 2020, albeit at a slower pace. International concerns around Brexit and China may deem to grow slightly, but may also perpetuate the flood of international capital that has fueled U.S. asset price gains, including in commercial and multifamily real estate. The slow and steady growth of the past few years has produced consistent demand in rent gains across all property types. Apartment rent growth accelerated last year, posting 3% gains for the first time since 2016, despite increasing supply, but a broad shortage of housing, especially the for-sale product has produced unprecedented demand for new rental product. And transaction volume continues to set new records, as investors clearly believe in the multifamily story. The office market features enviable fundamentals and limited supply at least outside of major markets, which are undergoing wholesale reinventions, like Hudson Yards in New York, the Boston Seaport, Amazon's HQ2 in Crystal City likely Union in Seattle, and South of Market in San Francisco, but single digit office vacancies have delivered only mediocre rent growth at just 2% over the past year. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the office market is the consistency of rent growth. Eight years of slow steady increases, a welcome departure from the boom/bust cycles of 1999 and 2007 or throw in there 1986 or 1981. I think that's roughly right. The outlook calls for more steady if modest rent gains, thanks to low vacancy levels, even if demand weakens. Demand for industrial properties remain at historically high levels, driven by the growth -- growing trend towards online purchasing and same-day delivery. Still, vacancy rates appear to have bottomed out, amid record-setting deliveries. Persistent rent growth of more than 5% has drawn record-setting sales volume, resulting in price appreciation exceeding 10% year-over-year. The growing economy has yet to reverse lackluster dynamics for the retail sector though, as structural change in the industry weigh on demand for physical space. While well-located properties continue to perform well, historically low vacancy rates are still mainly a result of limited construction and have yet to fuel significant rent gains. We expect the record levels of interest in commercial and multifamily real estate to continue across all property types, and in any economic outcome CoStar Group offers products and services that are essential to owners, lenders, brokers, investors and property managers alike, as they participate in commercial real estate's increasingly competitive ultra high stakes marketplace. It's been a great start to the New Year for CoStar and I'm extremely excited about the rest of the year and particularly the coming decade, as we continue to execute on our long-term vision. At this point, I'm going to liven up the call by turning it over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Well, I thank you Andy. A flattering introduction. Here comes the lively portion of the call. I'm going to call it call plus. Okay. All right. Well, we did have a great start to 2019, great sales numbers, produced great revenue growth and these both allow our leverage model to give us increased levels of profitability and strong cash generation. So, as Andy mentioned, revenue in the first quarter of 2019 increased 20% over first quarter of 2018, which was near the high end of our guidance. Looking at revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was 13% in the first quarter of 2019 versus first quarter of 2018. The growth is primarily driven to both brokers and owners, and it's evenly balanced between existing clients and new logos. As previously communicated, the revenue growth rate for CoStar Suite is expected to be in the 11% to 13% range for 2019. Revenue in the Information Services group grew 25% year-over-year in the first quarter, primarily as a result of CoStar Real Estate Manager's revenue growth of 95%. The adoption of the new lease accounting standards created strong demand for our Real Estate Manager product, which we do expect to continue although, slightly moderated throughout the year as we move past the peak adoption date of the new lease standard. Information Services revenue is expected to grow at a rate of 11% to 13% on a year-over-year basis.  Multifamily revenue growth for Q1 remained strong at 30% over the first quarter of 2018 just in line with our expectations. Going forward, the second and third quarters of 2019 are expected to reflect lower growth rates than the first quarter of 2019 for two reasons both related to the ForRent acquisition. First, we've now lapped the anniversary date of the ForRent acquisition. Second, there will be a modest negative effect on the 2019 growth rate because certain products and duplicative revenues were eliminated since the acquisition forwarding our 2018 base results. The growth rate in the second quarter for 2019 is expected to be in the low-teens increasing to the high-teens by the third quarter. On a pro forma basis, when you include ForRent for all of 2018 and you exclude the discontinued services the year-over-year multifamily revenue growth will be approximately 20% in both the second and the third quarters of 2019. Multifamily revenue is expected to exit 2019 in line with the 20% full year outlook for multifamily. Last but certainly not least commercial property and land revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2019. This is due to continued strong sales of LoopNet marketing products including our tiered advertising products which grew approximately 37% year-over-year in the first quarter. Our lands business also contributed to strong growth with 21% year-over-year revenue growth and we continue to expect organic growth in the commercial property and land sector in the 18% to 20% range for 2019. Gross margins came in at 78% in the first quarter of 2019 in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018 and we expect this level of gross margin to continue around 78% for 2019. Operating expenses of $164 million for the first quarter of 2019 were slightly below our expectations primarily as a result of modest timing delays in our marketing and some G&A spend. First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $125 million represents a 49% increase compared to adjusted EBITDA of $84 million in the first quarter of 2018. The adjusted EBITDA was approximately $3 million above the midpoint of our guidance range and about $1 million above the high end our guidance range. Resulting adjusted EBITDA margin of 38% is 90 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance and 740 basis points above the 31% margin we achieved in the first quarter of 2018. Net income for the first quarter of 2019 of $85 million increased 63% or $33 million compared to first quarter of 2018. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 13% reflecting benefits associated with share-based payment transactions. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter increased 54% to $92 million or $2.53 per diluted share and includes adjustments for stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter assumes a tax rate of 25% which does not include discrete items such as the impact of the share-based payment transaction. Cash and investment balances were approximately $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2019 up $132 million since the end of 2018. Now let's look at some of our performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, our sales force totaled approximately 757 people. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the first quarter was in line with the rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 90%. Our renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 96% in line with the 96% renewal rate in the fourth quarter of 2018. Subscription revenue on annual contracts now accounts for 82% of our revenue in the first quarter up from 79% this time last year. The improvements are primarily the result of our successful migration of the ForRent customer base our Apartments.com network and to annual contracts. I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the second quarter of 2019. Based on first quarter revenue and sales results, our full year 2019 revenue range of $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue growth for the year between 15% and 16%. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2019 in the range of $333 million to $337 million representing top line growth of around 13% at the midpoint. The growth rate expected in the second quarter is negatively impacted by the discontinued ForRent revenues mentioned earlier and the lapping of the anniversary of that acquisition. On a pro forma basis including ForRent for all of 2018 and excluding discontinued services, our revenue growth rate outlook for the second quarter would be approximately 16%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $495 million to $505 million for the full year of 2019 in line with our previous outlook. Year-over-year we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% with adjusted EBITDA margin for the year of approximately 36% at the midpoint of the guided range. For the second quarter of 2019, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $98 million to $102 million. As in prior years, we expect the second quarter to be the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year as we increase our marketing spend for the start of the peak apartment rental season. Margins are expected to increase sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. In terms of earnings our revised range of $9.90 to $10.10 for full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share is an increase of approximately $0.10 at the midpoint compared to our previous outlook. In the second quarter of 2019, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $1.94 to $2.02 based on 36.7 million shares. So to wrap things up a great start to the year. We're in a very strong position financially. And I certainly look forward to updating each and everyone of you on our progress as we continue throughout the year.
Andy Florance: That's definitely call plus.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you. Let's open it up for some questions.
Operator: All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Your 2Q guidance implies about 120 basis points of year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion at the midpoint, which compares with 740 bps of margin expansion you just delivered and your full year guidance suggest the rate of margin expansion will narrow relative to the first half. Can you discuss the factors that are driving a more conservative back-end margin outlook?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. I think what you see George is certainly the timing of investment costs. Second quarter is primarily driven by all the marketing that we're spending and we expect that to be our strongest quarter, but still up when comparing to the fourth quarter over the prior years. I think you also see a lot of benefit in the first quarter as we passed the ForRent acquisition annualizing and so all those benefits are now into the numbers as we lap the margin improvements we got last year from ForRent. So those are pretty much the biggest factors I would call out.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And now to the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon everyone.
Andy Florance: Welcome, Bill.
Scott Wheeler: Welcome, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So is it true that you're handing out free Teslas to all the sell-side analysts? Is that what I heard something about that?
Andy Florance: It depends on the nature of the report.
Scott Wheeler: That was a good question Bill. Thanks.
Bill Warmington: All right. Now the real question. The -- so I was...
Andy Florance: These are for top performers.
Bill Warmington: The -- I was hoping for an update on the LoopNet marketplace in two ways: One being the build-out of the LoopNet marketplace site and how that's going and second is maybe to talk about some changes in the sales force structure moving to a more of a national account coverage model that might help the sale of that product.
Andy Florance: Sure. So definitely a lot of effort, a lot of work going on, on LoopNet 2.0. And actually it was -- I was about there for a week or so last year -- the development the last week. Two weeks ago, I was with the development team for the week out in California going over the product, a very productive meeting. And we hope to make strong releases in the third and fourth quarter around that product area. I picked up a customer service call this morning randomly and the customer was complaining they wanted two major features in LoopNet that we have already put into the new design, so in the right top of the list, so stronger and easier searching for restaurants and being able to highlight things with broker comments. So I'm feeling good about that where that's going. We're also -- I spent last week with our photography team making sure they have the right to support the new elements of that product. And you can see the growth begin to click up and we remain very excited about it. You also see it beginning up an effort going on in Spain and in United Kingdom to match the effort that we're doing here. And so all in all, it remains on track and we're excited about it. In terms of the major accounts or the national accounts, the sales force, we took the -- we had last year quotas on what the sales force needed to sell of LoopNet in order to make the higher commission rates. We removed that this year, so they could focus on general customer service and set their own allocations and priorities. And the nice thing is the sales results have continued to come in for LoopNet naturally without the commission focuses. So we think that's been good. And we will be structuring the LoopNet major national accounts the same way we structure Apartments.com in the near future. So it's a lot of software work going on and a lot of operating work that needs to be done to position for it, but it's on track and it's a top priority.
Operator: All right. Thank you. And now to the line of David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Ridley-Lane: Sure. Two questions on the impact of the ForRent product cancellation. One, do you have some sort of quantification for the impact on net bookings in the first quarter? And two, did I get my sort of the math right around your guidance for the second quarter that it's about $3 million of revenue that was canceled through the second quarter? Is that in the ballpark? Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: No. We don't have a number on the bookings side David. There was -- there's certainly effects running through last year, but we didn't talk about that on the booking side effect. But on the pro forma side, let's see the -- let me look for the Apartments pro forma for you. Just a second, I will get it. I know it's here somewhere. So, yeah, we had somewhere between $3 million and $6 million per quarter throughout the year that are going to effect us and the biggest effect would have been in the second quarter for 2018. So hopefully that help give you some idea of how big those discontinued revenues are.
Operator: All right. Thank you, and now to the line of Peter Christiansen from Citi. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. On the 40% bookings growth in multifamily, do you have any sense of what portion of that is coming from competitive takeaways versus just normal wins, new wins? And then my follow-up is with $1.2 billion going on $1.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet, what's your sense for deploying that capital as we look forward the next couple of quarters?
Andy Florance: Good questions. So on the first one, I was -- I ran into our Head of Apartment Sales last week, Deb Richmond, and she couldn't wait to tell me about some huge competitive wins we just had. I think she was talking about some community with 135 properties moving over something or some organization 135 properties moving here. So my sense is that there is a lot of competitive shift going on. We are having some success with the Diamond Plus ads as well, but a lot of it is competitive shift, and the numbers are really quite impressive. Like when I look at the total accounts, I won't recall exactly what the number was the last time I looked, but they are very impressive competitive wins. And for good reason, because the traffic numbers are so compelling, the lead advantages are so compelling in Apartments.com, and the benefit of having invested well over $1 billion in Apartments.com has resulted in a huge competitive distancing going on there. I also got an e-mail today from the Apartments regional sales manager with someone moving a bunch of properties over, and they specifically cited the quality of our customer service. They said the fact that we were in their communities every month or every 1.5 months, briefing them on what was happening in their local market, and the fact that they had not seen the competitor in four years was a major factor in shifting all their purchasing over to us. So on hard numbers, I've seen the last two months, I would say a major competitive shift. And anecdotally in the last two weeks I'd say, a continuation and possible acceleration in competitive shift. In terms of our petty cash of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, we remain active in looking at a number of potential acquisitions, but we remain selective. And we devote a significant amount of effort to that ongoing. And those things will happen in time, but our track record over the last 20 years of acquiring 30-plus companies, it's sort of hard to imagine that won't continue. And so that -- we would expect that capital would be put to good use in transformative ways, and we look forward to that day.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey, guys.
Andy Florance: Hi, Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: Thank you for the update today. Andy, one of the areas that has come up over the years is international. And you just kind of mentioned big markets, but maybe not a whole lot of companies with critical mass or maybe different market structures. It sounds like maybe you're getting closer to monetizing that opportunity now. Can you kind of frame that up, and what might it mean over the next few years for your growth?
Andy Florance: Sure. So we're -- I mean you're right. There are some acquisition opportunities over there that are midsized that could be interesting, but that -- really what we're focusing on is just organic growth in those markets. So we have been ratcheting up our investment in the last 18 months in the United Kingdom. We're in Germany and Spain. We see some exciting -- some good opportunities in France, availability of lower cost digital data, machine learning to harvest data on the Internet. So we're in an investing period. And we saw -- on a small scale, we saw a huge growth in the first quarter in the United Kingdom in our bookings, but still modest by comparison to the United States. And we think that we had our expectation that that growth will payoff in the next couple of years. The nice thing is now we're getting a multi-country footprint and we'll be -- I think it’ll be transformative when we can put three or four European countries into one consistent platform. So that's one of our big goals in the next three years or so, and I think that will move us up to parallel growth rates with the United States.
Operator: Thank you. And now to the line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi, guys good evening. On bookings, it seems like you're continuing to see broad-based momentum, but I wanted to ask how bookings activity in the first quarter compared to your expectation. So just excluding the LoopNet runoff in the year-ago, $48 million this quarter was down some relative to the $54 million in the year ago period and $50 million in the fourth quarter. I know there's some seasonality relative to the fourth quarter, but anything else that we should consider when making the sequential and the year-over-year bookings comparisons?
Andy Florance: Not really. I think I was -- we were very happy with the bookings. I was upwardly surprised as the Apartments.com bookings were extremely strong and continue to be extremely strong. We are running the business looking nine months a year or so out. So we're working a lot of things that are not month-to-month. And there is always volatility as you look at the numbers like what land might be doing one quarter, what farms might be doing one quarter. Things shift around they're all generally really strong, but there is -- since they're real returns and real sales results, there's volatility to them. If they were ever perfectly linear that would be a made-up situation that's not happening. And so they move around but they're strong. I think we got the payoff from last year's customer service and conversion efforts with ForRent when you see the surge in productivity there. The investment in additional face time with customers with CoStar will probably pay off in the next two quarters. So, all-in-all, great quarter, very happy with the results and phenomenal results.
Operator: Thank you. And now to line of Mayank Tandon from Needham. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Andy or Scott, is there a way to think about revenue growth in terms of the pricing uplift you expect this year and over time and the contribution from new clients plus increased penetration from current clients? How should we think about the growth profile if you break it down that way? I do realize it's going to be difficult across different segments, but just maybe for the company overall.
Andy Florance: I'll turn some rocks and you can do as well. So a lot of the pricing lift we're seeing is we are not driving aggressive price increases against our core customers for the same price -- same products with the exception being on our marketplaces demand is really strong. So at LoopNet, you're seeing super strong demand in markets like Southern California and Southern Florida, so you get some saturation on advertisers. So we're eliminating big, big steeply discounted contracts. So if someone was getting 60% price breaks or discounts, we're eliminating those consistently and bringing people more up to a standard pricing level that looks -- that gives you that 49% year-over-year price lift on PL. It's not so much we're taking all -- everybody up. We're eliminating low-end discounts. Then you're getting product transformation. So as we rebuild LoopNet to really effectively showcase mega properties, super high-end properties those will be sold at dramatically higher price points, but to new customers for new product. So, that will bring the ASP up dramatically but not because we're doing across the board increases for the same product. They will be more incremental prices. The -- this continues as we go into more analytic products for CoStar. You're selling to higher utility institutional clients. You get higher ASPs there as well. But delivering product to the one or two person brokerage shop in Oklahoma City remains just as high a priority. We're not taking those prices up beyond roughly inflation. So it's a mix. Do you want to…?
Scott Wheeler: Yeah. We track the price/volume mix equation into the big groups. And as you just said the only place we really had price increase was in the LoopNet, getting rid of some of those discounts. And then as we moved people in the ForRent acquisition to the broader network then you saw this other effect of moving to a broader network contract, which would have higher revenues per property than what we had before. So it's not really a price increase. It's a broader package increasing. So it's those types of things and the other one that Andy mentioned that are really driving what we call price, which really is accounting for a good half of what our revenue growth is in many quarters because of those effects.
Operator: All right. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And now to the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Joe Goodwin: This is actually Joe Goodwin on for Pat. Thank you for taking my question. Just curious, if you talk about the salesperson…
Andy Florance: Securities?
Joe Goodwin: Yeah, JMP Securities a little mistake there. Yeah, as a former software salesperson myself as I was looking at the Net Promoter Score that you guys shared earlier and they seemed really high. And from my experience people don't always love speaking with software sales reps. I guess that would imply. So I guess just really curious how do you guys go about calculating those scores? And how and when do you collect that data?
Andy Florance: Yeah. So what happens is there is a independent team that works in a different group from sales based out of Atlanta, Georgia. And each day they look at meetings that occurred four to 24 hours prior. And they randomly sample the people that those meetings were held with. And I won't get the wording exactly right. But they say based on your meeting yesterday and your overall impression of Apartments or CoStar, how likely will you recommend CoStar or Apartments.com to a friend or colleague. So it's the recommended question. And that gets us a 9.02 on CoStar, and gets us to 9.8 on Apartments.com. And there was one woman sorry I can't remember her name or where she was, who for the year last year star scored 9.98. So she is just a little bit of a stronger salesperson than you were. But the -- I'd have to hand it to her like if you get a 9.98 -- and I'll try to get her name for the next earnings call. But I won't actually because I might sound as a recruiter. You're right, that people don't want to talk to -- typically don't want to spend their day with software salespeople but we try to make sure that we're showing them some new benefit to them. We also talk to them about the general market. I also believe we delivered over one million tchotchkes last year.
A – Scott Wheeler: …the cookies and the candies.
Andy Florance: The cookies, candy, a charger cable, a cozy. We delivered so many little minor gifts. We do have all kinds of strategies for building those relationships. And that tends to work.
Operator: Thank you. And now, to the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan, Please go ahead.
Q – Sterling Auty: [Indiscernible]
A – Andy Florance: Sterling we're having a hard time hearing you.
Q – Sterling Auty: Is that any better?
A – Andy Florance: Better.
A – Scott Wheeler: That's Better.
Q – Sterling Auty: Okay. I was saying that, in your prepared remarks you had the commentary obviously in the strength of the multifamily, but also the deceleration in commercial real estate. Just from a high level does that mean that you -- as you look throughout the rest of the year that the focus of the investments will continue to be on the strength in multifamily housing? And just to this quarter did you invest in the level you thought you would in the commercial real estate part of the business?
A – Andy Florance: I would think that we did invest in the commercial real estate side the way, we'd expect to. And investing -- I think the question is reinvesting into the strength of multifamily. In the prepared remarks, I've noticed that and I thought, yes, there's a lot of upside in commercial real estate right now as for the whole economy. And yes, the statistics, the market indicators are all as the best I've seen in my career, for sure. I hate that I'd admit this. But I also -- we noted earlier $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in cash. Downturns are good too because we bought some amazing companies in the downturn. And we are not terribly cyclical as a company. We typically are able to grow through downturns. And there is actually both a cyclical advantage to strengthen the apartment industry for us. As people are building a lot of new developments, they are ready to invest in getting faster lease up on those new buildings. Conversely when the wheels come off and vacancy rates drop what they spend on, lead generation with Apartments.com is peanuts or any other call for term you want to use compared to the amount of money at risk in these communities. So when someone's spending $1,100, $1,200 a month on getting the majority of their leads to keep their $250 million property leased and solvent they don't cut back on that $1,100 a month. So, I think that's one of the nice things about our business is we are pretty -- we benefit in the up cycle and we're very resilient on the down cycle, but still today no indicators showing a down cycle.
Operator: Thank you. We have no one else in queue. Please continue.
Andy Florance: Well, with that, we're going to wrap up the call. Thanks everyone for joining us. And thank you Scott for a fantastic call plus. And thank you Rich for a really fascinating read on the risks and the definitions. And I look forward to hearing you -- hearing -- spending time with you guys again at the end of the second quarter.

Andy Florance: Rich, that was authentic and moving. Thank you.
Rich Simonelli: You are welcome.
Andy Florance: Thank you all for joining us for CoStar Group's fourth quarter 2018 and year-end earnings call. First number I want to focus on is our adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, which was 44%. By achieving that strong margin, we have successfully accomplished an important financial goal. Five years ago in 2014, we set two key long-range financial goals for 2018, one was to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue; and the second was to reach 40% adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2018. Today, five years later, with $1.2 billion in revenue for the full year 2018 and a 44% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, our team is pleased to have solidly delivered on both of those goals. Delivering this sort of consistent growth is on target with our long-range record of good growth. Since 2011, we've achieved a 25% compound annual revenue growth rate, which is in line with our 20-year compound annual growth rate of 25%. For the full-year 2018, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, over 600 basis points of improvement over 2017. EBITDA in 2018 was $351 million, an increase of 48% compared to $237 million for 2017. Net income was $238 million in 2018 compared to $123 million in 2017, a 94% increase. The past five years have proven that we can grow the top-line, expand margins and still make significant growth investments into the business. Some of those recent investments include the Richmond Research Center, expanding and marketing the Apartments.com network, growing our sales team, integrating the CoStar and LoopNet databases, and expanding our Canadian and European businesses. Our most significant growing investments are products and software development. Those investments have allowed us to build powerful, profitable businesses with strong leadership positions with CoStar Suite, the Apartments network, CoStar Real Estate Manager, LoopNet and many others. Because of our exceptional technology, deep understanding of real estate and the value of our connected commercial real estate communities, we have created transformative value for our clients. We are now attracting 42 million people to our websites monthly and have earned the business with 150,000 CoStar subscribers. This has enabled us to balance investing back into our business while still significantly expanding our margins. CoStar Group holds a leadership position in the exciting transformation of a multi-trillion-dollar real estate industry moving from offline to online. We have positioned the Company well for the enormous long-term opportunity that lies ahead of us by building an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We have $1.1 billion in cash, no debt, and $351 million of growing EBITDA to leverage. CoStar Group has acquired dozens of companies and expects to continue acquiring companies that will bring value to our shareholders. CoStar Suite revenue grew 18% in 2018 over 2017. Commercial property and land, which includes LoopNet.com as well as our land and business sites, grew 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full-year of 2018, multifamily revenue grew 45% versus 2017, as our multifamily revenue increased to $406 million. CoStar Real Estate Manager grew an astounding 124% year-over-year and is already off to a strong start this year. That's right, 124%. We now have more than $1 billion of visible, high-margin, reoccurring or subscription revenue. Company-wide net new bookings of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 were the best we've ever achieved. That’s an increase of 15% year-over-year and 26% over the third quarter of 2018. Remember that the fourth quarter 2017 was an exceptional quarter for us as one of our long-term competitors filed bankruptcy. For the full year of 2018, we turned in another top performance with $169 million in net new bookings. In a sense, even that number is understand because it does not include all the work our sales team did in signing tens of millions of dollars of ForRent revenue into Apartments.com contracts. In the fourth quarter 2018, we signed two large brokerage firms to new, multiyear contracts. The contract we signed with CBRE was our first global contract. CBRE has been a great longtime customer of CoStar and their users are spending more time in our products than ever before. 2018 CBRE users doubled their time spent working in CoStar over 2016. This is a testament to the growing utility of our products to top industry players. Marcus & Millichap also signed a multiyear contract renewal with us, and they pointed directly to improvements made in research, particularly our tenant data as a reason for going forward with us and expanding the volume of services they buy from us. They're also renewing and growing Canadian contracts with us. In 2018, our CoStar field sales force began focusing on selling LoopNet in addition to CoStar. We did this because it makes good sense and we feel that our customers prefer one point of contact. As a result, net new year-over-year bookings for LoopNet.com increased by 74%. With two products to sell, the sales force is selling a bit less CoStar but sign much more of the combined services. Clearly, this is a good tradeoff. Our Apartments.com sales force is doing a great job. The fourth quarter of 2018 was our best sales quarter ever for Apartments.com. Our sales force has essentially completed, converting ForRent customers to Apartments.com customers, so they now have more time available to focus on signing new business. Hitting a record Apartments.com sales quarter in the fourth quarter is a remarkable achievement, given the fact that historically apartment internet listing services suffered from sharp seasonality and historically would contract in the fourth quarter. So, setting records in the fourth quarter is great. Our Apartments.com sales force knows the power of client service and how it leads to more sales. 2018, they conducted 309,000 client meetings and most of our reps averaged nearly seven meetings per day; some are averaging almost 10 client meetings a day. An independent group within CoStar follows up many of these meetings by calling and asking the client a scale of 1 to 10, how likely they are to recommend Apartments.com to a friend. On average, our clients give us a 9.64. One of our best reps, Nicole Gagliardi across 1,000 meetings, scored an outstanding 9.94 and A++. I believe the sales team is the best in the industry, and I'm looking forward to another excellent year with them. In 2018, according to comScore, the Apartments.com network had 0.5 billion visits for the full year, up 33% over 2017. In one month, according to Google Analytics, we saw 57 million visits across the Apartments.com network. We averaged 17 point million unique visitors per month over the course of the year, according to comScore, which is an increase of 35% compared to 2017. This is by far the most in the industry as we continue to pull away from RentPath, which only had 208 million visits in 2018 and averaged less than $8.8 million unique visitors per month. Even more impressively, for the full year of 2018, Apartments.com leads were up 43%. With almost 300 million more visits in RentPath and great lead flow, we believe the obvious choice for an advertiser has to be Apartments.com. In 2018, 4,600 properties advertising with RentPath started advertising with Apartments.com. We estimate that there are only 6,000 to 8,000 that still advertise on RentPath and do not yet advertise on Apartments.com, and we are focused on capturing that business. In 2018, RentPath got a competitive rest or little competitive holiday where we focused on the ForRent conversion, but in 2019, we’ll dramatically increase the competitive intensity. We believe that RentPath may have a ticking time bomb of a pricing problem. We believe that similar apartment properties in the same city are paying wildly different prices for essentially the same advertising levels. This may have happened because they used to have much better share of traffic and RentPath may be relying on long term clients to keep paying yesterday's higher prices that might have been justified years ago when the traffic was good. But now these prices may not make any sense. How will long-term clients react if they find out that new clients are paying a fraction of the price for the same product. It used to make sense to pay $3 a minute to use a 10-pound mobile bag phone and you were cool. Today, a cellular provider would not be able to sustain that $3 a minute pricing for long in a highly competitive market. We now have over 50,000 properties advertised on our network, up from 18,000 when we purchased Apartments.com in 2014. In just 10 months, we have successfully integrated ForRent, the largest acquisition we've ever made. We're increasing our 2019 Apartments marketing budget by 11% year-over-year, in an effort to gain more share. We expect to launch our new, bigger 2019 marketing campaign shortly. The campaign will once again feature, Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower. The 2019 campaign is called enter the apartmenternet. There will be a lot of futuristic technology and special effects that will make the ads fun and memorable. We hired director, Taika Waititi famous for directing the recent blockbuster smash hit, Thor, Ragnar to direct our spots, so that the production value and quality will be truly first class. We just wrapped up filming these new TV spots. In the series, we emphasize the vast array of alternative futures the renter can potentially have by choosing various apartments alternatives. The aggressive plan calls for over 8,000 television ads, 6 billion digital impressions, 300 million streaming impressions to reach 95% of renters. We expect that the net impact of this investment will be well over 600 million renter visits in 2019 to the Apartments.com network. According to Company estimates, there are 14 million apartment units in larger apartment buildings with 100 units or more. That represents only 31% of the 45 million rental units in the United States. Despite the fact that it represents only 31% of the market, the overwhelming majority of Apartments.com’s revenues comes from this upper 31% of the market. 84% of the 540,000 apartment buildings in the U.S. are smaller and have 4 units to 100 units. In addition, there are 17 million other units altogether that are in condos, townhouses or properties with less than four units. These smaller properties are owned by what we call, independent owners or the IO market. The IO market does not have the scale and resources of larger players like Greystar, AvalonBay, Pinnacle and other large property managers, we believe that without the benefits of scale, independent owners spend more time and money leasing each unit. We further believe that there is far more absolute revenue potential in independent owner and small apartment building market than there is in the upper end or institutional market. We believe we've done a better job than any other online company at monetizing the upper end of the market. Now, in 2019, monetizing the other 69% of the United States rental housing market will become our top priority. We have been and expect to continue to invest very aggressively in building out the software platforms and products that we believe will enable us to provide compelling, online rental solutions that appeal to both renters and independent owners. We want to take many of the traditionally offline or disparate functions required to leasing apartment and move them into one seamless, online, easy to use solution. It's an exciting project to work on and we're motivated by the potential to have a very positive impact on tens of millions of renters and independent owners. Part of that effort includes our November purchase of Cozy Services. They’re leader in the online rental property market and have nearly 60,000 landlords using their services. There are approximately 150,000 renters making lease payments through Cozy, totaling $1.7 billion in 2018. We believe that Cozy provides a best-in-class solution for one of the key components of the rental process, so we're integrating Cozy into the Apartments.com full rental cycle. We will control the costs associated with selling solutions to a much larger audience at lower price points by relying on e-commerce sales to monetize the higher volume independent owner market rather than using our field sales force. It's our goal that this new solution will form the foundation of our 2020 marketing campaign. We plan to share more details about our new products as we get closer to launching them. 2019 will be the first full year that LoopNet's position as a pure online marketplace, like Apartments.com rather than a hybrid information solution and marketing platform. LoopNet has become a vital utility for tens of thousands of commercial real estate professionals seeking to market their properties to the millions of tenants and investors looking for commercial real estate online. LoopNet is the most heavily trafficked commercial real estate marketplace with approximately 5 million unique visitors in a month. LoopNet generates $127 million of annual revenue on a very high margin. While we’ve more than tripled LoopNet’s marketing revenues since CoStar acquired the Company in 2012, we believe that we can further innovate and evolve the LoopNet solution and more than triple the revenue again with a focused effort and site relaunch. Early in LoopNet’s evolution, it was best suited to marketing smaller properties, often for sale properties in suburban areas, or tertiary cities. The economics on these smaller properties are a fraction of the economics involved in a large office property leasing or industrial. While CoStar group has years of experience marketing tens of thousands of major properties for office properties for lease, LoopNet was not originally optimized for marketing and leasing, prestigious, brand conscious office buildings. In 2019, we're investing aggressively to redevelop and relaunch the next generation of LoopNet, so that it better meets the needs of a much broader cross-section of the commercial real estate industry. This effort is very similar to the effort we successfully made to relaunch and reposition the Apartments.com site after we acquired it from Classified Ventures in 2014. This is a comprehensive project, engaging much more than just our software development teams. Similar to the Apartments.com launch, we expect this will engage more than half our Company. We're very excited about the opportunity to exploit the potential of a next generation, online marketing platform for commercial real estate. 2018 ended with commercial vacancies near all-time lows, prices and rents at all-time highs and leasing and transaction volume setting new records for the year. The ongoing health of commercial real estate is the result of solid economic growth in 2018, which although slowing in the fourth quarter, accelerated for the year, as fiscal stimulus kicked in. Almost 2.7 million jobs were created last year and the unemployment rate is hovering at or below 4%. All of that is great for commercial real estate. The industrial market continues to lead all property types in terms of rent growth, price appreciation, take-up and new supply. The industrial sector’s outperformance results for the ongoing shift to online buying which has produced strong demand for infill and regional bulk distribution centers across all markets. Ecommerce has also affected the traditional retail sector. Retail rents have trailed the other property types, and developers have delivered little new space. However, well-located retail assets continue to show strong performance, and demand for quality space matched with very little new construction has kept overall retail vacancies at historic lows. In the office sector, vacancies fell into the single digits last year for the first time since the early 2000s, the result of healthy absorption and limited new supply. Rent growth at the national level stayed within a narrow band of around 2% over last eight quarters but has weekend in some coastal markets which are facing higher levels of supply. Many secondary markets on the other hand have enjoyed stronger rent growth as new construction still remains low. For the multifamily sector, absorption reached a cyclical high as a strong labor market and rising mortgage rates resulted in high demand for rental units. Apartment rent growth accelerated, exceeding 3% for the first time since 2015, and transaction volume and pricing continue to set new records. In summary, 2018 was another remarkable year in unprecedented streak for commercial real estate. We see no reason that the slow and steady status quo that has defined this cycle, won't continue for the foreseeable future. That said, the prospect of rising interest rates and narrowing spreads appear to have broaden into nearly a decade of cap rate compression, the cap rates remain very-low. Still, construction remains limited, leasing remains healthy across all property types and rising mortgage rates could safeguard apartment demand. We're proud to have delivered on the financial goals we set for CoStar back in 2014. We are now coming off our best year ever, and we're moving into 2019 and a strong commercial real estate market with great products, great clients, great people, great research and a phenomenal sales team. We believe that 2019 will be another great year for CoStar Group and our clients. We told you that upon completing our last five-year financial goal, we would set a new goal for 2023. That goal will be to exit 2023 at a $3 billion revenue run rate with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40% or more for the full year. While we anticipate acquisitions will contribute, we believe that most of our growth will be organic. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to the accomplished mountaineer and our CFO, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. It's a great introduction, feeling very accomplished today. Let me go raise my chair a little. I feel better up here. Great. Yes, 2018, what a great year we had for CoStar, very strong growth, we acquired three businesses, we invested for our future and we expanded our margin over 600 basis points. On top of that, I, for one, am happy, we can put these old tired long-term goals behind us and move on to multibillion land next. All right. Let me start with some insights on our revenue results, which in the full year of 2018 increased 23% over 2017 while our growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 24% versus the prior year. Looking at our revenue performance by services. CoStar Suite revenue growth was 18% for the full year 2018, as expected and 16% in the fourth quarter of 2018, coming in slightly above our 15% guidance range. CoStar Suite sales were very good in the fourth quarter as we continued strong conversion of our LoopNet users to CoStar and we completed the long-term contract renewals with all CBRE and Marcus & Millichap Andy mentioned. As we head into 2019, we expect the CoStar Suite growth rates to moderate sequentially as they did in the fourth quarter of 2018 and settle in, in the range of 11% to 13% for the year. There are a couple factors converging here to note. First, we fully lapped the very-high revenue growth quarters that followed the LoopNet integration and the Xceligent bankruptcy. Second, we have a sale substitution effect here as our CoStar sales force is focused on selling more LoopNet to accelerate the growth of that marketplace. In total, the team is delivering more-combined sales, in fact 20% more in 2018 than in 2017. So, we like this increased productivity. We will see some shifting effect between CoStar to LoopNet. Revenue growth and Information Services was 11% in the fourth quarter of 2018, so our first quarter of positive growth in over two years when we stopped actively selling the LoopNet information product. In fact, that LoopNet information was over 50% of the revenue was over 50% of the revenue in Information Services. All that revenue has effectively gone and CoStar Real Estate Manager and CoStar Risk Analytics have made up the gap. CoStar Real Estate Manager revenue continued its outstanding growth, increasing 165% in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect total revenue from Information Services to increase at a rate of 11% to 13% on a year-over-year basis throughout 2019. It's great to finally put behind this that negative growth rate. We had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter in multifamily as revenue increased 45% year-over-year, including the impact for the ForRent acquisition. For the full year 2018, average number of properties that advertised on our network increased approximately 25% while the average revenue per property improved 20%. Looking forward, we expect multifamily revenue growth of approximately 20% for the full year of 2019. We expect growth of approximately 30% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 as we lap the late February acquisition date of ForRent. Growth rates in the second and third quarters should be in the mid-teens due to the negative effect of certain duplicative and discontinued revenues from ForRent that was in our 2018 results that won't be in our 2019 results. The growth rate exiting 2019 is expected to be in line with the 20% full year outlook for multifamily. Finally, in commercial property and land, revenue grew 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2018. This strong growth reflects the increased sales of LoopNet marketing products by our national CoStar field sales force. Our LoopNet tiered advertising products performed exceptionally well, growing approximately 50% for the year. For 2019, we expect revenue growth in commercial property and land in the 18% to 20% range. Our gross margin was 77% for the full year 2018 and it came in at 78% in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 200 basis points from the third quarter of 2018 and 130 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. We're certainly realizing the benefits of strong operating leverage in our research operations, which we expect to continue as our listing manager tools achieve greater adoption throughout 2019. We expect overall gross margins of 78% for 2019 with margins improving throughout the year to between 79% to 80% by the end of 2019. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $139 million was approximately $12 million above the midpoint of our guidance range, due to revenue outperformance of approximately $6 million and lower expenses primarily personnel related. I know we said it already but it really never gets old. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter came in at 44%, above our 41% margin guidance and long-term goal of 40%. Net income for the full year of 2018 was $238 million, 94% ahead of the prior year, reflecting tremendous operating profit growth as well as the R&D tax credits we achieved in the second quarter of 2018. Net income was $9 million ahead of the net income expected in our guidance forecast for the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the full year of 2018 was $302 million and includes adjustments for stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. This represents growth of 96% compared to 2017. Now, let’s take a look at some performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the year, our sales force totaled 741 people, a slight increase from the 733 sales people we reported at the end of the third quarter of 2018. We anticipate a modest increase in the size of our sales force in 2019, primarily focused on CoStar and LoopNet. The renewal rate on annual contracts for the fourth was broadly in line with the rate achieved in the third quarter of 2018 at 90%, which was down slightly from the 91% we achieved in fourth quarter of 2017. Renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 96%, consistent with the third quarter of 2018 and down slightly from the 97% in the first quarter of 2017. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 80.9% of our revenue in the quarter, up from 79.7% this time last year. We're now one full year past the date we acquired ForRent when we completed the integration. When we announced the deal, we expected to add revenue of approximately $75 million to $85 million with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to be in a range of 45% to 55%. I'm happy to say we achieved our financial objectives after only 10 months. These results are highly accretive as you can tell by our profit results and indicate a post synergy acquisition price of less than 9 times EBITDA, certainly not a bad day’s work. So, now, I'll discuss our outlook for the full year and the first quarter of 2019. We expect revenue in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.38 billion for the full year of 2019. This implies an annual growth rate of 15% to 16% over 2018. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2019 in the range of $325 million to $329 million. This represents approximately 19% to 20% growth compared to the first quarter of last year. As I noted earlier, we booked approximately one month of ForRent revenue in the first quarter of 2018, which is why our consolidated growth for the first quarter of 2019 is stepping down from 24% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2018. As we pass the anniversary of the ForRent acquisition, we expect revenue growth in the range of 14% to 15% for the remaining quarters in 2019. We'll focus on a number of important growth investments in 2019, while at the same time growing our profit margins. Our top investments for 2019 include the independent owner software platform and products that Andy talked about along with the development and launch of the next generation of LoopNet. In addition, we're developing product capabilities within CoStar that we believe will take advantage of significant growth opportunities with both owners of commercial properties and lenders. We'll also continue to build our network of marketplace businesses, including our international operations in Europe and Canada. As a result, we expect total operating costs to increase between 9% and 11% against revenue growth of 14% to 15% in 2019. As in prior years, our advertising spend is expected to be more heavily weighted in the first half of the year, with the second quarter expected to be our largest marketing quarter. As a result, we expect the second quarter to be the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year as was the case in 2017 and 2018. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $495 million to $505 million, that's $0.5 billion for the full year of 2019, which represents 20% growth at the midpoint compared to 2018. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the year of approximately 36% at the midpoint of our guidance range. For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $120 million to $124 million, up 45% compared to the first quarter of 2018. We expect 2019 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $9.80 to $10 based on 36.6 million shares. For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $2.38 to $2.47 based on 36.5 million shares. These ranges include a revised non-GAAP tax rate of 25%. Overall, I believe we're well-positioned in 2019 to deliver strong growth and margin expansion while at the same time making significant investments for the future. I'm excited about our long-term goals of $3 billion in run rate revenue and 40% plus of adjusted EBITDA margins in five years. Now, with regards to our margin improvements, keep in mind, we have a tendency to avoid doing things in a straight line. Accordingly, our margin trajectory may vary considerably from year-to-year. I sound like Rich giving a disclaimer. It is important that when we have attractive investment opportunities, we allow the flexibility and our expectations to pursue those opportunities vigorously. All right. That's enough of me talking. Let's open up the call for questions.
Q - Peter Christiansen: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Andy, there's been some deal activity in Europe recently. And I don't want to point to one deal specifically. But -- and there's also some startup activity in Asia, similar models as CoStar, which I think is the testament to your financial model. But, the things like this, I'm not pointing to one deal specifically, change the calculus in terms of when and how CoStar is thinking about making international more of an investment priority.
Andy Florance: Well, thanks, Peter. We are putting a significant amount of effort into our international operations. You'll see that when you look at our outlook, we have significant capital going into our European and Canadian operations. We think that some of the deals, I believe you're referencing, are interesting, but they're not direct parallels to what we're doing. So, they don't really shift the competitive picture in any which way. There we’re watching that and if something came up, that was really interesting we would participate in that. But we're going to continue to be aggressive but measured internet our international operations. But to it, I'll be over there next week. So, we're watching it and continue to build the operations there. We are -- I think at this point we have eight of the top 10 firms in Canada as clients now. And I think we are 9 or 10 of the top 10 in the United Kingdom. So, we’re doing well and Germany is continuing to do well, France and Spain continue to build there. So, we're watching it but not dramatically shifting.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Oscar Turner: Hey, guys. This is Oscar Turner on for Andrew. My question is on the incremental investments. I was wondering if you can quantify the incremental investment towards a couple of the top initiatives you talked about? And then, how should we think about the incremental revenue growth that those investments can drive and timing of the growth acceleration in, and LoopNet and Apartments?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Let me cover a bit on the investment side and then we can talk a little bit on the outlook from. The bigger ones we’re really focused on this year really the marketplace build-outs both for LoopNet in the U.S. and then the marketplace in the UK, which is the backbone of our Realla business. We think we'll probably have between $20 million to $25 million of investment that will go in to building those platforms out, which includes marketing and other capabilities. Then, we have the independent owners investment that Andy mentioned, which you already have a decent amount of investment going in currently and I think we'll ramp that up by another $10 million or so next year. And then, the build-out of the CoStar platform with owners, lenders, promoting some of the listing manager work we're doing in software with -- along with some more marketing in CoStar, we think those probably another $10 million to $15 million of costs and investments there. When you look at our cost growth, we figured it a little bit less than half of our cost growth. It really has to do with investments we made in 2018 that annualized in 2019, or labor increases, inflation, those types of things. So, little less of the cost growth is for year-over-year and normal business operations and the rest really I think going into new investments that really benefit the future years and future revenue growth. I don’t Andy if you want to talk about the revenue outlook -- estimate?
Andy Florance: Yes. I think that the revenue return on LoopNet is a reasonably short cycle. There’ll be a pretty aggressive focus on that product are investment, that product over ‘19 and ‘20 but we think we’ll see results coming from them in the back half of ‘19 and ‘20 and then ongoing. And then, with the IO market, that's probably the more meaningful results there are probably in 2020. And then, for the increase in the Appartments.com budget, we think that while we are taking share and leading the market, we want to keep the pressure up and accelerate to keeping share to widen them out and increase the lead. So, it's a range of different outlooks on these. And we feel pretty solid about all of them.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. 
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. You’ve outlined goals of reaching $3 billion and run rate revenues by the end of 2023, which implies at least mid-teens annual revenue growth. Can you discus how much pricing will contribute to these growth rates, given your previously discussed plans to eliminate discounting in CoStar Suite and potentially increase rate cards in the multifamily segment?
Andy Florance: Sure. Don't believe the majority -- the substantial majority of this will be price increases. We think that across Europe and Canada and the United States, there are a lot of new revenue opportunities, new customers, additional modules to be purchased, increased purchasing. So, we think a lot of this is share gain and share of wallet. The pricing increases on places like LoopNet, you're shifting your priority from selling a basic ad to a broker for $50, $60 to selling a -- it certainly looks more like an Appartments.com ad with really impactful presentation, sort of the top with more features, and you're selling it to an owner with a lot of economics at stake. And office can be different properties in that mix. And then, new price could go from $60 up to  $6,000 a month. So, there is sort of shift in the budget, shift in the priority or shift in the target audience, shift in the priority. We don't anticipate getting the $3 billion in revenue by simply increasing the same customer’s price for the same product.
Operator: And we have a question from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about the details of the LoopNet site relaunch, whether or not you consider launching a separate brand to differentiate between the up-market and the down-market there? Thank you. 
Andy Florance: That's a good question. And it'll be a little challenging to go into too much detail on it. We have thought about that. We don't think we need to do that. We actually are going to initially go to market really focusing on the branding of CoStar marketing network. Because if you own a say -- expected of new office building in Washington D.C., we're actually providing our customers with a whole range of marketing solutions. We enable that owner to reach the professional community by carrying these ads into the CoStar network. We're carrying them into CityFeet, into Showcase into CoStar, we also power websites through LoopLink. We also have email marketing campaigns through CDX direct, our direct email marketing product. And then, we've got tactical and analytical support where we can produce analysis on the amount of demand and supply for the particular kind of products you're producing and where you may want to position the product and pricing or how you may want to subdivide it, or what terms you may want to consider. And then, we're also uniquely providing the biggest end user audience through LoopNet. So, we can -- and there's two or three other items. But as we put all this together, we're going to simplify it into a network sale, the way we simplify Apartments.com into a network sale. And LoopNet is just one component of this whole range of very valuable marketing solutions for getting a property lease at the best price in the shortest timeframe on huge economics. And then, we think that over time as we shift the way LoopNet looks and feels and it goes -- it becomes much more polished, has more breadth of data, has a lot of content, articles that demystify some of the leasing process and investing process. As we shift it from industry jargon to more plain English, as we add in a lot more sort of exciting shopping characteristics, stuff like where are the best places to eat launch at this particular property, what your community’s going to look like all that kind of stuff. We think the LoopNet brand itself will be a good brand to carry because it's already super well-known. And what we're doing is just moving it more up market and targeting a slightly different audience while continuing to target the original audience. So, we think we're pretty happy with the CoStar marketing network at this point.
Operator: And our next question is from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Your line is open.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys. My question is on the Suite mix in sales. I think, one consequence of having Suite sales people also sell LoopNet was a little bit of extra juice for LoopNet and a little bit less growth in sales for Suite. We get some questions sometimes about penetration rates of Suite and are we getting to a point where those are starting to trickle off. Can you illuminate kind of how do we know that the mix of sales is a result of just kind of effort level being different versus maybe reaching the harder to reach TAM areas of that market?
Andy Florance: Well, when you ask has CoStar reached the saturation point, all I can say is, huh! So, yes, I mean, absolutely not. There are so many different ways that the CoStar product is growing and adding more value. In preparing for this earnings call last night, I was just curious about some of those apartment stats and what the mix of units are different. And I was like, well to go into CoStar and pull some of this data according to company estimate. And man! What a phenomenal product. The ability to like -- actually get a really good data on the mix of apartment units of different sized community, it didn't exist in the product a couple years ago is invaluable. I can't imagine someone investing in the apartment sector without that information. I've been at this -- as we mentioned, I guess since we went public were approximately 25% compound annual growth rate. At the point we went public, there was a lot of discussion about the fact that CoStar was saturated, and five years before that there was discussion around CoStar saturated. I spent my entire career hearing about CoStar is saturated pretty much from the really the first or second year we launched CoStar. In my view, not a chance, not even a chance. Unfortunately, if I work another 20 years like my dad, I will not outlive the potential to saturate the CoStar market. But, it's just one man's wishy-washy opinion, but solidly no.
Operator: Our next question from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Andy or Scott, I just wanted to kind of dig in a little bit on the EBITDA trajectory for 2023. Maybe, Scott, you said, they won't be linear which was always to be expected. But, if you could just talk about the various levers that get you to that 40% target, and maybe you could talk about it by segment in terms of where you think the profitability will come from across the three different business lines?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. So, the margin accretion, clearly you can throttle it pretty rapidly as we just showed this last year. We had 600 basis points. And then, the year, for example, in 2017, when we did the research investments, we slowed it back down and had modest margin growth. It's not inconceivable to see 100 to 200 basis points margin growth a year pretty simply, and still have room like we have in this plan for 2019 to make significant investments for future growth. So, that's all pretty stable from an organic perspective. And I can see us getting -- if nothing else changes and you keep driving this organic growth, you certainly can get over that 40% margin in the business, can capably do that in the five years. The real wildcard in some of this is the amount of acquisition we're going to be doing, the margin profiles of acquisitions that we buy, how that dilutes over time. And so you heard us be a little bit cautious in saying it's 40% plus, and that really depends on what happens with the acquisition path, what those look like, and the timing of them and then how long it takes to move the margins of the businesses we acquire up to our natural margins. When we look at the margins of the different product sectors that we’re in, our marketplaces typically run the very highest margins that are 50% plus margin profiles in the marketplaces and then now with CoStar being in that historically 30% to 40% range, depending on the investments we make, you're going to see both sides of the business grow pretty substantially. I think, you'll see apartments obviously will outpace CoStar in a couple years, given our current growth trajectories. And so, I think you'll get that information in investment side of things coming in the 30%, 40% margins, see the marketplaces as they really continue to scale rapidly, moving up in those 40%, 50% plus margins.
Andy Florance: Furthermore, CoStar is not in any way saturated.
Operator: We’ll go to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone. So, I’m a history major, so sometimes I need a little help with my math. So, I wanted to run some math by -- and you could tell me what I'm doing wrong. If you look at CoStar Suite and how that was about 18% last year, and if you look at -- if you kind of back out 15 to $20 million of revenue from what you did this -- during the fourth quarter, that would seem -- but then, I don’t you don't you know specifically break out, but if you assume that and that would seem to imply something in the upper teens is the organic growth for the quarter. And then, if you look at the net bookings coming in about $50 million in Q4 versus a tough comp and you average that out into 2019, that would be about $200 million for the year, which versus 169 would be up about 18%. I guess what I'm getting at is that the leading indicators on the revenue side seem to be pointing to something closer to 18%, mid-teens going to the upper teens. And I just wanted to run that math by you and see if that was the same math you guys are getting.
Andy Florance: Bill, as I do that math, I start to think that Scott is somewhat conservative.
Scott Wheeler: You have a lot of selling to do this year, people….
Bill Warmington: Always got -- the climbing you’ve been doing has been on a mountain of sand, right?
Andy Florance: Pick up the pace.
Scott Wheeler: We had a better crystal ball on the quarterly sales numbers, Bill, and we watched this for so long. You see how they bounce up and down. $5 million swings quarter to quarter isn't unheard of depending on what we're focused on, what part of the business we're generating, timing of renewals on contracts. So, we always want to make sure that we don't get too far ahead of ourselves when we have a lot of plans for the year. And we'll continue to start the year that way and hopefully we'll get to the point where you can do our forecasting for us, because your numbers will be a lot better than mine, I'm sure as we keep going. But we did have a good quarter in the fourth quarter, but those bounce around between quarters. So, we'll give ourselves time to sell out from under those in the first two quarters of this year.
Operator: And we have a question from Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I was just wondering if CoStar's opportunity is saturated?
Andy Florance: Would you like to have a different question?
Sterling Auty: Yes. Actually, I would, I would. I wondered actually, I think the comment in the call around the investment in sales headcount increase is that they'd be modest in 2019. So, I'm curious where the focus of those added heads will go. And when you think about -- you talked about some of the other increases in budgets and investment. What's going to be the focus of it? I imagine multifamily, you talked about the marketing campaign, but just to wrap our heads around the structure of the investments in 2019?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. They run broadly in line with the numbers I gave a bit earlier on I think someone asked one of the other questions of how much we're spending in the different investments. And those are broadly people driven. The marketing side will be concentrated clearly more on the apartments in the LoopNet side, that's where the marketplace is set. But we are adding a decent amount of resourcing into to LoopNet, into technology. And then, when we say modest for sales, I consider that's less than 10%, which is still -- could be 50 to 75 people easily for sales force of that size. So, our big area of research, we're finding that they're getting so much good productivity, that's one area we don't need to add a lot of people as our Listing Manager products are freeing up resources that we then deploy on to owner and lender products and into helping support LoopNet. So, it's not going to be in the research world, it's going to be mostly in technology and the resources going into the building those investments and in the international marketplaces and independent owner space.
Andy Florance: I have to say that if I were to look at my wish list from beginning of 2018 on the sort of structural improvements, we would like to complete on our sales force, we have -- I feel that we've accomplished a lot of those goals. We have one or two things to do in terms of go-to-market strategy on major accounts in CoStar. But over the years, I don't think I've been to place where I feel like our sales force is more stable than it is now. We've got a good Appartments.com sales team led by Paige Forrest who is a very-experienced sales professional. We got Max Linnington doing a fantastic job. What's happening now is really tweaking a strong group. And we're still probably a year out from anything that would be a major structural change, driven by a change in our acquisition or some other significant change. So, we're in pretty stable place.
Operator: And we have a question from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi. Good evening. So, you talked about building out software platforms to integrate more in the rental leasing process and moving past leads with Appartments.com to more the execution side, which appears to include Cozy. It makes a lot of sense but I also wanted to ask about how this could impact your ability to extract data from the rental cycle. So, beyond just alleviating pain points, is this also about getting and integrating more and better data into your core database?
Andy Florance: That's one of the nice things that we love about the marketplaces. The fact that you're in the data business helps you to perform much more effectively in the marketplace and the fact that you then do well in the marketplace feature data business with some really exciting and valuable data. And it keeps your costs lower overall than if you were in just one or the other of the markets. So, we're able to afford to get data and content that we otherwise probably couldn't afford. We can provide consumers with information and marketplaces that we normally would never pay for, if we didn't have an offsetting revenue stream and information. So, yes, success in the IO market will generate a massive amount of real time and accounting grade data. It also gives you really interesting data or you can understand pricing and relationship to credit and risk and you also will be -- it also could have a potential of generating new sorts of credit information that's very valuable to independent owners. And the independent owner data, the data that you generate from the independent owner side is equally valuable to the institutional players because the renters move back and forth between the different markets. And so, it's all very interesting to both those groups, and certainly a Greystar property that offers a lot in a given market, it also -- its pricing is driven by what's happening in the IO market all around it in the neighborhood. There is high substitution between those two segments. So, yes, if you're data nerd, pretty exciting data coming out of the project on success.
Operator: We have a question from Scott Buck with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Scott Buck: Hi, guys. I was curious of the $1 billion plus you have in cash on the balance sheet, what do you actually need to run the day to day operations? And to the extent that you're carrying a fair amount above that, would that suggest an appetite for doing a larger transaction within the next couple of years? Thanks.
Andy Florance: So, I’ll let -- take that and flip it around. I’ll say that highly likely that we would do -- continue to do acquisitions as we've done successfully for 20 years. And the size of acquisitions we do, we continue to do smaller deals and mid size deals, but we keep gradually escalating the scale of some of the deals we do. So, we believe it's quite likely that we'll use that buying power to do transactions in a reasonably short timeframe. In terms of how much we…
Scott Wheeler: On the cash side, we’re going to get about $400 million of free cash coming out this next year. So, we'll be adding to our cash piles unless we're doing large acquisitions… 
Andy Florance: We need new carpet.
Scott Wheeler: New carpet, $399 million, $10.5 million we’ll generate this year. I think we had $300 million of free cash flow in 2018, it will go to $400 million next year. So, we definitely don't need all that to run the business. We need to get out there and keep adding new capabilities and bigger ones too.
Andy Florance: I think with that we are done with the Q&A period. And thank you all for joining us. And don't forget, CoStar is not saturated. I'm excited about the many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of additional future clients we have ahead of us. Thank you for joining us.

And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead, sir.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you, operator. Welcome to CoStar Group’s third quarter 2018 conference call.

Remember one question, make it a good one.  I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andy Florance: Rich on behalf of all of our shareholders, I want to thank you for those inspirational words.
Rich Simonelli: Welcome.
Andy Florance: Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. We achieved another excellent quarter of solid revenue growth, exceptional margin expansion and continued strong net bookings. Revenue for the third quarter 2018 was $306 million, an increase of 23% compared to revenue of $248 million for the third quarter of 2017. I'm excited to report that we flew past our first $300 million quarter. Our annual revenue run rate now exceeds $1.2 billion. We had strong CoStar Suite revenue growth of 19% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year. Some of that growth is attributed to converting LoopNet Premium Searcher and heavy searchers to CoStar Suite. Today, we have worked through approximately a quarter of the initial 100,000 leads we identified and have seen approximately 11,200 conversions. We have now reached $64 million in annualized revenue from this conversion list. Earlier this quarter, we identified an additional 30,000 commercial real estate professional leads from LoopNet that were previously not on our active lead lists. As we have seen time and again since the LoopNet acquisition closed in 2012, LoopNet is a great source for identifying and refilling our lead list of commercial real estate professionals that we can sell CoStar Suite too. I still believe that over time we can generate hundreds of millions of incremental annual subscription revenue by upselling LoopNet users to CoStar Suite. Apartments.com grew 45% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2018 as we continue to expand our leadership position in this space. Our multifamily annual revenue run rate is now $420 million and we expect to continue to achieve solid organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and through fall of 2019. I should clarify I mean the fourth quarter of 2018. Our profitability continued to expand in the third quarter of 2018. Net income increased 72% year-over-year in the third quarter to $59 million. We generated our best EBITDA quarter in our history as EBITDA jumped 42% sequentially in the third quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of this year. Our adjusted EBITDA was $110 million in the quarter, up 29% over the prior quarter, reaching a 36% adjusted EBITDA margin, so close to 40%. We are confidently on our way to surpassing our goal of 40% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2018. Unless you do not know about four years ago, we set a long range goal of research reaching a $250 million revenue quarter by the fourth quarter of this year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 40%. Clearly with $306 million quarter, this quarter, we are on track to smash through the revenue goal and with the strong margin expansion we're showing we're clearly on track to beat our profitability goals. Should we beat our fourth quarter financial target as we fully expect to, we plan to set brand new equally spectacular inspiring next gen long range revenue and margin targets designed to delight our investors. Company-wide net new bookings were $40 million in the third quarter 2018, an increase of 16% year-over-year over the $34 million we generated in the third quarter of 2017. While net new bookings are up 16%, the number understates the true sales productivity achieved in the quarter. During the quarter and for most of the year, our Apartments.com sales force, which is about half of our sales force, spent most of their time, vast majority of their time, transitioning over 7,100 new ForRent customers to the Apartments.com network. The large amount of revenue we added when we acquired ForRent never appeared in our net new sales numbers, but the previously communicated and expected reduction of duplicative spend between the two sites was counted as negative net new sales in this quarter's bookings numbers. So while we're adding a lot of great revenue and picking up humongous strategic advantage this year, the results show up as somewhat misleading slower bookings. We finished the majority of the conversion work. So going forward we expect the sales booking numbers will reflect to true productivity. There's been a significant accomplishment in the CoStar sales organization this year. Historically, our field sales force sold CoStar predominantly in a combination of an inside sales team and a separate field sales team sold LoopNet ads. The clients really expressed dissatisfaction with so many different points of contact. There is no good reason for doing it this way. It’s just how the go to market strategy evolved historically from the merger of LoopNet. It was a huge learning and behavior shift for the traditionally in for sales force, but it's worked out spectacularly. In total, gross LoopNet sales bookings contribution from the CoStar’s sales force was up 2.8 million for Q3 that’s year-over-year. This is up 261% year-over-year. On a per rep basis, gross LoopNet sales bookings contribution from the CoStar’s sales force was 39,000 for Q3. This is up 249% year-over-year. So they are learning some new things, focusing on customer service, selling LoopNet, but still yielding good productivity and we are aligning the sales force where we wanted to be long term. We announced earlier this month that we had acquired Realla Limited; the UK's largest public portal specializing in commercial property has got the largest collection of publicly available property listings in the United Kingdom. Combining Realla with the CoStar information solution is expected to offer the best of tools for marketing properties, valuations and facilitating transactions. Realla’s business value focuses on providing brokers a broad range of channels to market their listings. Using Realla a broker can create a microsite, generate a PDF, do a blast email distribution, and syndicate their listings on various sites, report leasing progress to owners and market to millions of potential lessees or buyers on realla.com. We are very impressed with these tools and Realla’s strategy for very cost efficiently gathering and managing large volumes of listings. We intend to corporate a significant amount of Realla’s technology into CoStar across Europe and North America. Overall, our Apartments.com numbers are extremely impressive in getting better. In the third quarter of 2018, we generated our best traffic quarter ever with the most unique visitors and leads in a quarter. Our leads, which have proven to be the highest quality leads in the industry, are up 50% year-over-year, which translates into more leases and a better return on investment for our advertisers on the Apartments.com network. According to comScore, the average monthly unique visitors, year-to-date, are up over 37% for the Apartments.com network. This excludes the Move network from both periods. During that same time period, RentPath’s average monthly unique visitors are actually down. Let me repeat, their unique visitors are actually down and then one can assume so as the return on investment of their advertisers. As a standalone site, Appartments.com had more unique visitors than Zillow Rentals in August and September of 2018. Even more impressive Apartments.com network year-to-date visits sit at 404 million according to comScore, up 105 million from 2017, again excluding Move network during both time periods. We have increased the Apartments.com network visits gap over RentPath by almost additional 100 million to a gap of 239 million visits for the first three quarters of 2018. On October 5th, Moody's Investor Service downgraded our primary competitor RentPath. They took the rating Caa1 and it's probably a default rating to Caa1-PD. Moody's has also downgraded the company’s senior secured first line credit facilities to B3 from B2, the second lien term loan was downgraded to Caa3 from Caa2. They revised the outlook for RentPath from stable to negative. Moody's said that the downgrade reflected challenging competitive dynamics in the apartment rental market and a material increase in marketing spend required to compete against a larger and better capitalized competitor. I assume and hope Moody's is referring to Apartments.com there. They also stated they expected the December 2017-2019 maturity of $15 million in the under on revolving credit availability will further pressure the company's financial position and the competition remains challenging. In contrast, Apartments.com has exciting and robust plans for next year and beyond. The outlook for Apartments.com is positive and moving to very positive. The profit contribution from Apartments.com continues to gain strength. Incremental direct profit from our apartment business in the third quarter is up 60% year-over-year. We expect total profit contribution from the apartments business to be up approximately 100% year-over-year. This is double the expected year-over-year revenue increase of 40% to 45%. Net listing detail views are up 32% year-over-year and each listing is being viewed 69% more times year-over-year. With LoopNet our primary priority remains building higher impact Power Ad opportunities for clients, who have very viable properties and want to drive more leads or create a stronger brand presence than our basic ads offer. The new Power Ad placards that drive increased exposure would live in Q3 with significant Power Ad updates ahead in Q4. Typically, these ads are sold to the owners of the properties, who have a much greater stake in economics and are willing to pay a higher price. We have introduced new market based pricing that correlates pricing to the value of the real estate in given market and to some extent also the demand for the ad space. You might find a vacancy in Manhattan with a total lease value as high as $0.5 billion, in Toledo the largest vacancy might be worth one hundredths of that. Accordingly, a top ad New York might sell for 6,500 a month, while an ad in Toledo might price ad at $450 a month, sort of common sense, but we think it will help us to optimize revenue. This fall we plan to rollout market based pricing as well on Premium Lister, our basic advertising placement. Some markets are oversold or saturated and we want to actively manage our inventory. In fact in southern Florida, 82% of all office properties from small to large now advertise. The price per pay listing on LoopLink increased to $46 in Q3 of 2018 versus $31 in Q3 of last year, a 48% increase year-over-year. This has been a result of our proactive price management on LoopNet. CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to be a Toledo force growing revenue, 141% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of last year. Is that number actually correct, Scott? That seems really high.
Scott Wheeler: That’s big.
Andy Florance: Okay, good.
Scott Wheeler: Correct.
Andy Florance: With a continued strong growth and huge potential of Real Estate Manager, the President of Real Estate Manager, Andy Thomas now reports directly to me. We believe that there are a number of very interesting opportunities to accelerate the momentum of Real Estate Manager and expand the scope of this very impactful and successful business. In August 2018, we completed the closing of our research centers in Glasgow, Scotland and Columbia, Maryland. Our centers in London, Richmond, Washington and San Diego have absorbed the workload and the transition has been very smooth. We continue to see more and more brokers and owners entering the quality data directly into CoStar’s self-service Listing Manager. During the quarter, approximately 36% of the millions of updates made were made directly by the broker or owner listing the property. We estimate this represents more than 100 researchers worth of work saved. This trend has the potential to materially reduce the amount of labor we need to invest in order to keep our databases current. In July, Listing Manager was also released in the UK. Today most of our revenue from commercial real estate is – most of our revenues from commercial real estate investors, operators and lenders. Our single largest client is now an owner, who used to be a large brokerage firm. A number of our top ten clients are now investors or owner operators. These clients need accurate and timely data with powerful models to help them understand market opportunities and risks. We are completing an important cultural shift at CoStar, improving our approach to best serving this massive opportunity. Historically, the large component of our analytics solutions were consulting based. We would meet one on one with large investors and lenders and one-off provide them with analytics. This process engaged costly personnel could not be scaled in any way and was not a material contributor to margin and never would be. We have completely restructured and clarified the leadership and mission of our analytics team. Jay Spivey, who has been in leadership with us for 25 years, now leads all of our analytics solutions. We have a clear mission now to devote our best talent to building leverageable digital analytics solutions that serve tens of thousands of clients or millions of clients rather than just a few. My hope is to see an exponentially growing suite of analytics solutions providing insights into risk, CMBS, REITs, portfolios, underwriting valuation, geospatial trends, benchmarking capital markets and more. We just held a three day analytics leadership some at our Richmond research headquarters. About 50 of our best and brightest gathered to plan our potential product roadmap to best serve the industry through innovation. We were focused on solutions that can be delivered during calendar year 2020 or before. Appropriately, we called the session vision 2020. The participants lead 30 presentations focusing on key opportunities for CoStar. I think it'd be helpful to share with you some of the wrap up survey quotes from the SurveyMonkey that our participants did. One said a lot of confidence that this team of people can make some amazing advances between now and 2020, another excitement appreciation for a talented team understanding of growth opportunities, path to grow in revenue from $1 billion to $5 billion plus, another – the motivation to create and build these products is a full 360 cycle, i.e., owner portfolio, lender analytics, investment transaction platform, property evaluation, there is so much opportunity, the sense that I'm not working for a 30-year-old company, but a new startup with best year still in the future. Complete all at the talent across CoStar, we have some of the greatest individuals in commercial real estate. Another noted slightly less helpfully, I gained five pounds this week. And another more productive comment excitement, huge potential for CoStar across many areas in markets, impressed by the quality of the team, happy to be part of the team. Another quote huge appreciation for the amazing talent we have at CoStar. Another one enthusiasm, optimism, commitment and energy. Another one, great optimism for the future. We have some amazing talent here. This was an incredible opportunity to share ideas, check out other groups we’re working on and build relationships with key stakeholders involved in improving the CoStar product. The passion that everyone brought to the meeting was tangible and factious and helps to reinforce while we're far and away the leader in our field. And the best quote, now the real work begins. When update you on the commercial real estate economy, first the good news CoStar has very limited exposure to trade issues with China, 20-foot equivalent units are not an important factor in our business. The third quarter of 2018 ended with commercial vacancies near all time lows. Prices and rents are at all time highs and leasing and transaction volumes setting new records. The ongoing health of the asset class is a result of a durable national economy that tenures into the third longest post-work expansion continues to reliably add 200,000 jobs per month, despite a 3.7% unemployment rate. A low yielding investment environment, which historically low cap rates offer, attractive relative value and restrains – very importantly restrain on the prior developers. Recent rate hikes by the Fed have yet to dent commercial estate’s relative value proposition though CoStar’a analysts and clients are closely watching interest rate movements and CoStar data shows some pricing weakness in gateway markets. Industrial continues to outperform other property types in terms of rent growth and price appreciation. Thanks to national economy and an ongoing shift to consumption patterns towards e-commerce. This disruption consumption patterns has weakened demand somewhat for traditional retail space and rent growth and retail sector has lagged the other property types. However, there's very limited development of new retail space and that's kept retail fundamentals broadly in balance in fact really quite healthy. Trends in the multi-family sector have also been positive. Thanks to shift in home ownership patterns, below trend production of housing units in aggregate and strong employment growth. Apartment rent growth remains above inflation and multifamily product remains in high demand with deal volume set to reach a new record this year despite really aggressive pricing. With office vacancies at record lows and rents at record highs, the rate of office absorption has slowed and rent growth has decelerated, particularly in coastal markets. Investors are growing more cautious and are seeking higher yield deals in secondary markets. Still capital is plentiful and despite interest rate increases by the Fed, cap rates have held steady at record lows across all property types. The path of interest rates will likely determine the fate of the cycle, higher interest rates may erode the relative attractiveness of the asset class, especially for highly priced low cap rate assets in gateway markets. Moreover, tightening by the Fed has always, generally well – always herald the end of economic expansions and slower growth will outright recession will reduce demand particularly for office retail industrial space. For the multifamily sector, however, rising mortgage rates will keep many would be home buyers out of the homeownership market and in rental units. CoStar base case forecast calls for minor weakness in rent growth and price growth, but still growth as demand falters and interest rates rise. [Indiscernible] capitals markets cataclysm, however, we do not anticipate severe rental price losses and we expect commercial real estate to broadly hold its appeal as an alternative asset class. My favorite early warning gauge on market cycles in commercial real estate looks at the thousands of sub-markets for the aggregate percentage with increasing vacancy. Above 50% represents a commercial state recession and concern. The average value of the last seventeen years is 48%. The most recent reading is 41% and that puts us in the lowest quartile of values in the last twenty years. All major sectors in aggregate numbers are strong and surprisingly good data. In fact it's probably about the best commercial real estate fundamentals I've seen in my career. So in conclusion I'm really pleased with our financial and operational results of the three quarters of 2018. I'm excited about getting close to reaching our four year goal. Our team is committed to constant innovation and deployment of new technology to the commercial real estate industry. We approached the business by putting the needs of our clients and users first and then work hard to service them by continually enhancing our comprehensive platform. The good news is the most exciting part of the call is about to begin as I turn it over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Nice, well, thank you, Andy.
Andy Florance: You’re welcome.
Scott Wheeler: Quite a nice build up although I must say talking about the numbers that’s just doesn't get any better than this.
Andy Florance: Yeah.
Scott Wheeler: I am just a warm up actually. Well, that’s good to hear that none of the tariffs are affecting our revenue nor our outlook…
Andy Florance: I keep watching those TE use…
Scott Wheeler: No trade war here. All right, so another strong revenue growth quarter and improving profitability and continued solid operational execution in the business. And as Andy said, we're entering the fourth quarter. We're increasingly confident that we'll exceed our 40% adjusted EBITDA goal, which we committed to investors four years ago way back in 2014, well before my time. As Andy noted, we delivered a solid sales quarter with $40 million in net new bookings, which were up 16% from the third quarter of 2017. All told, we now have three of the last four quarters in which we have achieved net bookings of $40 million or higher. During both the second and third quarters of this year, a significant amount of our sales force time was expanded on converting the ForRent customers to combined apartment contracts, which took our sales teams focus away from new sales. As a result of these conversion efforts, we saw a reduction in net bookings of almost $4 million in the third quarter, which represents net sales erosion upon conversion to the combined contracts. Thankfully with substantially all our conversion efforts complete. We believe the related drag on net bookings is now behind us. The LoopNet marketplace sales were strong in the quarter, which is a result of our continued efforts to improve the product to increase our market coverage through the CoStar field sales force and eliminate historically discounted price levels. As a result gross sales for the LoopNet marketplace grew 45% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017. Overall, as Andy mentioned, when we look at our bookings in our net sales, it's good to see that we don't see any connection to these numbers with the commercial real estate market, which remained strong. Switching over to our revenue results, our growth rate was 23% in the third quarter of 2018 over the third quarter of 2017 coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range. For the year, we expect the consolidated revenue growth to continue at approximately 23%. Looking at revenue by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was an outstanding 19% in the third quarter of 2018 versus third quarter of 2017, a significant increase from 14% annual growth rate we reported just a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we expect the CoStar Suite revenue growth rate to moderate to around 15% year-over-year as we start to lap the accelerated revenue growth period in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the LoopNet conversions and the Xceligent bankruptcy. Accordingly, we expect the growth rate for full year 2018 for CoStar Suite to be approximately 18%. Revenue growth rates in info services were negative 6% in the third quarter of 2018 as expected. This was due to the shutdown of the LoopNet Information Services in the first quarter this year. Excluding the LoopNet Services, our Real Estate Manager and other services in this group grew a stunning 64% in the third quarter over the third quarter 2017. With the shutdown of LoopNet Premium Searcher substantially complete and the strong growth in Real Estate Manager, we expect information services revenue in the fourth quarter to be in line with information services revenue from the fourth quarter of 2017. In other words, flat. That's an improvement. For the full year 2018, we expect info services revenue to decline at a rate of negative 10% to negative 12%, which is a modest improvement from the negative 12% to 15% range we forecast last quarter. Multifamily revenue grew 45% in the third quarter of 2018, including the impact of the ForRent acquisition. Third quarter multifamily revenue of $105 million was essentially unchanged from the revenue of $105 million from the second quarter of 2018 as revenue from the new sales was offset by the planned reduction of certain legacy ForRent services. As Andy mentioned, we made significant progress on both sales and technology integration in the third quarter and now expect to complete this integration by the end of the year. Our expectations for full year growth in multifamily revenue remained in the range of 40% to 45% for the year. Rounding out our services performance, commercial property and land grew 12% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2018, which is consistent with the commercial property and land organic revenue growth from the second quarter of this year. We’re now more than a year passed acquisition of LandWatch, so the total growth rate and organic growth rate for commercial property land earn-out the same. LoopNet sales remained strong and we expect organic growth in the commercial property in land sector in the 13% to 15% range for 2018. Turning to profits, our gross margin came in at 76% in the third quarter of 2018, broadly in line with last quarter. Gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to improve following the closures of our Columbia, Maryland and Glasgow, Scotland research facility in the third quarter. Our outlook also includes some modest savings in facilities and stuff cost associated with these closures. Operating expenses of $163 million for the third quarter of 2018 were estimates and down from $186 million in the second quarter of 2018, primarily on lower third quarter marketing spend. Net income for the third quarter of 2018 of $59 million increased an impressive 72% compared to Q3 3017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is 24%. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $110 million or 36% of revenue. This was approximately $4 million above the top end of our guidance range and 175 basis points above our projected margins. We’re pleased we’re able to maintain this high level of adjusted EBITDA margins throughout the third quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2018 increased 70% to $79 million or $2.16 per diluted share, and include adjustments for stock based compensation and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%. Now we'll take a look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the third quarter of 2018, our sales force totaled 733 people. The decline from the 775 sales people at the end of the second quarter is primarily related to attrition in our multifamily sales team. We expected increased turnover following the integration of the ForRent sales force and are now actively hiring in both the Apartments and the CoStar field sales teams. The renewal rates on annual contracts was 90.2% in the third quarter of 2018, slightly below the 91% rate in the third quarter of 2017. The renewal rate for customers and subscribers for five years or longer was an impressive 96%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 80% of our revenue in the quarter, up from 77% last quarter as we successfully migrated many of the ForRent customers to annual subscriptions, which we have done with prior acquisitions. I'd like to provide a little more operational color on the ForRent integration. I noted earlier, we continue to make great progress converting ForRent customers to the Apartments network service thereby stabilizing the acquired revenue base. We've converted approximately 7,100 customers this year and as expected we lost some revenue in the process. In addition, we continue to wind down some legacy ForRent services we're no longer selling. While bookings are difficult to project, we expect to see multifamily bookings move back up later this year and into 2019 as we get past integration and refocus our teams on new sales. In terms of cost synergies, today, we reduced approximately $30 million in annual costs, which include staffing reductions of approximately 290 people and elimination of other duplicative operating cost. In addition to costs elimination, we successfully migrated the ForRent customer database and fulfillment systems to CoStar's platform during the quarter. We accomplished this in less time to connect our previous multifamily marketplace acquisitions. Our database of information is now feeding and fulfilling all our multifamily marketplace sites and every one of our sites are feeding critical data like availabilities and rents back into our database. This is a very important step integration process and we're thrilled to have completed it so quickly. Back in September of last year when we announced acquisition of ForRent, we said we expected acquired revenue to stabilize in the range of $75 million to $85 million with long-term EBITDA margins of approximately 45% to 55%. I am happy to report that despite having to delay the closing of the acquisition in order to get through the FTC regulatory review, we expect to achieve all of our acquisition objectives at or ahead of schedule. As Andy mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Realla earlier this month, which we expect to be important strategic acquisition UK business. While we have big plans for the platform, we don't expect meaningful revenue contribution in the fourth quarter. We anticipate we'll add approximately $1 million to $2 million of operating cost in the fourth quarter as we begin some early marketing efforts, all of which are included in our outlooks. I will now discuss our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2018. Based on strong revenue and sales results for the first three quarters, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range for the full year to $1.183 billion to $1.189 billion. The midpoint of the range is in line with our prior guidance. This revenue range implies an annual revenue growth rate of approximately 23% compared to 2017. We expect revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the range of $307 million to $313 million, representing top-line growth of around 22% at the midpoint. In terms of earnings, we’re raising our guidance range for the full year of 2018 by $0.14 at the midpoint to a range of approximately $7.95 to $8.03 for non-GAAP net income per diluted share. This is based on 36.5 million shares. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $404 million to $408 million for the full year of 2018, an increase of $6 million compared to our previous outlook. The midpoint of the outlook implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34% for 2018, just an impressive increase of 500 basis points compared to 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in a range of $2.48 to $2.56 and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $125 million to $129 million. Our guidance range implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of 41% for Q4, ahead of our stated 40% goal for the quarter. Overall, I believe the strong results in operational improvements position us well going into the fourth quarter and into 2019. With that, we’ll now open up the call for questions.
Operator: Okay, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey, guys. Good afternoon.
Andy Florance: Good afternoon.
Scott Wheeler: Good afternoon, Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: Appreciate taking the question. Lots of moving parts, pretty much all positive now ForRents behind you and you have made good progress on LoopNet integration and cross-sell. And Andy, appreciate as always the macro comments on the CRE market. Just stepping back maybe big picture, given all that, do you think you can give us a sense of what you think the sustainable organic revenue growth is at CoStar as the business sort of stands today?
Andy Florance: And just to clarify, are we talking long range, short-range?
Andrew Jeffrey: Yeah, I mean, through the – I guess through the cycle recognizing that we're in a bit of an elongated cycle perhaps by historical standards.
Andy Florance: Yeah, I would say more of the same. There is no shortage of people to sell to. There is no shortage of product opportunities. Probably, we have the capital to support our initiatives. So we aren't seeing any sign of saturation anywhere. So we're just working the levers of growing the sales force, improving product, optimizing our pricing. I think I think that word is a euphemism. And so, I think it's – I think it's sustainable more of the same. And in the 32 years, I've been doing this. I think 98.5% of the quarters we've grown. We anticipate more of the same. Do you want to add something to that or just say more specific?
Scott Wheeler: No, the only variability is how fast we can deploy the capital and build the team, grow internationally and then when we get those acquisitions that come in [indiscernible] of integration and then be able to grow on the backs of those. But I mean those are a little more cyclical and lumpy, but we have plenty of opportunities to go after and we just need to keep working hard.
Andy Florance: And then another thing to just remind everybody is that when we acquired ForRent, I sat down and had a chance to talk to the President of ForRent, we'd really been negotiating with Dominion not with leadership of ForRent directly. And I asked the President of ForRent, what is it – what is it like I've never been a cycle running a large ILS. And I said what's it like when you are in a negative cycle and he was surprised and he said well, Andy, we are in a negative cycle. You just don’t see that because you guys are killing it. When vacancy rates are low, ILS spending is down. When vacancy rates are high, ILS spending goes up. So there's some degree that there could be some cyclicality that's inverse on the apartment side and especially when you look at the fundamentals looking like I say Atlanta, Georgia. Interest rates coming up, the Case-Shiller for Atlanta has housing pricing up 76% in five years like it's going to the multifamily. So we feel really quite good about it with a lot of legs to go. More worried about a Black Swan, a thing you can't anticipate.
Andrew Jeffrey: Maybe some counter cyclicality in multifamily…
Andy Florance: Yeah.
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Okay, thank you. Next we go to the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: All right, thanks. Good afternoon. You’ve redirected your CoStar Suite sales force to focus more on existing clients rather than focus just on the LoopNet conversion. Can you talk about how you envision LoopNet conversions progressing from 3Q levels? And then the flip side of that your progress was engaging with your existing customers to prime them for future pricing increase?
Andy Florance: Well, here we are in this public call. So – yes, so we have – it's really just – it's not so much dramatic change. It's focusing on some of the fundamentals that worked well for us for a long time. I think the one big change is that we had to make a fundamental decision. We're going to have two different large national sales forces meeting with exactly the same customers. So the people that buy ads from LoopNet are commercial estate brokers and commercial estate owners. Buying an ad from LoopNet is fairly basic. We generally can hire a new sales person and get them up and running and successfully selling LoopNet, the vast majority of the time, within a matter of months. So the clients expressed to us that really, we don't like being called by fifteen different people and it makes sense that we just have one point of relationship management. So we shifted our sales efforts to teach the CoStar sales force to sell LoopNet into that CoStar customer base rather than having two different sets of people calling in. The CoStar sales force would naturally be in a better position to price more effectively and to sell the higher end ads. And it's – and the numbers show, it's working out well. The other thing is that you're always tweaking, you never want to take your customer base for granted. And when we are in a very strong market, sometimes there is a temptation for the sales force to just be looking to churn the next piece of business. And it’s a huge industry, but it's a small industry and it's important that our sales force continues to build relationships with our clients. And my experience in the industry is that the salesperson that builds relationships long term sells twice as much net as the person that doesn't. So we're really just sort of optimizing the sales force and this positions us for sustained long term growth and good client satisfaction. We do not run every quarter to how can we get the single highest booking this quarter because I'll be gone next quarter since I've been here for so darn long, I tend to think the next year, the next year and the long term right answer. So sometimes we do the hard right instead of the easy wrong.
George Tong: Makes sense. And then the LoopNet conversion piece?
Andy Florance: How are we going to proceed with that? Well, we are going to – I mean the numbers are obviously spectacular so far. And they keep – I guess we’re – if you take the first and the second round, Rich, would this be about $167 million of upsell. And as fast as we upsell these things, they seem to replenish themselves. So it will – we've been doing a number of initiatives with our marketing department buildings, some online videos where we try to figure out who we’re targeting and then we present value proposition based on who they are. So we’re doing a little more digital selling and preparation. But we're continuing to focus on it. And you know as we stated earlier, I think it is a multi-year effort. I think it’s something that will be work in this LoopNet conversion list for at least another three years and then it will move into a long term sustainability where five million people coming in a given month often. And some percentage of them, they'll begin their customer journey with us in the LoopNet interface. And then when they keep returning, we can identify the market to them and then migrate them up to CoStar. 99.5% of the people coming to LoopNet never see any upgrade messages, any upsell messages. They don't know there's a CoStar because they’re end users. We want to keep it that way. And we really are sort of laser targeting the folks we really think are consuming at a level they should move up to professional product. So I hope that answers the question.
Operator: All right and thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Ridley-Lane: Sure. I was wondering if you could discuss the reasons for the deceleration in the multifamily revenue growth. Maybe if you could quantify the revenue drag from the products you are discontinuing within ForRent, just trying to get a little bit more clarity on that.
Andy Florance: Yes, obviously, the – let’s just keep our bearings here. Obviously, the growth is excellent in the multifamily space and continues to be very strong and exceptional, so historical – all-time highs for anyone in the space. And we anticipate that we've got a lot of exciting stuff for years to come here. As we brought in ForRent, we bring in that revenue slug upfront. It does not pass through our sales bookings numbers. We upfront when we acquired them we never had any expectation that we would retain 100% of the revenue. Often you'll have someone buying a top paid top level ad on both sides. And if someone's you know they will we expect that there will be some churn off where they won't buy top level ads on two sites from us. We can retain a lot of that, but not all of that and we sort of anticipated that. And as that that burns off, you have – it comes out in our sales booking. So it goes in silently, but it comes out in the sales booking number. So that creates 4 million some drag in the quarter against the multifamily bookings roughly. And then the other thing is that when you're bringing in two sales forces and taking your message out there, your number one goal is to solidify the revenue and solidify the relationships. You want to get out there, make sure that you are visiting every one of these new customers coming to Apartments.com network and that you have them in there. And I don't have the exact cancellation numbers for ForRent, but I would imagine they were probably 400%, 500% higher than ours…
Scott Wheeler: Definitely higher than ours, yeah.
Andy Florance: And so we want to take that revenue, bring it in and bring it long term into the super low industry leading cancellation rates or the super high renewal rates we enjoy. So that's what this – as they do all that, they're not going to simultaneously be out, go into another customer base at the same productivity level. So now we move into the fourth quarter, they've got all that stuff behind them largely. I think there is 200, 300 out of 7,100. But now, they'll be focusing back out on the opportunity. And again one of the big opportunities right in front of us is there are still, I guess, 7,000 some firms that are buying only products from RentPath, which is a huge opportunity for us. And then the other things that that these firms have been losing share to us have shown us and that we've learned is that there is a ton of share below 100 units. That's where most of the market is. And so we're focusing on that opportunity. So a positive outlook, feeling good about it.
Operator: Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone.
Andy Florance: Well, good afternoon.
Scott Wheeler: Good afternoon, Bill. We’ve been expecting.
Bill Warmington: Excellent, since I – I only get one question. I have to make sure I'll let you know that I'm expecting spectacular inspiring in next gen answers from you on that question.
Andy Florance: Sounds like compound question coming.
Bill Warmington: So the $40 million in bookings, you've alluded to $4 million in ForRent revenue that went away for the quarter. I want to make sure that because I believe that was also one of the offsets in Q2 that was about $4 million in ForRent revenue and about $1 million in LoopNet Premium Searcher cancellations that netted against last quarter's figure. I wanted to just get a sense for whether there – that $4 million is in this quarter? And then if there are any other offsets that are worth highlighting for this quarter.
Andy Florance: Yes, so Bill you've definitely got the fact straight there. We had about $4 million of this erosion that we saw as we're converting each quarter. No other offsets or ad backs, the LoopNet info run off is down at negligible amount. It's not really enough to talk about. So nothing really left for there. I think what you're seeing too is a little bit of what we saw last year in Q3 where in the CRE business, you come into July and August and you just see a slowdown in activity and slow down of flow through, which you saw last year in the CoStar and some in the LoopNet bookings. So we saw that again in the third quarter of this year. And when you dig on to that and you look at what the sales force is selling to some of the stats Andy gave, we're encouraged that they're – year-over-year the sales people are selling 35% more this year in net than what they were selling last year in commercial real estate as CoStar LoopNet combined. We simply need to get some more of them in-house, so we can keep selling more. And we didn't see as you heard the sales force numbers were down slightly, sequentially here lot and apartments, but some in CoStar as well. So we'll need to keep pushing those back into the sales force and that will help us continue on the good productivity piece that we're seeing, but I think you got the ad backs right there.
Operator: Okay, thank you. Next we go to the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Pete Christiansen: Hey, guys.
Andy Florance: Hey, Pete.
Pete Christiansen: Andy, I want to compare kind of your M&A thoughts from two or three quarters ago. It seemed like you thought valuations were a little unjustified and we kind of – the M&A was going to be put off for a while. I don't know the Realla be isn’t that large, but just wanted to see where you are you are right now in terms of thinking M&A. Are there more opportunities perhaps overseas versus domestic? Just a sense would be helpful.
Andy Florance: Sure, it’s a good question because probably the temperature is changing a little bit here. And so we did the Realla deal. And that's an example of a deal that is not a big deal. It's not the size of an Apartments.com. It's a much, much smaller deal. But what we're interested in there is the technology of the people and the positioning. And there are – we probably have 10, 12 deals right now that we're very interested in. And so, it's probably a little bit more aggressive now than it has been. But if you are – in particular if you are looking at some of these companies that bring technology that are operating at relatively small basis that you can leverage into a much bigger platform. The relative value is the issue not where you are in the cycle. So when you do a deal like Realla, it doesn't matter it’s the top of the cycle or bottom of cycle, the cycle is the cycle and it probably – where we are in the cycle probably matter, more when you are looking at billion dollar deals. And there we have to think hard and carefully, but we still consider those. So we are not seeing again reiterate, there's – I look at our younger commercial estate analysts and economists and they talk about rent growth slowing as a disaster and like you should see what's like when rent growth falls, this is actually really good environment, the best of ever good, so we don’t see anything falling off right away. So we continue to look at very aggressively at smaller deals right now and we probably will have news there and probably at a much greater pace than you've seen in the last year or so.
Operator: Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Incorp. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon guys how are you doing?
Andy Florance: Good, hi Brett.
Scott Wheeler: Hi Brett.
Brett Huff: Good. Thanks for taking the call. Bookings question part two. I know a couple have asked about this. General question is one of the reasons, I think, investors at least have told us – they have told us they really like how things are going is that the bookings kind of quarterly annualized net new have just kind of gone up in a pretty steady fashion and that’s driven confidence in the future organic growth. Can you articulate to us kind of the main five, six or whatever the number is, the reasons you are thinking the net new bookings will be up next year or year after, whatever it is. And that’s the main thrust of my question. And the second is, Scott you mentioned that there were 35% more sales going on. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you mean for that. And I'll leave you guys there. Thank you.
Andy Florance: Yes so I think people sometimes look for – obviously this is a great business with a strong track record and continues and has the ability to sustain these high growth rates for a huge period of time, why? Because it is a $50 trillion, $70 trillion global asset class and we’re the largest player in that space. And we’re just at the early days of creating those solutions. And clearly, we’ve shown that we’re able to build compelling products that have a huge advantage – that have just a huge advantage over some of the slower competitors. So now we – if we just kept going up every single quarter like clockwork, you might say, hey, are these made of returns? But they're not, there is some volatility and we do things periodically like buying ForRent that create noise in the number so and so forth. But the market is strong, our competitive advantage is unquestioned. We have shared some news with you that should be exciting to you on other competitive fronts. I don't want to do schadenfreude but it's a reality.  And then we have a really robust product pipeline. There are a lot of opportunities out there. There's also a lot of M&A opportunities out there. And virtually, everything we're looking at in M&A is not about picking up the revenue of the company we're buying, it's about building out the platform. It's about picking up one of these companies and building a solution that reaches a much broader audience and also as an interconnected solution, so that the inputs already exist in our system and outputs feed another part of our system. So there's a lot of good stuff here, it's a great company. And while bookings sequential stair-step precision in the bookings growth is important, it's not everything, so. 
Scott Wheeler: And then to your question on the 35% Brett, when we look at it on a per rep basis for the CoStar sales force, now that they're selling both CoStar and LoopNet on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, on a per rep basis, they're selling 35% more in net bookings than they were selling last year. The biggest piece of that growth is in LoopNet is where they've been directed in selling a lot more and still growth in CoStar, low double digits on individual productivity and the rest have been LoopNet.
Operator: Thank you. Next we go to the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Sterling Auty: Yes thanks. Hi guys. 
Andy Florance: I just fairly recognize you there. 
Sterling Auty: Wanted to circle back to the ForRent item, because I wasn’t clear. Some of the questions you referred to is $4 million hit to bookings. Another question was it was a hit to revenue. I just want to clarify and make sure understand was there hit in bookings and revenue in the quarter? And if so, did you guys realize it was going to be that magnitude when you give the guidance coming into the quarter? And how do we think about kind of the bounce back as you kind of convert it? So in other words, is there kind of a de-bounce in that productivity so you get may be some tailwind here in the fourth quarter?
Scott Wheeler: Great, yes thanks Sterling. Let me clarify the pieces there. The $4 million drag that we talked about was a bookings drag that was in the net new sales bookings number. There is a parallel drag, I'll call it to revenue, and that has to do more the our products that were sold by ForRent previously that we chose not to continue. Those we never count in our bookings at all, those are revenue that comes with the acquired company that will tradeoff of over the course of the year. And it will offset the growth in our bookings. So that's why when you saw the revenue in the Apartments multifamily growth rate slowed in Q3 because you picked up a bigger chunk of that in Q2 right after the acquisition, and then this sort of non-bookings revenue that we're not selling anymore that erodes as people’s contracts come up. So that's the revenue drag, which goes parallel to this bookings conversions issue. So hopefully I’ve cleared what those two pieces are. And yes, we did expect that to happen early in the quarter, the that bookings came out fairly strong that we were happy with how the sales force actually sold a great amount of new product even while they're doing the conversions. So we're happy with how the ForRent and the Apartments combined forces are selling together and they are working together in their own individual territories. And now the former ForRent sales folks are ramping up their productivity and are about 75% to 80% productive as our historical Apartments reps in selling new business. So we're seeing really good progress there.
Andy Florance: Yes, and it's really important that people keep their eye on the big picture, which this acquisition has exceeded our expectations. And it's difficult to put a precise revenue number on what revenues actually attributable for ForRent today. But our senses is that this deal was a – ultimately ends up being a single-digit EBITDA acquisition, multiple EBITDA acquisition that has tremendous strategic advantage to the company. So these are the kind of deals we love, and they set the stage for long-term growth of the company. So as we beat the expected burn off revenue numbers, it would be a mistake for people to take those as negative.
Operator: Good, thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll go to the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon: Great, thank you. Andy, does the acquisition in the UK set the stage for more of a focused on the international market? And if so, could you maybe give us a sense of how do you view the expansion? Is it going to be more organic, more M&A, a combination of both and, of course, the time line on any future expansion internationally? 
Andy Florance: Sure. So yes, it does show our willingness and our commitment to continue growing the platform. I don’t want to get into too much detail for competitive reasons on exactly what we plan to do. But we do think that there is opportunity to expand our footprint internationally pretty quickly using some technology and methods that reduce the initial cost of going to market in reducing an initial risk. So we think it's possible to take couple of hundred people and add 50 countries with some footprint. So we're looking at that we're looking at companies that will support that. I do feel that the more I’m in the business the more you're out there looking at the different players. You do feel that a company that is building up all these different software sets, and models, and customer bases and interactions between these different components, this is a game of software and software is about scale and its global scale. So I think the future is providing us an international level. We don't want to be measured about it because our EBITDA growth in the United States is awesome. And you want to keep harvesting your EBITDA in the United States, but then keep our eye on the fact that 10 years from now, we could have half of our EBITDA being global. And we would never want to give that up. It's just very similar to when we were making a lot of money in Washington, in New York, there was some skepticism about taking it out to the whole country. And the numbers in the secondary markets in the United States in the earlier years as we expand our New York and Washington were de minimis, but they're not de minimis now. And we're excited about the technology is changing a little bit, and the market is changing little bit, opening up some new opportunities for us.
Operator: Thank you. I’m sorry. 
Andy Florance: No, go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go to the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Stephen Sheldon: Yes hi guys. Good evening.
Andy Florance: Hi, Stephen.
Stephen Sheldon: Wanted to ask you about margins by business, you noted, I think, that profit in multifamily will likely be up. I think you said close to 100% in 2018, which is pretty significant. So I guess, can you help us frame where adjusted EBITDA margins in multifamily could roughly end up this year? And how you're thinking about continued margin expansion in that business over the next few years post kind of ForRent integration?
Scott Wheeler: Sure. We're pretty happy to see the expansion that we're seeing now, especially when you're going to big integration like that, and the acquired business was making little of any margin. And so we took on a big slug of cost and had to rationalize that and keep the revenue at the same time. When you look at the progression [ph] through the year, it's really improved obviously as we've taken those out. And when you look at the associate the average margin for the business in the fourth quarter, you see that multifamily is going to be right there broadly in line with where the total business is going to be the fourth quarter. Now you could say okay, yes but that’s real low real marketing spend, which is true. So that business is still not going to be in the profitable range of the entire business for the year. But I think when you see us at least hitting one quarter now on average, we’ll hit more of those as time goes on. We still believe that the margin profile of multifamily can be equivalent to the average margin of the entire business on an overall basis. We've got to scale a little bit more.
Andy Florance: We got to take a look at it like loop net margin, or a…
Scott Wheeler: Yes those are much higher.
Andy Florance: Buy sell margin, or those sorts of margins, they’re much higher. And that’s where this business…
Scott Wheeler: 50 to 60.
Andy Florance: Difference in this business does that goes through a $1 billion. 
Scott Wheeler: Yes it’s a very high scale. So hopefully that gives you some clarity. We're happy with the way we're pacing and the business is performing well.
Operator: Yes thank you. Next we go to the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Pat Walravens: Great. Thank you. Thanks for the detailed discussion so far guys. Can I go back to pricing around the CoStar Suite. I would love to understand better. I hear this concept of waiving the escalations. And just does that ring a bell, by the way?
Andy Florance: We are familiar with all these terms by time to time.
Scott Wheeler: Did someone wave your escalation?
Andy Florance: Yes that’s not happy to deal.
Pat Walravens: But for this year, how are you thinking about that? And what were you doing this year in sort of in 2019 and beyond, how is it going to work?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, when we started this at the very end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter, we really eliminated the discounting in many forms. Some of it was in bundle discounts some of it was in just manager discretionary discounts; some of it was in just selling partial products, which really resulting in discounts; and then some were in annual escalations that we had, which resulted in essential discounts. So this was all happening at the same time in the early second quarter where we said, we're done with the discounting programs anymore, all of those go away. And now we manage the business to a very defined rate card. We have very defined escalations on an annual basis. And then now we're starting to take some of the very deepest of the discounts on a combined product basis, and go back to those clients, look at the value proposition. And those that have strong value propositions are now signing up for three years escalations or three-year increases to get up to rate card over a multiyear time frame. And we probably did about 30-or-so of those deals in the last month and a half to start to get our feet wet on that. So those are all part of this, first, firm up your pricing, firm up your rate card and now go start to take the deeper discounts historically and move them up to rate card because you've seen the investment we put in the product with all the analytics, with all the new research centers and all these things over time and we're seeing clients are willing to step up to that as they recognize that value. 
Andy Florance: Yes, I just can't help but chime in here.
Pat Walravens: Please do.
Andy Florance: So the word waiving escalations is completely foreign to me and I don't understand it. So we went through a phase where you had all of these LoopNet folks who were getting really marginal product and paying very little. And you want to bring them over to the CoStar platform. And we stretched down in pricing to include them in the business. Then you had Xceligent out there operating for an extended period of time. And we estimate that for every dollar they were charging someone, they were spending $5 to produce it. So they created this artificial price point out there. And again trying to bring people into the system, we extended discounts for a period of time. The reality is our products on the commercial real estate side provide an owner, or broker, an appraiser, irreplaceable huge value. And they are a major bargain. And our renewal rates would instruct any economist that we are under pricing these products. And the difference between – only a junior salesperson who doesn't understand the market sells these lower-priced things, you have the more senior salesperson who comfortably signed a much higher point. So over time, you would expect to see the pricing growth continue to reflect the value we are providing folks. And the ROI on investment in our products, half of our clients is phenomenal no matter what we do with escalations of a couple of points to each year or more. So the era of trying to meet Xceligent's pre-bankruptcy pricing is behind us. And yes, enough said, we feel strongly about that one. And let's get Pete in here for cheating second question.
Scott Wheeler: Pete how do you slip back in there?
Operator: Okay, let’s go back to the line to Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead. 
Pete Christiansen: Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Very quick question, I promise I won't hold up anyone much longer. But you talked about headcount going down, attrition and then you're actively hiring. Just generally, how is hiring going, has it been to upper lately?
Andy Florance: Hey that’s a good question because always you’d expect at 3.7% unemployment you get some problems. I'm very grateful that we moved to Richmond with a research center we did because that's probably where a lot of competition would occur. We went into – like the engagement surveys in Richmond show that that center is working really well, folks are pretty happy there, I think, its great feel and energy down there. That offsets our huge sort research hiring needs. I would not want to be hiring in some – the researchers in some U.S.A. right now. On the sales front, I think, I have no indication that our hiring is not going well. It is just a question of we've been really busy and a lot of change and we're not afraid of change. So you put two big competing sales forces together in the apartment industry, we're experienced enough to fully expect churn and reactions and we manage and at the best we can and then you just deal that and going keep on hiring. I think we communicated that earlier. The other thing is that I always believe it’s good to be real straightforward the sales force about what the expectations for the job are. And it's to sell the correct solutions to the right people and to maintain a good positive relationship with those customers, and we don't yield on that. And if that causes 10 people in the CoStar sales force to leave, we'll be better off next year. And so it's on track. I think we probably need to continue sort of tweet the organization structure to be able to do with the growth but I would say it's going well. And next year is probably easier than this year in terms of the number of changes happening in the sales force, which even when no change occurs one year in the sales force, all sales forces believe lots of changes occurring.
Pete Christiansen: And it’s just difference for those.
Andy Florance: Yes. But anyhow thank you Pete.
Andy Florance: And so with that, I think, we will conclude the earnings call. And please stay tuned, the suspense is palpable, will CoStar reach its 40% margin goal and the adjusted EBITDA margin goal in the fourth quarter? Please standby and we'll talk to you at the yearend earnings call. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference to your host Richard Simonelli. Please go ahead.
Richard Simonelli: Thank you, operator and welcome to the CoStar Group's second quarter of 2018 conference call. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, our CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I like to share some very interesting and important items that can actually have a positive effect on your life. Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated today in our July 24, 2018, press release on our second quarter results and company's outlook as well as in CoStar's filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and we assume no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to all of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are shown in detail on our press release issued earlier. The press release is available on our Web site located at costargroup.com. As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color on our Web site, where you can also find CoStar's Investor Relations page. Please refer to the press release on how to access the replay of this call. Remember just one question, so make it a good one. I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andrew Florance: Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. This month marks CoStar's 20-year anniversary as a public company making this our 80th earnings call. Congratulations to those of you who bought our stock on July 1, 1998 when we listed on NASDAQ at $9 a share. The only thing better than your 4000% gain is the thrill you enjoyed listening to more than one hundred hours of these excellent information packed CoStar Group earnings calls. On our IPO road show in 1998, we had less than $10 million in trailing full year revenue. Back then many investors expressed some skepticism to our claim that CoStar Group had a $100 million potential total addressable market. In June of 2018, we achieved our first $100 million revenue month and we're now at $1.2 billion revenue run rate. In the second quarter of 2018 our Apartments.com business alone generated its first $100 million revenue quarter. Revenue for the second quarter 2018 was $297 million an increase of 25% over revenue of $237 million for the second quarter of 2017, Year-over-year net income in the second quarter of 2018 doubled to $44 million and non-GAAP net income which excludes one-time costs associated with the acquisition of ForRent was up 114%. I strongly believe we will meet our 40% adjusted EBITDA margin goal for the fourth quarter of 2018. Our strong momentum in sales continues, bookings in the second quarter of 2018 were very strong as we generate $45 million an increase of 23% percent year-over-year versus the $37 million we achieved in the second quarter of 2017. Just one year ago that $37 million had been the best net new sales quarter we'd ever had. Our commercial property and land marketplaces had their best sales quarter ever in the second quarter of 2018 with a year-over-year revenue increase of 105%. This increase featured significant sales of LoopNet Premium Lister and Power Ads on the loopnet.com. With the integration of the CoStar and LoopNet databases, we were able to eliminate LoopNet's information product and focus LoopNet entirely on being the best possible marketing solution for commercial real estate. We're making significant enhancements within the LoopNet marketplace month in and month out, so we can further capitalize on this significant opportunity. Since last year's integration the number of views per advertised property has doubled. We're shifting our priority to developing and selling our higher end LoopNet power ads such as our gold platinum and diamond level advertising. The diamond adds LoopNet reach the end user markets of its tenants and small investors more effectively with larger ads that soared to the top of relevant search results. They are enhanced with immersive virtual reality walkthroughs, drone shots videos and more. They will also appear prominently throughout CoStar in order to make a strong impression on our broker audience as well. As we invest in growing our news service the diamond ads will reach this audience through our newsletters and news Web site. Many landlords advertising, let's believe that reaching the professional audience [indiscernible] within CoStar Suite is equally as important as reaching the tenants themselves as the vast majority of leased transactions over 5000 square feet involve tenants represented by professional brokers. We are already beginning to sell diamond ads on LoopNet for as much as $2200 per month which is 60x the $35 per month we currently average on LoopNet. We believe that properties advertised on LoopNet and CoStar are leasing and selling faster, so there is real economic value in return on our clients advertising investment. Conversely vacant or unleased space is incredibly expensive for landlords, so reducing that downtime by marking the space with us provides an immediate and substantial return on investment. We're also now focusing on selling to owners instead of just the brokers; owners typically have 94% of the economic interest at stake in a deal compared to a listing broker who has just 1,5% of the economics after they share the commission with other brokers or his or her firm. We believe the return on investment argument resonates much more strongly with owner who has the most at stake. We believe that our commercial real estate advertising products are countercyclical. When an owner has a leasing crisis in $250 million property a one of a kind, $2200 a month effective marketing solution is a no brainer. While the CoStar sales force remains focused on generating strong sales growth for the company we also have them heavily focused on pricing integrity and relationship development with our existing clients. As we've mentioned in the last earnings call we're holding the line our pricing policies and not accepting discount or under license contracts. As a result, we've seen an 80% increase in the average price per new broker user licensed over the past six months. In January of 2018 with discounts incentives, we were licensing new brokerages at $255 dollars per broker. But by July, we're licensing new brokerages at $466 per broker. This increase improves our intermediate and long-term revenue, but does come at a cost of some reduction a short-term contract volume. We average 624 total new CoStar contracts per month at the beginning of the second quarter and that dropped to 474 new contracts at the end of the second quarter. So the trade-off is approximately 25% overall lower contract volume, but they're at a significantly higher price points. Beginning in March of this year, we felt it was important to incentivize our sales team to visit each of their CoStar customers provide training, build stronger relationships and demonstrate the exceptional value of our CoStar Suite service. We are focusing our sales force on relationship development right now for a number of important reasons. We've added tens of thousands of new users in the past 12 months. I feel it's important that these new and existing clients feel that we're in a partnership with them and focused on their success. Working closely with our clients, we expect to gain stronger referrals, lower cancels, better learn our clients' needs, up sell other products and more accurately license and price our products as contracts renew. It's working from April to June in the second quarter 2018, we saw a 75% increase in the number of face to face meetings our salespeople had with our clients focused on relationship development. As we do with Apartments.com sales force, we carefully track these meetings and get client feedback. This resulted in an improvement of our net promoter score each month in the second quarter. In June 2018, our net promoter score reached 9.1 on a 10 point scale, very positive referrals. I firmly believe that while this focus does not maximize short-term sales productivity. It does create greater customer satisfaction and relationships definitely increase intermediate term and long-term sales results. I believe it also significantly widens our competitive mode. Today we kicked off a multi-day strategy session here at our headquarters with several dozen of Cushman & Wakefield's global leaders building strategies to best leverage CoStar technologies, information platforms and marketplaces to fuel the growth of their global platform. We believe it is positive for the industry and our business for the number 3 commercial real estate brokerage in this space Cushman & Wakefield are one of the top three players to be going public. Cushman is only one of only three really large global brokerage firms they have got almost $7 billion in revenue 48,000 employees in 70 countries and an awesome brand that dates back over 100 years. We know the company aims to continue to drive growth by investing in its technology to best serve clients and deliver margin expansion as it drives efficiency with recently acquired businesses. Apartments.com continues to strengthen its lead as the number one apartment Internet listings service. We achieved our first $100 million quarter, which is remarkable since we only entered the multi-family marketing business just four years ago with the acquisition of Apartments.com which at the time only had annual revenue of $85 million. During the second quarter, we once again achieved all time highs and visitors and traffic. Our SEO performance remains remarkably strong measured on May of this year based on Google rankings list of 10,000 apartments keywords, apartments had 73% of the number one slots. That's 7x the 7% Zillow has or 25x, 24x the 3% RentPath has. As reported by comScore during the second quarter of 2018, Apartments.com averaged 15.2 million unique monthly visitors, an increase of 37% percent year-over-year. Apartments.com had 3x more unique monthly visitors than Apartment Guide. This 4.9 million unique visitors represented a decrease of 11% during the same period. Excluding traffic from move in both periods, our apartments.com network averaged 47.6 million visits per month up 33%. In June of 2018, our entire Apartments.com network had more than doubled the number of unique visitors 112% more to be precise than the RentPath network according to comScore. We had 2.5x the total number of visits ever RentPath in June as well. Our network produced a stunning number of leads, it produced 41% more leads in the second quarter of 2018 than we did a year ago during the same period. Since we believe we have the highest quality leads in the industry, this should make a listing on Apartments.com network even more valuable. In June of 2018, we announced that we are resuming our partnership with News Corp. subsidiary Move Inc., to power exclusively apartment community listings on Move's Web sites, Realtor.com and Doorsteps.com. Move had partnered with apartment list in the first part of 2018, but that partnership failed quickly. Our partnership with Move significantly broadens the distribution of the apartments listed on Apartments.com. Move's Realtor.com brings us almost 7 million unique potential renters a month. We believe this will result in the most cost effective use of advertiser dollars as their listings will enjoy increased exposure and will be available now on up to 11 different apartment Web sites. In June we delivered our best gross sales month ever for Apartments.com, one of our primary priorities for our apartments.com team this year has been integrating the legacy apartments.com sales force with a new sales team additions from ForRent. The ForRent business is being integrated quickly and effectively. We initially set a goal of integrating ForRent's operations clients and software within 12 to 24 months. Given the great progress we're making, it looks like we will complete the integration in less than 12 months. Our integrated sales force has been performing really well from the start. They're selling an integrated network and advertising package that we expect further increases exposure for our clients and generates more leads for them. Since the ForRent acquisition closed in February, we have met with all of our ForRent customers multiple times. This has created enormous goodwill and decreased cancellations dramatically. Since we integrated the sales force average monthly ForRent cancels were almost 35% less than the monthly average of ForRent cancels in 2017. We've converted over 4100 ForRent clients to bundled Apartments.com network contract stabilizing and retaining the associated revenue. At the end of the quarter, we had 48,500 apartment communities investing in the Apartments.com network. That is up from approximately 18,000 communities four years ago. We're now very focused on that record setting 50,000 community milestone. Once again, we had a strong presence at last month's National Apartment Association annual conference in San Diego resulting in millions of dollars of net new sales. We had enormous interest from property managers from around the United States, which resulted in thousands of booth visitors, leads captured and demos delivered. We have already generated over 3.2 million in net new sales from NAA conference with more sales still rolling in. The highlight of the conference for me was the very positive feedback I heard from multiple principals of major clients on the value they received for their partnership with Apartments.com. The CoStar real estate manager solution is now an established leader in facilities project management, lease subtraction and lease accounting. We continue to add to a strong list of Fortune 1000 companies as customers including top financial, industrial, healthcare, retail and service companies join us. Additionally existing customers continue to expand their use of our services as they seek to meet the new ASC 842 leases standard. Over 350 companies are currently utilizing the service. In fact a couple of the companies on today's earning calls use it. CoStar real estate manager sales continue to impress with year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of 2018 of 118%. This year Co-Star Real Estate Manager is expected to exit Q4 2018 at approximately $43 million revenue run rate with margins approaching 25%. We've purchased Real Estate Manager in October of 2011 when it was known as Virtual Premise. You may recall this was right in the middle of the period that our acquisition of LoopNet was under careful, very careful review by the FTC. This shows we're able to do more than one thing successfully at that time. We paid $17 million for Virtual Premise which had approximately $7 million in revenue, so we paid 2.5x revenue. I think you would agree that assessed business growing positive profitably through $43 million in revenue at 118% growth rate is now worth a lot more than $17 million we paid for it. The purchase of Real Estate Manager builds our track record of making quality acquisitions that are selective that expand the total addressable markets we operate in, growing revenue and profitability of the company and strengthening our unique commercial real state platform, this has ultimately been a major contributor to increasing shareholder value. As we manage our capital and the balance sheet of CoStar and look for our next M&A opportunity, we're careful we do not overpay for businesses or make recklessly risky bets. I'd rather wait and identify quality businesses that have the high potential to integrate into our platform and that can grow our add significant value to our customers and shareholders. This is what leads to a successful M&A like CoStar Real Estate Manager, Apartments.com, LoopNet and many, many others. I want to update you on our research operations. Our ability to collect and curate valuable commercial real estate content is our primary core competency. Our research operations continue to perform really well. In order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of our research process, we're closing two major research centers and consolidating them into other centers. In August 2018, we'll be closing our research center in Glasgow, Scotland and consolidating it into London. At the same time, we're closing our research center in Columbia, Maryland. Our centers in San Diego, Richmond and Washington will pick up the Columbia center's workload. Both of the Glasgow and Columbia leases expire this fall. CoStar listing manager continues to be very [additive] [ph] to CoStar's research process. Many brokers like to have direct control over when and how their listings are presented. With brokers self entering quality information, it frees up our researchers to continue to gather even more information as they perform their monthly update cycles. We are not seeing any slowdown to the robust start from broker entry we had in the first six months of CoStar Listing Manager. In June, 23,000 new listings were entered directly into CoStar by brokers as 38% of all new listings we experienced. In the same month, 36% of all listings are 297,000 were added directly by brokers and owners using CoStar Listing Manager. We believe as brokers learn more about Listing Manager their participation will increase even more. Our CoStar product development teams have been working hard to deliver a significant update to the core CoStar platform. We expect this will provide a far more intuitive user experience to search, filter and view results, generate reports and produce visually stunning analytic charts covering every important measure within the search results. The upcoming release is not just a big leap forward aesthetically, but it's been optimized for serious performance. Searches resulting in tens of thousands of records will typically return in less than a second. In fact, it's often measured in milliseconds. Yesterday, I ran a series of searches in the updated CoStar and initially thought something was wrong because the screens weren't really changing as I did the queries. Look more carefully it turned out it was actually moving so quickly I couldn't see the results coming back. The results just seemed to appear instantly. Clients really like speed in software, so they're really going to like the updated CoStar. They should. So there is one person who has listened to every one of CoStar's 80 earnings calls. It's Frank Carchedi, who was our CFO when we went public until he retired in 2007. Frank is addicted to CoStar, so Frank unretired in 2009 for an extra nine years and has played a valued role in our M&A team. He's also successfully managed a number of our acquired companies. We all want to thank him for making CoStar's incredible journey from $5 million of revenue a year to $100 million a month possible. It would not have happened without him. Frank is going to be retiring this fall and I'm confident that even in retirement, he'll be there for our 100th earnings call watching over his CoStar shares. I will make sure, I speak loudly so he can hear me. This summer, the U.S. economic expansion has entered its 10th year. Yet growth seems to be accelerating rather than slowing. Consensus estimates for the 2018 GDP growth are strong and recent job growth has been solid as well. All of which is good for commercial real estate and apartment demand. For investors prospects of rising interest rates have been the primary cause of concern in the commercial real estate industry as cap rates had compressed to record levels. However, the 10-year treasury reserved its trend after crossing 3% and some of the interest rate fears have eased. Record capital is being raised for real estate investment and that should support real estate values in the future as well. The investment sales market has been fairly steady over the past 2.5 years with investment sales volume peaking in '15, steady in '16 down a bit in '17 and so far in '18 as well. All four major sectors of commercial real estate have performed well in this economic cycle, occupancies exceeded the best readings of the last cycle and rent growth easily surpassed inflation. This year is turning to be a bit of an exception -- turning out to be a bit of exception. Net absorption a measure of tenant demand is slightly down year-over-year for all property types except multifamily. This is not surprising as industrials had a tremendous run up due to e-commerce growth. Retail is on a painful side of the e-commerce coin as more people [indiscernible] to their home with full employment, the office sector is starting to feel the slowdown of office job creation its inevitable resulting in slightly lower demand growth. On the supply side, the slowdown in completions has been similar across all property types deliveries this year running below last year's totals making the market fundamentals look as healthy as they were at the beginning of the year. Rent growth among the property types is diverse with industrial being the clear winner at just under 6% year-over-year growth, retail is lagging at 1.4% percent, the apartment sector is worth highlighting as after strong supply pipeline and weakening fundamentals, the market is recovering once again with rent growth accelerating up 40 basis points to 3% compared to the end of last year. So the highlights of second quarter include great sales growth, cost reductions, strong margin expansion, successful new product innovation, phenomenal marketplace traffic, strengthening customer relationships, outstanding competitive positioning across multiple products and all in all a solid economic outlook. I will now turn the call over for everyone's favorite part of the earnings call to our CFO Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. Great list of highlights, I don't think I can top that. Yes, we are making great progress against our operating objectives for 2018 and we continue to deliver strong financial results. We certainly remain confident about the trajectory of the business moving forward. As Andy mentioned, we delivered outstanding sales this quarter with $45 million in net bookings, which exceeded our expectations overall and we're up 23% from the second quarter of 2017. We are particularly encouraged by these results as there are a number of initiatives currently underway across our sales team. Our commercial real estate sales force continues to convert former LoopNet customers to higher value CoStar and LoopNet marketing contracts at a solid pace. Through the end of the second quarter, we've converted approximately 9300 LoopNet customers to CoStar and our marketing contracts at an average price of approximately $527 per month. On average these LoopNet users were paying only $54 per month for an average monthly price lift of $473 per month consistent with our results last quarter. At this point, we have generated $53 million in annual incremental contract revenue from the LoopNet conversion. In addition, we initiated our pricing and licensing compliance program in the second quarter resulting in higher prices per user on new contracts. We expect that this effort along with our focus on client service will result in improved sales and customer value over the long-term. Our focus on LoopNet as a marketing site is certainly paying off. LoopNet sales were particularly strong in the quarter as the commercial real estate field sales team increased their LoopNet advertising sales over 250% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Our field sales team is becoming increasingly effective selling power ads in the second quarter, selling 7x the level that they sold in the second quarter of 2017. Now granted this is from a small base, but the momentum is certainly encouraging. Finally, we had our best month of multifamily growth sales ever in June which is impressive considering our focus on integrating the ForRent and apartment sales forces in the second quarter. The anticipated cancellations of some legacy ForRent clients resulted in lower net bookings for multifamily in total, which we expect will be short lived as we complete customer integration and we continue reducing the ForRent property cancellations. Switching over to revenue, our growth rate was 25% in the second quarter of 2018 over the second quarter of 2017 coming in slightly above the high-end of our guidance range. As we indicated last quarter, we are now actively moving existing customers and selling new customers a combined multifamily network product that includes both the Apartments.com and the ForRent family of Web sites. Accordingly, we're no longer able to effectively calculate an organic growth rate for multifamily or for the company in total. Overall, our revenue growth in our two largest businesses CoStar Suite and multifamily is very strong and we expect consolidated revenue to grow in a range of 22% to 24% for the year a slight improvement over our guidance from the first quarter of 2018. Looking at our revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth was an outstanding 18% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017, a significant increase from the 13% annual growth rate we reported just a year ago in the second quarter of 2017. We expect CoStar Suite to continue delivering elevated growth levels with the growth rate for full year 2018 at or near the low-end of our 18% to 20% guidance range. Revenue growth rates and information services were negative 14% in the second quarter of 2018 as expected due to the shutdown of the LoopNet information services in the first quarter of this year. Excluding the LoopNet information services, our Real Estate Manager and other services in this group grew a whopping 57% in this quarter over the second quarter of 2017. Real Estate Manager continues to exceed our expectations with growth in excess of 100% in the second quarter of 2018 over the second quarter of 2017. With the shutdown of LoopNet bringing [indiscernible] substantially complete and the strong growth at Real Estate Manager, we expect information services revenue to decline at a rate of negative 12% to negative 15% on a year-over-year basis in 2018 a significant improvement from our last outlook. Multifamily revenue grew 54% in the second quarter of 2013 including the impact of the ForRent acquisition. The integration is progressing ahead of schedule but there's still a lot of work left to do. Accordingly, our revenue expectations remain unchanged and we expect multifamily revenue growth of 40% to 45% for the year. Rounding out our services performance, commercial property and land grew 16% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2018. Organic revenue growth normalizing for the May 2017 acquisition of LandWatch was 12% in the second quarter of 2018 versus the second quarter of 2017. With strong sales levels in both LoopNet and the Land marketplaces, we expect revenue growth rates to improve through the rest of 2018 and expect organic growth in commercial property and land in the 13% to 15% range for 2018. Our gross margins came in at 77% in the second quarter of 2018 in line with last quarter. Gross margins in the second half of 2018 are expected to remain in line with the second quarter improving slightly towards the latter part of the year following the closure of our Columbia, Maryland and Glasgow, Scotland research facilities. Our outlook includes some severance costs associated with these changes and modest savings in facilities and staff costs in the latter quarters. Operating expenses of $186 million for the second quarter of 2018 were below our estimates as we are laser focused on delivering our margin goals for the year. Approximately $3 million of our expense favorability in the quarter was associated with lower than expected personnel costs. Marketing expenses increased seasonally as expected in the second quarter although we pushed approximately $3 million of our marketing spend out of the second quarter and into the third quarter of 2018. The balance of the expense favorability related to focused cost management and operating efficiencies across the business including better than planned results in the ForRent integration. Our second quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA was $85 million or 29% of revenue. This was approximately $15 million above the top-end of our guidance range and a full 600 basis points above our projected margin. We're very pleased that we were able to maintain this high level of adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter when advertising and marketing costs reached their peak for the year. Net income for the second quarter of 2018 of $44 million increased an impressive 98% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Our effective tax rate in the quarter is 4% which includes income tax benefits of $6 million for state level research and development tax credits for the years 2013 through 2017. Along with $3 million of tax benefits associated with share based payment transactions. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2018 increased 114% to $60 million or $1.66 per diluted share and includes the adjustments for stock-based compensation and acquisition related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter assumes a tax rate of 25%, which does not include the tax benefits of share based payment transaction or the R&D tax credits we took this quarter. Now let's take a look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of the second quarter of 2018, our sales force totaled 775 people. The decline from the 905 sales people at the end of the first quarter relates primarily to the reductions associated with the ForRent integration. The renewal rate on annual contracts was 91% in the second quarter of 2018 up from 90.6% in the second quarter of 2017. The renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was an impressive 97%. Subscription revenue on annual contract accounts for 77% of our revenue in the quarter down slightly from 79% last quarter due to a full quarter impact ForRent, which has a lower percentage of revenue on annual contracts. As with most of our acquisitions, we expect this percentage to start increasing again as we convert more customers to annual Apartments.com full network contracts. Before I get to the outlook, I'd like to give you an update on the ForRent integration. Our efforts to convert ForRent customers to the new Apartments network product is on track and revenue retention is ahead of our expectations so far. Today, we have reduced approximately $20 million to $25 million in annual costs, which include staffing reductions of over 200 people and elimination of other duplicative operating costs. We've incurred $9 million of non-recurring integration costs in the second quarter and $12 million year-to-date, which are included in our results and added back in our non-GAAP financials. Overall, we're very happy with the pace and execution of the integration and expect to be substantially complete within one year of purchasing ForRent. I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the third quarter of 2018. Based on strong year-to-date revenue and sales results, we are raising our 2018 revenue outlook by $4 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. Our new 2018 revenue outlook is expected in the range of $1.18 billion to $1.192 billion. This revenue range implies an annual revenue growth rate of 22% to 24% compared to 2017. We expect revenue in the third quarter of 2018 in the range of $304 millions of $307 million representing top-line growth of around 23% at the midpoint. In terms of earnings, we are raising our guidance range for the full year of 2018 by $0.31 at the midpoint to a range of approximately $7.75 to $7.95 for a non-GAAP net income per diluted share and that's based on 36.5 million shares. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $395 million to $405 million for the full year of 2018, an increase of $15 million compared to our previous outlook. Year-over-year, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 40% to 45%. For the third quarter of 2018, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in a range of $2.02 to $2.10 and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $102 million to $106 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to increase in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter as marketing costs decline and we continue to progress with the ForRent integration. We expect to meet or exceed our goal of 40% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2018. Overall, I believe the strong results in the first half of 2018 position us to continue our revenue growth trajectory and margin expansion. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, I will now open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You've converted 9300 LoopNet customers through the end of 2Q. Can you elaborate on the cadence of LoopNet conversions in the second quarter relative to earlier quarters and how you expect future quarters to compare with 2Q with respect to conversion speed, conversion rate and the amount of pricing lift?
Andrew Florance: Well, pricing lift is remaining about the same as constant from Q1 to Q2 and expect the [indiscernible] of Q3 and Q4. We are building out some new marketing initiatives that we have been working on for a while that will be rolling out in Q3, Q4, which might provide some acceleration for the conversion pace. We also have been building software to enhance the -- in LoopNet product up sell experience. And so we expect to continue at a good clip. And as we said before, we think we will be converting at this sort of clip for a little bit better around this area for two years plus out from here. So -- and then even after we've converted a number of the folks who were formerly premium searchers are heavily searched for long rate time, LoopNet will remain a really important pipeline for up selling people to CoStar. So it's a great way to identify folks who need commercial real estate information and do a highly targeted marketing message to them. So it was a good performance and it will I think remain strong and steady for quite some time now. The one exception -- one thing that makes me think about though is, we're feeling really good about some of the product enhancements we've got coming on the marketing side of LoopNet. So we've been investing in making sure the sales force is comfort with [fluent in sound] [ph] and LoopNet marketing solutions across the whole CoStar Group. So there's been a little bit of shift to folks selling the LoopNet marketing solution and that necessitates a little bit less of a focus on doing the information conversions. But all in all we're very happy with the result.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Andrew Florance: Great. Thank you, Bret.
Brett Huff: On the bookings number of $45 million that's a focus some folks have had. Can you give us or I think it was Scott may have given us some kind of context around that vis-à-vis the -- there is still some LoopNet planned cancellations or shut down that negatively impacted that. Can you quantify that again for us? And number two, can you put a number or a ballpark on the pricing integrity negative impact on that $45 million. So I think that's a question we'll get a lot of. Thanks.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So Brett on the components last quarter, we took a large reduction in the LoopNet info I think we talked a lot about that. This quarter there's only about a $1 million of negative drag for LoopNet info. The other transition item in this quarter as we do for rent integration that we're seeing somewhere around $4 million or so of cancellations that come through as we work through the customer base and move the clients over to the network contract. So the pace and the revenue conversion ForRent is happening as expected. But as you expect there's this couple of quarters where you're going to see the cancellations to really solidify all the revenue there. So that pulls the number down just a little bit more. But I think as you look at what we've done really on the CoStar side and we talked about the LoopNet conversions, there are still strong. The CoStar field team is really put in some great effort now selling more of the LoopNet product in fact 25% of their output is now selling LoopNet marketing and it used to be 10% a year ago. So you see a little bit of shifting over to that commercial property and land which we talked a little bit about. And then, on the pricing side, the value increases there on the contract basis, I don't think we have a real slowdown in the quarter to talk through on pricing. I think it's more of the focus on the service initiative, the LoopNet cross sells, and then continuing the pace following the large discounting that that impacts the sales in the first quarter or the second quarter. So hopefully that gives you some context on the different pieces.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. And again, the ForRent cancellation number, we are outperforming that number. So when you put together two or three marketplaces, you expect to get very significant cost efficiencies, you expect to get -- you expect to have some loss of redundant advertising dollars which we're seeing, but we're actually getting a better than expected result on that. So we're really kind of happy with the way it's come out.
Andrew Florance: Yes. Our net sales for the quarter came out ahead of what we expected. Obviously that's what allows us to raise our revenue guidance, it's in a few different buckets and what it may have been in the first quarter, but our sales are always volatile quarter-to-quarter. We're happy that we're in this mid 40s range this year, we're in the mid 30s range most of last year and we're happy with the momentum we have going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey guys. Good afternoon.
Andrew Florance: Good afternoon, Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: Like the same day conference call, it's turning into a tradition I guess.
Andrew Florance: No extra charge for that.
Andrew Jeffrey: Much appreciated. With regard to cross-sell as you've seen this nice success with LoopNet. Any updates in terms of what you think the total cross-sell potential is. I know you've talked about Andy as much as a couple of hundred million dollars. Is that still a good long-term expectation, how can we think about that maybe nuanced or from a timing standpoint too?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So I absolutely still believe that number is a multi-hundred million dollar number. I consistently believe that to be the case. And as you know there will be two components sort of like that just looking at the number we have right now this quarter, relatively early on it's a pretty solid number for cross-selling. But you've got two really solid legs you're working here. One is the selling LoopNet to CoStar customers and the other is selling CoStar to LoopNet users or former customers. And they're both. I feel very optimistic about both. And it will naturally waiver up and down slightly, you will have some volatility from quarter-to-quarter, but it will be a real consistent message line for the next three years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Pete Christiansen from Citi. Please go ahead.
Pete Christiansen: Good afternoon guys. Nice trend. Andy can you rank some of the key reinvestment areas that you're looking on again sort of the next 12 months.
Andrew Florance: Yes. I mean just generally, one of the key areas is transformational product initiatives. We're going -- we're working on at Apartments.com. We look at the apartment industry not just -- it's not just a lead generation opportunity for the institutional great properties are over a hundred units. We think there's a really exciting opportunity for us and generally facilitating the leasing of apartments from the individual unit on up to the 400 unit property. I don't want to get too specific into some of the issues we're working on, but we are cranking on some product initiatives that we're pretty excited about and I think they'll probably -- they're going to require some investment and they are taking some investment now and there will be something that maturate over the course of 18 months or so. But when we are ready to bring this to market in the beginning of '18, we'll talk about them more explicitly. There are -- we continue to feel that there -- like ones or continue to feel there's an awful a lot of opportunity in the owner lenders segment of our industry. We've got some very exciting products we're working on to enhance CoStar to make it more useful for our many banking clients and try to win deeper penetration there. And we also believe that there is a significant global opportunity so we continue to invest into Spain and we'll be doing some investments into France where you know we already have a footprint. And the United Kingdom will probably begin cash flowing a little bit more, so they'll be priced for transfer investment into Germany. And so it's -- those are some of our bigger initiatives. Something I forgot Scott that we're thinking about.
Scott Wheeler: Certainly the LoopNet have marketplace.
Andrew Florance: So the LoopNet marketplace and you can see the numbers are really solid there. And you know that is becoming, I think that that has an opportunity, the LoopNet marketing commercials real estate on the internet, I believe is an opportunity on par with marketing apartments on the Internet. So we're going to invest behind that a little bit over the next two years. And then we might also do some additional investment into the businesses for sale areas at the tail end of that 12 month horizon. So we're exploring a number of different things there. Obviously, remaining sensitive to achieving our 40% margin goal and beating it the fourth quarter and then remaining somewhat consistent to that high margin level -- remaining consistent with high margin level ongoing and out year. So we're balancing reinvestment in the business would maintain the high margin levels. There is absolutely no shortage of potential investment initiatives just a question of prioritizing the really exciting ones upfront work and then in a -- in as fast a process as we can responsibly and efficiently run these initiatives.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mayank Tandon from the Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening. Scott, you touched on some of the pricing lift and obviously that has a lot to do with the LoopNet conversion. But could you just maybe parse out the growth rate that you expect going forward for '18, and then, maybe longer term as well as in terms of how it breaks down between increased penetration within the installed base adding new customers. And then, of course, any other pricing uplift beyond the conversion on LoopNet?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. So the -- the growth rates going forward we still expect to get about half of our growth from existing accounts and further penetration or broader geographies and we expect to get about half from new business and getting new logos. We're seeing that pretty consistently it doesn't change a whole lot. And the other area now that we're seeing more growth is really not only the pricing in the CoStar side, but as we've done more pricing on the LoopNet side for unlimited lister contracts and now on our listing plans we're seeing good upward movement in pricing on the LoopNet side as well. But what we haven't called in really into the rest of the years is that the pricing right now has been on new contracts coming in -- for new customers. We have not begun our program on a scale basis to do repricing an existing contracts as they roll. And we expect that will -- will start to work its way into the rest of the year and become a bigger impact into next year.
Andrew Florance: And that last point that Scott was making is huge. So on our existing customer base, we have not had in place rigorous processes to evaluate each contract renewing and making sure that it's appropriately priced at the point of renewal. So there is a lot of potential value in -- particularly in firms that might have signed up many years ago have merged and grown about a lot of people have grown their footprint and our enterprise licensing hasn't kept up with that. So one of Scott's primary initiatives is setting up the systems around that to make sure we're capturing that appropriate revenue uplift. And then also making sure that our commission schedules support that but that could be in -- that alone over the next three years could be $100 million in uplift, right pricing those. So we'll continue to see this higher -- this higher average price point hold I believe. And then, just the mix shift of going from marketing products to brokers in LoopNet to marketing products to owners I think has an enormous net price uplift impact. So it'll be pretty significant for the next three years.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Ridley Lane from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Ridley Lane: Good evening. In the past you have shown the number of advertising multifamily properties, now that ForRent has come online. I wonder if I could get updated on that metric. And then, directionally what portion of those properties are on a premium level package versus a basic package. How much have you found that base already? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Unfortunately the sheet that was printed on I removed from the conference room to go grab something, I took it from Rich half an hour ago, just before the meeting started. So we are at 42,147 on the Apartments.com before the ForRent came in. And the real impressive growth there is at the upper end with a 55% growth of our highest end ad, the diamond ad, and then, the silver ads only growing at 3% year-over-year. So the single highest growth category that people are buying is that that premium level ad. So that's good news. And the reason is, we're delivering a lot more leads and a lot more value and more value increase to the advertiser than the price is going up. And then overall it's 48,490 when you combine the ForRent apartments. Again, we will mark when we hit the 50,000 mark because that's like a hugely impressive feat of strength in the apartment marketing industry.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sheldon: Yes. Thanks. Good evening guys. How should we think about the factors that drove the adjusted EBITDA outperformance in the second quarter coming in at $85 million versus guidance, I think $66 million to $70 million? You talked about the $3 million push out of advertising expense, but how much of the outperformance was driven by ForRent. What other factors may have driven it. And did you adjust your profit assumptions for ForRent over the remainder of the year.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. You mentioned the marketing piece which was the part that shifts out the rest of the outperformance was all from a strong cost management and then a few million dollars of extra revenue that we that we had over our expectation. Yes, there's probably $2 million or $3 million of better than expected cost from the ForRent integration in the quarter. And so we expect that those benefits continue, we flowed the full $15 million of outperformance on EBITDA through to the guidance for the year. So we're confident that the things we're doing outside of the push in the marketing have to do with managing resources tightly as well as accelerating the ForRent integration and watching every other operating costs that we have, which we get a lot of duplicative marketing and other contracts that you find as you go through these integrations and those we were able to get out the door quicker than what we expected. So it's a solid performance managing headcount closely and taking out those duplicative cost gave you that outperformance.
Andrew Jeffrey: And Scott overlooks completely the single biggest factor which is we said 100% of all the senior executive teams bonuses for the year on feeding the 40% EBITDA margins -- adjusted EBITDA margin target for the fourth quarter. And I have reminded them at every single executive meeting that it's either make the target or not…
Scott Wheeler: That's true. You know that, every meeting.
Operator: Thank you. Our question will come from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone.
Andrew Florance: Hello Bill.
Bill Warmington: So, 100 hours of calls, I can say it only feels like half of that. And also before I forget it, just wanted to wish good luck to Rich on his less than a month left of bachelorhood.
Richard Simonelli: Thank you. Angela will appreciate your mention.
Bill Warmington: My question has to do with what -- one of those figures you threw out in terms of 41% more leads and higher quality better conversion rates. And so my question is, what are you doing to better demonstrate the higher quality to the potential buyers? And also then, what are you doing to better monetize those leads. And can you -- in some way use that $1 billion in cash that you're sitting on to somehow accelerate that process?
Andrew Florance: Bill I always appreciate your question. They are very helpful. Yes. So it's interesting the one of the ways at NAA, we partnered with two of the major players that provide lead tracking services for the apartment industry. One of them, LeaseHawk has sampled that 10 million incoming leads into apartment communities. That service shows that not only are we producing by far and away with the highest volume of leads, but they're also the most -- had the highest conversion rate dramatically higher conversion rates than any of the other lead sources, which is important to our customers because each lead is an opportunity for them, but it's also a significant cost item for them they have to process the lead and walk them to the apartment everything else. So we've been making it with these third parties that we're partnering with to communicate this information along with the tracking numbers we provide to our customers and the lead tracking tools we provide to them. They're very aware of the tremendous advantage we're providing them. And we've been hearing from them that they used to require two or three services to keep the lead flow they need. And that today they're getting 100% lead flow they need by just advertising with the Apartments.com network. So we're getting credit for it. I would say that in -- 30, 40 conversations I had with clients almost all of them told us straight out we measure it, we monitor it and absolutely without a doubt you guys get credit for the most leads and the highest quality lead. So that's a solid story we don't need to really -- I think we're effectively pushing it. However, you would expect that the clients get a great deal right now because while the lead flow and the conversion rate is going up dramatically, I was shocked at how big the lead number was this past quarter. It was huge. And it means that there is a pricing opportunity there and we're going to be -- we'll be looking at that and we will be -- we won't be out of control, but we do think there is an opportunity there for some pricing leverage there. So I think that we didn't expect such a tremendous growth in the lead flow as we've seen. So we're seeing this, it holds consistent. We'll probably look for ways to recognize some of that additional value -- we'll capture some additional value we're providing to those. In terms of how we use that modest cash balance. We have the -- we are very active looking at opportunities in the market. We have a number of different irons in the fire. We are being selective. We are not chasing things that we feel are overvalued in the cycle. And we're looking for reasonably priced assets that we think have -- we can get a 10 banger on, we can't get a 10 banger on it, why do it. But we're not -- we aren't forgetting that balance we're aggressively working it, but we want to do it the right way.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just one question on LoopNet conversions, of the 100,000 or so targets that you're going after, what percentage have you now kind of reached to do kind of the meetings and demos at this point to try to convert them?
Andrew Florance: I don't have an exact figure in front of me here, so I could only give you a guesstimate. And I would imagine it is 20% or so. But also remember that my experiences over the years has been that often that you'll have a quick sale cycle where you meet with one of those conversions and they close within 30 days. So your initial conversion rate -- initial close might be 50%. Your 3 year close rate might be 75%. So you have -- the first run of it and then those people often reconsider or eventually come around to it. So we have a motto here in our sales organization that eventually they all buy. It's just a question of when they see the light and they are ready to get a fantastic ROI for their investment in CoStar.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of Marc Wiesenberger from B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Marc Wiesenberger: Good afternoon. Thank you. Are you seeing any trend in non-traditional users across any of your platforms? And if so does that impact future product releases and/or marketing campaigns? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: We've always had a couple of big sea changes like one is the growth of owners, used we are predominantly driven by brokers now overwhelmingly our biggest customers are our owners and that's a growing segment. So that's a big focus for our product releases. We always have a remarkable collection of unexpected users of our products like, you can delve into it, and when you look at 20 brands and you're like why in the world are they buying the product, and then there'll be some explanation about the need to measure the radio transmission blockage of buildings in order to calculate certain things. So there's always something going on like LA school district subscribed to CoStar in order to forecast their budgets and out years since they're funded by commercial property taxes. So there is always something going on there. I actually think that it's not a small -- it's not a sort of wild outlier. But the banking industry I think is the next big phase for us. So our ability to wrap our customers' loan portfolios with good surveillance and strong underwriting tools I think we can for relatively modest cost, we can invest there and build some really compelling tools to the banking industry. So we have some things in development there. Also we're providing some tools for CMBS investors, I think are pretty exciting where we're giving CMBS investors advance information on the economics of properties in the portfolio as well before the servicers report that content to the investors. So again, some information arbitrage there, I think those tools have a lot of legs. So we're now -- we're really more focusing on bigger blocks of opportunities to taking folks who are traditionally 4% of our revenues and saying can we grow them to 10%. And there's probably five or six of those.

Andrew Florance: Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2018 earnings call. We have begun 2018 with a very strong first quarter, growing revenue 21% year-over-year. Net income grew 136% year-over-year to $52 million in the first quarter. We expanded margins for the [first quarter 2018] adjusted EBITDA margins at 31%, nearly 300 basis points above Q1 2018 level. We are on pace to generate almost as $400 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2018. We are confident that we will achieve our 40% adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2018. CoStar Suite revenue accelerated to a growth rate of 19% year-over-year as revenue reached $130 million of first quarter 2018. In the last 12 months, the number of individual subscribers for CoStar Suite in the United States alone grew by over 20,000 to approximately 126,000 as we continued to drive revenue growth across broker, owner, lender and institutional sectors. Multifamily revenue was $88 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 37% compared to the first quarter of '17. On an organic basis, multifamily revenue increased 23% in the first quarter of '18 year-over-year. Commercial property and land marketing revenue grew 19% in Q1 '18 year-over-year and has grown to an annual run rate of $160 million. This group generated highest ever bookings number as sales were strong for LoopNet, our land sites and business for sale. Bookings were up 29% Q1 '18 versus Q1 '17. We are very excited about the strong growth and high-margin potential of these businesses. Companywide bookings continue to be exceptionally strong in Q1 2018 as we achieved our highest ever sales quarter generating $54 million. Given the tremendous strength in our business, we made a decision to accelerate the LoopNet CoStar upsell conversion processes. A number of the legacy LoopNet information customers have told me they would buy CoStar when we wind down Premium Searcher, and some have even questioned me to why we've not already done the sale, so we did. We originally planned to discontinue LoopNet information revenue over the next 12 to 18 months. As we told you, instead we execute the wind down completely in the first quarter. This created a $19 million reduction in our first quarter bookings but also means we'll not be taken as cancellations in later quarters and we'll be on a much stronger sales position going forward. We did this because we believe it will help us drive more CoStar upsell revenue in 2018. We did this from a clear position of strength. The ongoing conversion of upsell LoopNet information users is clearly contributing to the growth of both CoStar subscribers and LoopNet marketing subscribers. Since our Phase II LoopNet conversion push began in October of 2017, we have converted approximately 7100 LoopNet customers to CoStar and/our marketing contracts at an average price of approximately $528 per month. On average, these LoopNet users were paying $54 per month for an average monthly price lift of $474 per month or $5688 annually. The 7100 includes 5200 conversions to CoStar at $555 per month and 1900 sales of LoopNet marketing subscriptions at $458 per month. At this point, we have generated $40 million in annual incremental contract revenue for the Phase II LoopNet conversion. Our initial Phase I push lasted about 18 months and generated in excess of $100 million of incremental revenue. Phase II is expected to last at least 18 months, and I believe it can generate significantly more than $100 million in revenue. There are approximately 88,000 discontinued LoopNet Premium Searchers or heavy LoopNet searchers, and we're still pursuing them all and are confident about our ability to do that. They remain a primary focus, and we are targeting a series of sales and marketing wave throughout the year to upsell them to CoStar. One way we're doing this is by carefully targeting high-potential broker prospects still using LoopNet for information with a special version of LoopNet that highlights the information advantages CoStar offers. When these targeted brokers search for listing in a given area, they see the listings marketed LoopNet on the map as red pens, and the many more CoStar abilities they cannot access because they're not CoStar subscribers as blue pens. When you look at the map it's a sea of blue pens with just a handful of red pens. When the conversion target clicks to see the details behind the blue, CoStar user only pin, they only see an upsell message. It's a very concrete illustration to the LoopNet heavy searchers just how much more value they can get with our professional version CoStar. It also has a powerful emotional effect or a fomo that drives people to action. The integration of the CoStar and LoopNet database has really been a tremendous success with an integrated easier-to-maintain database, our data products have never been better. We continue to proactively update 92% of every 1 million active listings every 30 days. As we mentioned previously, brokers now have the ability to update their own listings using a CoStar listing feature made available October 2017 and has seen widespread adoption. Of the 307,000 new commercial real estate listings added to our database since October, 136,000 or 44% were directly entered into listing manager. In that period, they were also 1 million listing updates and amazing 663,000 were added directly by users. In the month of March alone, users added just under 500,000 listings. At our typical research to listing ratio, they represent a shift of several hundred FTEs of researcher labor from us to our clients. We believe many of our clients prefer to add their listings themselves, so we're improving the product and potentially saving significant money. At this early phase, the new listing manager, our researchers are closely watching the listings users are editing. But once we're confident in the quality of this data, our research workload may drop significantly. We are dramatically expanding our commercial real estate news in coverage CoStar. We now have a team of 15 journalists breaking news stories and creating original content for our subscribers. We're looking to further expand to build upon our established reputation as a trusted and sizable news resource for commercial real estate. Our goal is simple: make CoStar the industry's most read and most respective source for commercial real estate news. CoStar contains a wealth of information, but the user has to work to search it out the product. With quality CoStar news, we proactively serve up our information to the user and engage them more deeply in the product. Not only does this make the product stickier by adding more value, it provides an even better platform for which we can support very valuable advertising revenue. We recently hired Dan Beyers, as Executive Editor and Vice President of CoStar News. Dan is an excellent business journalist and was a successful long-time news editor for The Washington Post. In a recent independent survey of 2000 commercial real estate professionals, 98% stated that they either rely on LoopNet or CoStar for commercial real estate information. We have invested heavily for decades to rebuild such a strong value number products such as 98% of market will use them. 2018 marked a turning point for CoStar and that moving forward we intend to be much more diligent in maintaining a strong and consistent pricing integrity. We license our services on an enterprise-wide regional site basis. We have tens of thousands of CoStar clients that are paying well below our list price. This has occurred for any number of reasons, but one of the most common is that a client grows and adds users but their CoStar pricing does not increase or reflect the new additional users. I believe these discounts could be an aggregate worth tens of millions of dollars to more than $100 million. I can give you just a few of these month's examples. Evaluation firm in New York City was licensed for 14 appraisers but actually had 23 using the product, so they agreed to an annual fee increase of $27,000. A banking client in San Diego took the negotiating position that only pay us $18,000 annually for 6 additional users. But when we walked from the deal, they agreed to pay $31,800 more annually. An asset management firm in Glendale, California, was a former client of Xceligent's, attempted to sign up for just 1 user but eventually agreed to the correct 5-person enterprise license, which is an increase of $14,510 annually. We are now rejecting more contracts from under-pricing and/or under licensing than we ever had before. We have, in fact, turned away large but under-priced contracts this quarter. No doubt this means we're forgoing some business. In intermediate longer term, however, we are confident that consistent pricing is fair to all our clients, will drive more revenue and drive better shareholder returns. Many of our CoStar sales people will have decline learning curve on pricing integrity, but I'm confident they will and the result will be much better. We invested significant legal fees and efforts over the past 2 years to bring Xceligent best of our product to a complete stop. We're now turning our attention to identifying the many people using CoStar without a valid license. We intend to find these freeloaders to strongly encourage them to purchase a valid license. We believe that there is as many as 10,000-plus people and perhaps 2 to 3 times that number illegally accessing CoStar. We are employing an increasing array of theft detection and prevention technologies. We are now contacting the first batch of 1000 firms we believe are stealing access to CoStar. We communicate the ethical problem with engaging in theft, give them an amnesty period to pay back fees and sign up. And if those efforts failed to correct the problem, we plan to seek monetary judgments. We're pretty good at that. We never want to litigate, but it is the reality of our business You may know that our case against Xceligent brought us to the jungles of the Philippines where a company called [Avion] was hired by Xceligent to steal our data. In our investigation, we discovered massive volumes of evidence that Avion was also linked to child pornography, prostitution, human trafficking and back page editorial sex website. We provide the evidence to the FBI and cooperated with half a dozen other law enforcement agencies. The site and its affiliated websites have been seized and shut down by a joint enforcement action by the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the IRS investigation division. A 93-count indictment was issued against 7 individuals for doing very bad things. In addition, following publicity surrounding our Philippines discovery Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provide a legal safe haven for the back pages amended to make it less likely that others will follow back pay pages footsteps in the future. Orders to serve mostly credit for finding this chapter of human and child sex trafficking, but we are glad we could help and make a difference. Moving back to LoopNet. We've clearly defined brands in the industry. We can now promote CoStar as the best information service for professionals and LoopNet as the best marketing service to attract end-users such as tenants and investors. We can also focus on making the LoopNet marketing experience even better, and we're working to give our advertisers even more value for their marketing spend. With the integration, we have eliminated free listings and are limiting most deeply discount legacy listing plans because. These free and nearly free listings were watering down the exposure value of our best clients adds. In total, we discontinued approximately 60,000 low-cost LoopNet adds or price of an average of about $6.09 per month. We are shifting our focus to selling high-value, high-impact larger top-sorting for owners with the highest needs of price points in the thousands of dollars a month. In the first quarter, clients advertise more than 5000 properties in these upper end power ad levels at an average prices ranging across tiers from $220 per month to $1054 per month. These power ads are basically the equivalent of the tier ad that we sell at apartments.com successfully. Historically, a particularly reported purchase LoopNet, LoopNet target marketing products to brokers with low-end properties. By doing so, LoopNet was effectively focusing on solving their $10,000 problems. In commercial real estate, there are plenty of $100 million marketing problems that need to be solved. We are repositioning LoopNet that's a better focus on solving these high-value needs for owners who have much more at stake and much larger budgets. We are demonstrated the owners that with the massive broker audiences we have in CoStar that read our newsletters, use CoStar and massive end-user audiences at LoopNet, we can help them migrate leasing risks and expensive multimillion dollar vacancy loss problems. It's an exciting project to reposition LoopNet as a higher value marketing site. We're giving top advertisers on LoopNet, bigger advertisements, higher placement and search result, videos exposures in the form of 3D virtual walk-throughs, villa montages, drone footage and much more. Historically, to sell lower-end commercial real estate advertising, we relied on e-commerce and inside sales team and a very ad sales team in the field. As we move up markets, more important to have field sales force to market the higher price points advertising opportunities just as we do so successfully with apartments.com. To accomplish this quickly, we have restructured the CoStar sales forces incentive plan to include a significant quota for LoopNet sales. CoStar sales force is well positioned to sell more LoopNet as they are already meeting with this target audience and these prospects have expressed a desire to have single points of contact. We expect that a significant change like this will initially slow sales productivity for a few months but you can see will yield greater results over the course of the next year. We believe that opportunity to have if we have an expanding LoopNet as a marketing site as a total addressable market in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Apartments.com continues to strengthen its lead as the #1 apartment Internet listing service. Our apartment’s network achieved all-time highs in visitors in traffic in the quarter. During the first quarter, the network averaged 40 million visits per month, up 40% and 15.6 million unique monthly visitors, an increase of 38% year-over-year as reported by comScore. The addition of ForRent strengthens our network. In the first quarter of 2018, ForRent averaged 3.7 million unique visitors and 6.4 million visits monthly. Our network produced 33% more leads in the first quarter of '18 than we did a year ago during the same period. And since we believe we have the best leads in the industry, this should make a listing on our Apartments.com even that much more valuable. In March 2018, we had nearly 90% more unique visitors in our network than the RentPath network according to comScore. And we increased that GAAP each month in the first quarter of '18. We continue to maintain an even bigger lead in total visits according to comScore. Our new 2010 advertising campaign with Jeff Goldblum is in full swing, and we believe it's our best campaign yet. We plan to run ads on primetime television, radio, streaming and outdoor, and we expect to reach 95% of all U.S. households with our new campaign. Even more positive is our exploding traffic trend being generated from organic search. We exceeded 75 million organic visits in the first quarter 2018, an increase of 71% year-over-year and a 50% sequential increase in Q1 '18 versus Q4 '17. We now have 72.5% share of top organic rankings for apartment rental keywords on Google, which is 12 times the [indiscernible] network and 18 times the RentPath network. In a striking and positive development, the number of landlords who have a small property or two are increasingly marketing these properties on Apartments.com. These landlords typically add under listings directly into Apartments.com, the number of these listing grew 96% year-over-year from Q1 '17. The most active markets included New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Miami. I think it's a really important and significant trend to watch. With the additional ForRent, we added close to 5400 non-duplicative apartment community customers to take us to nearly 47,000 advertised apartment communities on our network. We closed the ForRent acquisition about 60 days ago. And as we always do, we're moving quickly to integrate. We are already ahead of our original schedule and are running a playbook that we've incorporated previously with Apartments.com and Apartment Finder. We're moving full speed ahead in the tech integration of ForRent into Apartments.com network back end and anticipate the completion of this work, as well as some user experience improved as to complete, be complete by the end of the year. We have already realized significant cost synergies ahead of schedule. Since the acquisition of ForRent, we have eliminated 158 positions for the combined multifamily organization. 136 of those came from ForRent and 22 came from the legacy apartment’s team. This encompasses over $12.5 million in annual compensation across all departments in the company. We continue to uncover considerable additional cost savings with elimination of duplicative contracts and services. We look forward to reporting our continued progress in this area in the months ahead. We are working closely with the ForRent salesforce with just one goal of securing existing revenue. That's our first goal. Just after the close of the acquisition, we asked the ForRent salesforce to meet everyone of the unique customers 2 times as soon as they could and they delivered. The Net Promoter Scores for these visits were similar to the NPS for the Apartments.com sales team, from about 9.6 on a 10 points scale. Obviously, very positive feedback to the integration of the two companies. We believe this will lead to a significant decrease in cancellations as the ForRent customers see the benefits of having a great network that generates more quality leads. We have offered ForRent customers more exposure on the Apartments.com network at no additional costs at our silver level. This has resulted in a 70% increase in the quantity of leads these communities would have received had they remained only on the ForRent website. And while this increase in leads was provided to our customers with no additional costs, we believe there is an excellent chance that many of these customers will self-select a higher price add packages just like our existing clients have done. While we only have ForRent as part of Apartments.com network for a very short period of time, we have already made a couple of important changes in ForRent lead generation practices to bring us site in line with best practices. We are discontinuing ForRent's practice of buying leads from third-party publishers, did a practice of listing syndication. This change not only eliminates the generation of poor quality leads for our customers. It also protects the high-quality apartment listing data that can only be found on Apartments.com by discontinuing the share of the state with competitor sites. In addition, we have also made important changes to ForRent's onside lead conversion process. These changes eliminate any co-registration or shot-gunning to help ensure the lease produced for the Apartments.com network customers are only of the highest quality. Our ForRent sales people are now moving to a full production mode as we fully integrate them in the Apartments.com sales team. We now have over 300 highly seasoned and trained professionals selling the Apartments.com network across the United States, which we believe will result in higher sales and revenue as the year progresses and beyond. ForRent also brings us a strong social reputational management product. We believe it may have the potential to provide good value to our clients and high-margin revenue to us. We are evaluating rolling it out to our entire Apartments.com network. Recently, I think because of [Zales] recent announcement, I feel a number of questions so what or not we might prevent begin flipping commercial buildings to drive revenue. While to be clear, that even after successfully buying our Washington DC company headquarters for $41 million in 2010 and selling it a year later for $100 million of sale-leaseback, we're not going to become flippers. We recognize that flipping is completely different process from building marketplaces or Information Services. It's lower margin, its lower quality revenue and has horrific cyclically and balance sheet risk. Instead, we expect this balance sheet with strong financial position to make strategic acquisitions and make sound investments to develop a broad myriad of great high-margin growth opportunities we see ahead of us. A prolonged slower economic expansions to low cost of capital driven the U.S. commercial real estate market the very healthy levels with strong performance. The market is very competitive and in most segments, it is the landlords and sellers who have pricing power. In the office sector, vacancy is continued to hold a 10.3% for four consecutive quarters. This is a very healthy reading for the national office market and very similar to what we saw at the peak of the last cycle in 2006 and 2007. Construction is subdued compared to previous economic cycles to expect the national office market to remain healthy overall. The apartment market has entered a fifth year of a great cycle with strong demand and strong supply. While 2017 was a big year for completions, 2018 is shaping up to be at least as strong particular. That said, while current development activity may seem extreme, it's quite modest relative deliveries seen in the 1970s and '80s with the U.S. had 100 million fewer people. Most of the new space continues to absorb, the national vacancies are at 6.4%. The homeownership rate, which had created millions of households early in the cycle, seems to be reversing to create potential headwinds for the top end of the market especially the five star apartment communities. All of this, though, is good news for Apartments.com as market competition and turnover lead to more ad spending. Total investments sales has exceeded $340 billion in 2017. Those are slight decline from $364 billion peak in 2016. Fears of inflation and rising interest rates are expected to continue to create volatility in the stock market. Comparatively, the commercial real estate market is expected to offer sense of stability even if returns come down to levels seen in the last few years. So we've gotten off to an extremely good start in 2018. Strong revenue growth, margin expansion and the strong sales are indications that our investments and execution are strong. At this point, I will now turn the call over to our extremely confident CFO, Mr. Scott Wheeler of California.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Mr. extremely competent CFO, Andy of Washington DC.
Andrew Florance: The mutual admiration society.
Scott Wheeler: So, yes, we did had a strong start in 2018, and we're excited about the trajectory of the business certainly moving forward for the rest of the year. So as Andy mentioned, our revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 21% over the prior year, coming in any slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Organically, our revenue growth rate in the first quarter was 16% with all of our service areas performing at or above our forecast. ForRent contributed approximately $8 million of revenue in the first quarter. Our strong revenue performance is a result of our strategic investments primarily in two areas. First, the investments we've made in research in the CoStar LoopNet integration that positioned CoStar as a premier information solution for commercial real estate professionals. Second, it's our continued investment in and an expansion of our multifamily market places, which continues to deliver outstanding revenue growth. Looking at our revenue performance by services. CoStar Suite revenue growth was 19% in the first quarter of 2018, a significant increase from the 13% annual growth rate that we reported in the first quarter of 2017 and the 15% growth rate we reported in the fourth quarter of 2017. The conversion and upset of LoopNet information customers to CoStar Suite since October and sales to former Xceligent clients are significant driver of the accelerated growth. At the same time, the sales team continues to close new business with owners, financial institutions and other customer types. As previously discussed, the revenue growth rates for CoStar Suite is expected to be in the 18% to 20% range for 2018. Revenue growth rate and Information Services were negative 18% in the first quarter of 2018. As expected due to the shutdown of the LoopNet information products. The remaining services in this Information Services grouping grew 30% in the quarter driven by continued strong performance in our CoStar Real Estate Manager business over the first quarter of 2017. With the shutdown of LoopNet Premium Searchers substantially complete, we expect Information Services revenue to decline at a rate of the negative 15% to negative 20% on a year-over-year basis in 2018. Multifamily organic revenue growth for Q1 remains strong at 23% over the first quarter 2017 while one month of acquired ForRent revenue increased to total growth rate to 37% in the quarter. Going forward, our integrated multifamily sales force will only sell an integrated network product. Accordingly, we will longer be able to identify specific revenue as either organic or acquired. Going forward we will only report on multifamily revenue and the related growth in total. Regardless, our revenue expectation remains unchanged. With the addition of ForREnt, we expect multifamily revenue growth of 40% to 45% for the year. Rounding out our services performance, commercial property and land grew 19% year-over-year in the first quarter 2018, slightly above the 18% revenue growth we reported in the full year of 2017. Organic revenue growth normalizing for the May 27 acquisition of [indiscernible] was 12% in the first quarter of 2018. We continue to expect organic growth in commercial property and land in the 12% to 14% range in 2018. Our gross margins came in at 77% in the first quarter, in line with the fourth quarter of 2017. The reported gross margins are expected to be lower in the second and third quarters of 2018 due to the purchase intangible asset amortization that's associated with the acquisition of ForRent. When you exclude these non-cash dramatizations, gross margins are expected to remain in line with the first quarter of 2018 throughout the rest of the year. Operating expenses of $158 million for the first quarter were well below our expectations and reflect the heightened focus on cost efficiency and margin improvement as we progress through the year. Approximately $4 million of the expense favorability into our forecast was related to the late timing in some of our marketing spend within the year, while the balance related to resource savings and efficiencies across the business. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $84 million was approximately $12 million above the midpoint of our guidance range, resulting from the strong revenue results and the operating expense favorability I mentioned. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margins of 31% is 400 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance range and 300 basis points above the 28% margin we achieved in the first quarter last year. The impact of ForRent on adjusted EBITDA was approximately negative $3 million in the quarter as is expected. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 of $52 million increased 136% or $30 million compared to Q1 of 2017. Income from operations was up 42% year-over-year while interest income increased and interest expense decreased as a result of our strong cash position and the debt restructuring that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. To top it off, our effective tax rate was only 6% in the first quarter, reflecting benefits from the federal tax law changes and the incremental tax benefits on share-based payment transactions that happened in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter increased 75% to $60 million or $1.65 per diluted share and includes adjustments for stock-based compensation and acquisition related expenses. The non-GAAP net income assumes the tax rate of 25% which is not included the discrete items such as the impact of share-based payment transactions. Finally, in the first quarter, we completed our exciting implementation of the new revenue recognition standard know as ASC 606, which primarily affects our accounting for sales commissions. You will notice now that we have a nice bright shining new $75 million deferred commission cost asset in our balance sheet. In the first quarter of the year, our commission expense was approximately $4 million lower than it would have been under the previous accounting. We estimate for the full year 2018, our commission expense will be approximately $11 million to $13 million lower most of which was already included in our previous forecast. Now let's take a look at some of our performance metrics for the quarter. The end of the first quarter, our sales force totaled approximately 905 people, including the addition of the ForRent team. Following some staff reductions earlier this month related to the integration of the apartments sales force, the current total is about 855 people. We delivered $54 million in net bookings related to ongoing services in the first quarter of 2018. The negative net new bookings from eliminating the LoopNet Information Services results in companywide total net bookings of $35 million in the quarter. Adjusting for the onetime reduction in LoopNet Information Services in both comparative quarters, the net bookings have grown going services increased 48% in the first quarter of 2018 versus the first quarter of 2017. Sales and CoStar Suite in commercial property and land both showed strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. Renewal rates on annual contracts was 91.3% in the first quarter of 2018, up from 90.3% in the first quarter of 2017 and unchanged from the renewal rate achieved in the fourth quarter. Renewal rates for customers have been subscribers for 5 years or longer was an impressive 97%. Subscription revenue and annual contracts accounts for 79% of our revenue in the quarter, up slightly from 78% this time last year. I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the second quarter 2018. Based on strong first quarter revenue and sales results, we are raising our 2018 revenue outlook by $2 million in the midpoint from our previous guidance. Our new 2018 revenue outlook is expected in the range of $1.174 billion to $1.190 billion. This revenue range implies an annual growth rate of 22% to 23% total growth compared to 2017. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2018 in the range of $292 million to $295 million, representing top line growth of around 24% at the midpoint. In terms of earnings, we are raising our guidance range for the full year of 2018 by $0.43 at the midpoint to a range of approximately $7.44 to $7.64 for non-GAAP net income per diluted share based on 36.6 million shares. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $380 million to $390 million for the full year of 2018, an increase of $15 million compared to our previous outlook and a 120 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Year-over-year, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 35% to 40%. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $1.25 to $1.34 and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $66 million to $70 million. We expect the second quarter to be the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year as we increase our marketing spend for the start of the peak apartment rental season. Margins are expected to increase sequentially to the third and fourth quarters, and we expect to exit 2018 achieving our stated goal of 40% adjusted EBITDA margins. Overall, I believe the strong start to 2010 positions us to continue our revenue growth trajectory, and we plan to continue to manage cost and investments for margin expansion. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, we can know open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Your EBITDA came $12 million ahead of the midpoint guidance for the quarter and you're reading full year EBITDA by $15 million. You touched on the $4 million of delayed timing of marketing spend. Can you elaborate on the remaining sources of upside surprising the quarter? And what areas you feel more confident in for the rest of the year?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, George, thanks for the question. Yes, what we're seeing really is that refining good efficiencies across a number of our areas, all related primarily to the resourcing levels. So we don't need to add as many resources to get some of the productivity. You heard Andy mentioned the productivity we're seeing in research, and we also saw some good productivity across some of the different marketing programs we run. And the last area as I said we look at the synergies we're going to get out of the ForRent business and we are ahead of what we expected at this time regarding the headcount reductions that we just talked about, and so that's also helping us feel more confident about we're going with the cost for the rest of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Good evening. Thanks for the question. Nice trends guys. The sales force here - the CoStar sales force has got a lot of going on here. You obviously - pricing integrity initiative, moving in marketing, Xceligent transition, LoopNet conversions and then the normal day job. What's your expectation here for - how this could impact, I guess, organic activity? And what do you think the timing is until you could see some of these initiatives kind of taper off?
Andrew Florance: Okay. So and I left out another one, which was a focus on more face-to-face meetings with existing clients for a better service course. So you're right, there's a lot going on. And the reason there's a lot going on is because we have a lot of opportunity. So all these things are good things. And realistically, we're looking at where we are and the business has never been stronger. So we're thinking about things optimize the business longer term, intermediate term, and we are doing some important moves like watching the pricing, being more aggressive with the pricing, making sure we're driving both LoopNet sales and the CoStar sales of these clients. So I anticipate that over the course of the next three to four months, five months, that will create a little bit of churn. But that's a great sales force. They'll pick it up. They'll be a limited change added as it goes but we'll come out of it with an even more productive sales force. Even external productive but this will bring us what I think is optimizing our revenue opportunity. So looking out, it's probably in the fall, where you start to see a real traction pick up from it, maybe late summer.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Impressive performance on the Xceligent and across all efforts in the lift and resulting with pricing. Andy, can you maybe frame up what the tail on that is? In other words, I'm assuming some of those customers are smaller, maybe on average than existing suite customers. And as a consequent over time, they could grow via source against I guess same-store sales growth as it where. Is that sort of layering effect over time that you can think about?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So a lot of folks are going after. I mean, one of the things we really want to stress is that when we - that pool of 80,000 is still there. It's still an enormous, enormous opportunity and that five person, three -person, 10-person shot category, and that separate these things from the opportunity continue to sell the bank's owners and institutional players. So that broker segment is massive, and we are very confident that they haven't gone anywhere. We're in the process of either getting them to stop stealing and pay for it or just converting them and selling them up. As we do bring them on, you can see from the comments that we have two distinct really valuable products for these people. One is the information service CoStar and we're also getting additional seals on those LoopNet subscriptions for marketing and lead generation. These same brokers are the folks that can set up introductions for us to the owners they represent who tend to buy higher end ads, which I think has a lot of traction. So it is - it's really a gift that keeps on giving and it's a lot of opportunity for same-store sales going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me okay?
Andrew Florance: Yes.
Brett Huff: Great. Congrats on a nice quarter. Andy, I want to circle back to something you said. You kind of sized up the overall annualized revenue opportunity from the Loop upsell as well as the Xceligent, I guess, called opportunity now that they're largely gone. Can you remind us of what you think those numbers are, kind of conservative to more optimistic range, make sure that we're all kind of thinking about this over the next couple of years correctly? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So I would say that Xceligent is more largely gone. They're gone in the large way. But there's an intersection between the LoopNet and the Xceligent audience. So probably, 50%, 60%, maybe 70% is Xceligent customers were also using LoopNet. They start of fill gaps back and forth between them. And so there is a universe of 80,000 we look at, and that to me, I'm very comfortable that audience represents well over $100 million of incremental high-margin revenue. And we are taking our time to make sure that we price that correctly and that we're not rushing and that we're optimizing that opportunity. So it's - you can see the price points we've been achieving, just under 500 level, and again, the folks were coming in at typically $54, they're paying us $54 on average. They're coming in close to $500 net increase, so it's a huge, huge opportunity.
Operator: We'll go to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good afternoon, everyone.
Andrew Florance: Hi, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So a question for you on the growth in net bookings number. You talked about $54 million growth bookings less the $19 million in cancellations, giving you $35 million net. So my question is, how much of the $54 million was from Premium Searcher users converting to the Suite users? And I'm trying to get a sense for what the normal cancellation level is going to be like going forward and what the normal conversion level is going to be like going forward.
Scott Wheeler: So most of that -- I would say that the impact of the 1.9 million cancellation is going to - I think most of that is future opportunity. So as you - I would say that occurred what, in what month exactly as Scott? Was it February?
Scott Wheeler: In January…
Andrew Florance: And they really got noticed in March.
Scott Wheeler: Now, February is when we got them all shut off you're referring to.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So it's really - we didn't see any much impact to the positive from that shut down. We expect that to happen over the next 9 months or so. And I guess it would be about, what, 1,000 to 2,000 loops in up-sells in the current …
Scott Wheeler: Yes.
Andrew Florance: But probably half of that was unrelated.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, and we didn't see shutdowns coming in the quarter so much. Those coming following quarters really from the things we've notified previously in the Xceligent from the last quarter.
Andrew Florance: So it's more geared towards Xceligent side.
Scott Wheeler: Yes.
Andrew Florance: And other opportunities, which probably majority driving it. Does that answer the question?
Operator: One moment please.
Bill Warmington: Yes, thank you very much. And I have this, normally do this on Thursday, I wanted to say have a good weekend but then I realize it's only Monday night.
Andrew Florance: Yes, someone sign me up on a keynote speech on Thursday at 11 so sure to get jammed up this week, so we're doing it Honolulu time this week.
Bill Warmington: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go to David Ridley Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David Ridley Lane: Sure. So some Apartments.com competitors are offering new different pricing models such as cost for lease type of pricing. Curious if that's something you'd be willing to explore. And if I could sneak in another, with the increase in organic search Apartments.com, how does that play into your longer-term or medium-term thoughts on advertising costs on the apartment side? Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Okay. So, yes, there are number of people who are working cost per lease models. Generally, those are folks who have a weaker value proposition to the apartment communities. So if you're the clear leader in this space, people look at you as the primary source of filling up their property. They're willing to have a fixed subscription amount with this. And that is the preferential - that's a better situation to be in. If my traffic or my lead flow is lower, then I say, hey, guys, look, if I can't deliver anything, if I can't deliver anything to you, you don't have to pay anything. So you just pay me if I can show you get a lease. So it's something that we might consider as a low-end but not at the institutional end. At the institutional we're driving a consistent steady flow, the primary flow of leads some of these big communities that would only make sense for us at the mom-and-pop level. And I've spoken to some of the folks you're talking about whether are doing that cost per lease models and they're pretty frank about saying we wish we could do subscription pricing but we're not as strong as you are so we had to do cost per lease. The organic traffic is obviously mind-boggling. The keyword share we have now, the organic keyword share is mind-boggling and really strong. So congratulations to Fred Saenz and his team for producing that. I don't think that changes much on the advertising spend. That's one of the reasons why we do so well there is we have a good duration, a little people up to click on it, so when it served up, it's often a successful serve up which then reinforces our organic ranking. So I think the two work off of each other, and it's a good thing. With growing margins, we're going to keep working to see more of it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon with Needham end Company. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening. Maybe for Scott. Scott, in terms of long-term margins, if you could just give some thoughts around how you're thinking about it directionally, especially given that we'll see these synergies from ForRent, the high-income incremental margins from the LoopNet upsell and, of course, the inerrant leverage in the business of the business. So what other puts and takes we should be considering as we model up the long-term margins for CoStar?
Scott Wheeler: So clearly, we're focused on getting through this year with the margins getting up to the 40% by the end of the year. And as you've seen, it's a combination of strong operating leverage as we drive revenue, and the operating leverage requires that we make significant investments in future growth of the business often to the P&L that come ahead of obviously when the growth comes up. So as we're thinking further out, we're looking at one of those investments we need to keep making. Like the research investment, like the apartments investments I mentioned. Those are driving significant revenue growth, although they're a year or two sometimes lagging when we make the investment. So as we start to plan for 2019, we're going to look at all those opportunities for investments and will they drive revenue growth. And then once we get that spent together, we will start to talk about where we see the margins going further. What we're doing at this time is putting out another big margin target like we did with the 40%. We're going to evaluate where we are as we got further in the year and then give you some further guidance as we get later in the year.
Andrew Florance: And we only have two margin - big margin goals simultaneously running. We'd rather achieve 1, get the trophy and then set another goal.
Scott Wheeler: More to come.
Operator: And our next question from Mike Crawford with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
Mike Crawford: Thanks. Furthering your earlier comments regarding greater research productivity, is there anything you're investing in from a technology or analytics standpoint that we should look out for?
Andrew Florance: Sure. I mean, I would say that it's next to impossible to beat the performance of listing managers so far. So I think that was a big - that was a decent sized technology effort. We put a lot of effort into the UX to make sure that it was a seamless experience. It was intuitive. We'll continue to do that, and that technology investment has led to something that could save us well north of $10 million a year ongoing, may be even more than that. And at the same time has increased the quantity of data and client satisfaction. We're doing - we do have a slightly different structure now. We have a dedicated software team down in Richmond for supporting our research operations. We're doing across the whole system. We're seeing some really interesting potential in research product that comes out of technologies, so things like we're starting to learn more about what customers want from their search behavior and that actually becomes data in and of itself. So for instance, if you're conventional list says that [people 16 over] want two bedrooms. Well, Apartments.com now showing us that's free, that's actually people want one bedroom based on the subjectivity we're seeing. We're doing more robots to scrape websites and serve up content there and observe content. So we have, any given point a dozen to two dozen initiatives in technologies for our research operations. But the silent - the emerging big decade-old winner is listing manager and impact on our bottom line that is going to have is really, really hard to beat in the same quarter.
Operator: And our next question from the line of the Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Hi, guys. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. A question from our side. It sounds like the opportunity to go after some of these is pretty large but can you size maybe the annual spend that's going to be required to get some of these guys to start paying you?
Andrew Florance: I think we've found - you're right. The prior audience is pretty big. And the fact that we were spending so much time and effort with Xceligent probably diverted our attention away from these folks a bit. We did invest about a year ago in building our technology, our own facial recognition, pattern scanning, device recognition. We did invest a lot about a year ago in technology tools that are available now, which will support this effort. Typically, when you approach someone with really compelling clear evidence that we know they have been receiving the product, nine out of 10 or 19 out of 20 just want to, like you caught me, I'll pay up. And so you're typically only litigating one in 20, which would still be a lot. But I think that if you just show people who read that they just can't get away with this, I think you can move your ratio up to 49 out of 50 will work something out with you. So it had to be able to share that you're willing to litigate the lots support your side, which it clearly does. Someone that is using CoStar illegally and producing reports and printing out photos, subjecting themselves to potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars of damages under the law. So we think it'll cost a little bit but nothing like we spent last year in Xceligent.
Operator: And our next question from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just at the midpoint for the second quarter it looks like the guidance only calls for about 30 basis points of margin expansion on an adjusted EBITDA basis. I think you talked about increasing marketing spend and multifamily. So I guess just any color on the planned incremental spent on that, and is there anything else to point out that will impact margin expansion in the second quarter?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Two big things for second quarters, like you pointed out, the marketing spend. So we do have the most significant second quarter marketing spend that we've - we'll ever had in the second quarter, so that definitely does cause and effect. And then the second is we've got the first full quarter of the ForRent cost coming into the second quarter. So that's going to dilute a little bit more in the second quarter and is going to show these cost moving sequentially. Obviously, as we continue to do our integrations and those will moderate over time, but those are the primary drivers in the second quarter for us.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll go to Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Walravens: Okay, congratulations. So I feel lucky that I get to ask the strategic acquisitions question towards the end year…
Andrew Florance: Acquisitions we're not really…
Patrick Walravens: You talked about the whole $50 billion real estate opportunity. What - can you share with us in terms of your sense for timing? And is the market receptive? And sort them which area you see most interesting?
Andrew Florance: Well, we are actively looking at and considering a whole range of opportunities, and it is a broad and significant range of opportunities for sure. There are some things we're a little more excited about than others right now, and I think it's a combination of what is the most strategic and important initiative we could engage in about resources too as a company coupled with at what price can we acquire those assets. So we are looking to - right now, I could roll-off 12 companies that I think will be a great acquisitions for CoStar, but they are great acquisitions for CoStar at the right price on the right terms. So we are patient investors, and we will continue to churn away at finding that next opportunity, but we're not going to be just jumping because we have cash on hand and balance sheet on hand. And we also for another two to three months want to not take ForRent for granted as the largest acquisition we've ever done by revenue and one of the largest ever that we've done by staff. So we want to make sure we do that right. Has there been anything larger by staff?
Scott Wheeler: None.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So when you got a big 1, you should never eat anything larger than your head. As I want to make sure we get this 1 done properly. But we're busy. We are busy. We have not changed our stripes. We just haven't pounced yet.
Andrew Florance: So thank you very much. I think those are a great group of questions, and thank you for being flexible as we approach our 20th anniversary as a public company for the first time, we changed to a Monday evening. We will try in the future to not let people schedule speeches for me on the same time as the earnings call. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Richard Simonelli. Please go ahead.
Richard Simonelli: Thank you operator, appreciated. Welcome to CoStar Group’s Fourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Before I turn call over to Andy Florance, CoStar’s CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I have some very important items for you to consider. Certain portions of our call today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ, include but are not limited to, those stated in our February 21, 2018, press release, on fourth quarter and year end results and at CoStar’s filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar at the time of this call, CoStar does not assume any obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to all of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including but not limited to, non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are shown in detail on our press release issued yesterday, along with definitions which have been updated for those terms. Press release is available on our website located at costargroup.com. As a reminder, today’s conference call is also being broadcast live and in color on our website where you can also find CoStar’s Investor Relations page. Please refer to yesterday’s press release on how to access the replay will be about an hour after the call. Remember, one question, make it a good one. I’ll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy?
Andy Florance: Thank you, Richard. Appreciate that, that was an excellent preamble. Thank you for joining us today on our year-end 2017 earnings call. Four years ago, on a similar earnings call in which we reported $476 million revenue run rate, we’ve set a goal of reaching $1 billion in annualized revenue by the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. I’m very pleased to announce that with the fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $254 million, we have met our $1 billion in revenue run rate goal in entire year ahead of target. And I’m even more pleased that we crossed the $1 billion milestone with a stronger sales momentum I have ever seen in this business. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated $43 million in net new bookings, a sales increase of 47% year-over-year. For the year, we add $127 million in revenue and achieved our best sales year ever with $148 million in net new bookings, up 32% over 2016. Leading the strong momentum, CoStar Suite net new bookings increased 100% in Q4 2017 versus the same period in 2016, not that the same period in 2016 was weak. Quite literally, sales of our flagship service were off the chart in the fourth quarter. We added more new companies than ever before, with 3,100 net new North American clients added at our CoStar subscriber base, which is nearly triple the number the same quarter a year ago. We added 5,863 new users to CoStar in the fourth quarter of 2017. For all of CoStar, December was our best sales month ever by a wide margin and January was our second best ever by a wide margin. As a company, we sold more in December 2017 and January 2018 than we did in the entire year of 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Apartments.com had its best net new sales bookings quarter ever. Apartments.com sales were up 36% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This was particularly strong performance since historically, the fourth quarter for Apartments.com and all the ILS companies is normally a seasonally weaker quarter. For the full year of 2017, CoStar revenue growth was 15% year-over-year compared to 2016. Four years ago when we set that $1 billion revenue run rate goal, we also set a goal of reaching a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 2018. We’ve made -- we are making good progress towards our EBITDA margin goal and remain focused on achieving those very strong margins by the fourth quarter 2018 as we stated. Net income for the full year 2017 grew 44% year-over-year and EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year. Our unprecedented sales successes in the fourth quarter 2017 drove unprecedented commission paths for our sales force in the fourth quarter, that’s a good thing. The ROI on these sales are fantastic and clear. This continued into 2018 with high commission expenses in January. This suppressed our EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter, but in the intermediate term, this exceptional revenue growth is expected to enhance margins. We are in the middle of a seismic shift in U.S. commercial real estate information, analytics and marketing landscape. In the middle of December 2017, our major competitor, Xceligent, suddenly and unexpectedly filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation. Xceligent had been in business since 1999 and was operating in over 40 major U.S. cities. We believe that Xceligent had well over 5,000 commercial real estate customers. We believe that various investors over the years had poured over $200 million into Xceligent. When we acquired LoopNet, we agreed to divest LoopNet’s partial interest in Xceligent as part of an FTC consent decree to replace any loss competition in the merger. At the time of Xceligent’s bankruptcy, we were engaged in a major lawsuit with them. A former employee of Xceligent’s had tipped us off that Xceligent was stealing and reselling our data on an industrial scale. We investigated and found that, that was true that Xceligent had created thousands of fake passwords that have accessed our servers millions of times, in fact even 10 million times, to copy content from us. We found tens of thousands of our copyright photos shot by our employees that were copied and resold on Xceligent site. We had statements from many Xceligent employees that the theft was a widespread practice to Xceligent supported by senior executives directing their employees and contractors to steal CoStar data and photos and use them to build themselves Xceligent’s products illegally. We believe we had a clear, great case. If lawsuit contributed to Xceligent’s death, the real underlying cause of death was Xceligent’s massive and sustained financial losses. We believe that Xceligent failed to make any profit for years. In fact, we believe over the course of two decades, Xceligent never made a profit or even approach breakeven. We do not have exact numbers, but we believe that by the end of 2017, they were spending roughly $5 million a month -- they’re losing about $5 million against approximately $2 million or so of monthly revenue. So $2 of loss per $1 of revenue roughly. Immediately after Xceligent’s bankruptcy, the recently fired CEO of Xceligent launched a brand-new company called Intrepid, that claimed to have roughly the same data coverage and software that Xceligent had the prior weeks when it closed its door. The bankruptcy trustee appointed an Xceligent Chapter 7 filing shut the start up down relatively quickly. With Xceligent’s failure, somewhere around 5,000 companies suddenly found themselves without a commercial estate information system. This left us with an unprecedented opportunity to act quickly to pick up tens of millions of dollars of orphaned business, an important moment. We pulled out all the staffs to respond at the maximum level of effort. I personally worked around-the-clock on one weekend December loading up every credit card I had in order to send holiday gift baskets to almost every former Xceligent customer. I literally was debating with folks at customer service centers in India at 4:00 a.m. telling them I was good for an increase my credit line. In the weeks that followed, we hand-delivered thousands of gift baskets, getting our salespeople to the doors of thousands of these people immediately was a good investment. On short notice in January, we then launched a 33-city roadshow to market where Xceligent had a presence. We hit the road with all of our senior executives, personally visiting 1,500 of Xceligent’s former clients to let them know all about the valuable CoStar service we had to offer them. We went to markets big and small all the important from Houston, Atlanta, Miami, Minneapolis, Little Rock, Northwest Arkansas, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Columbus, you name it. Our objective was to meet as many former Xceligent users as possible, to educate them on the depth and breadth of our service offering. More importantly, we want to demonstrate the substantial investment we had made and we’re making to cover local markets with real quality and why having great data and technology costs what it does for a subscription. Our service cost more than Xceligent’s did and it’s well worth it and it’s sustainable. All told, about 1,000 CoStar staff were involved in these meetings in person or via video conference, with hundreds of flights, I believe January 2018 was likely our highest travel expense month ever. In order to get 1,500 companies into rooms on one week’s notice, we give Apple iWatches to highlight our very cool upcoming CoStar for Apple iWatch product. Remember that the potential net present value of signing up each one of these clients typically can be $50,000 and much, much larger. So giving them an Apple iWatch to get them into the door for sales pitch, where you have about a 30% to potentially 60% close rate, is a no-brainer. The effort has already resulted in our signing over – up to about 1,000 former Xceligent clients, 1,000 former Xceligent client firms. In addition, this already have a dramatic effect on further improving our data as these clients are regularly contributing updates and sharing information with our research team much more proactively than they had been. It’s my believe that more of these clients we sign up now, the more we will eventually sign up. I believe this Xceligent development represents a $50 million plus annual revenue opportunity for us. Many of the former Xceligent customers have yet to sign for CoStar were relying on LoopNet or LoopNet Premium Searcher as a low-cost alternative to CoStar. So updating you on LoopNet. It was another driver behind our fourth quarter sales achievement and the successful integration of CoStar LoopNet database has made that possible. Prior to the fourth quarter 2017, LoopNet.com and CoStar.com were each supported by their own separate databases. They were linked in the information flowed back and forth between these databases, somewhat imperfectly. But by definition, it could be improved. The separate databases drove higher cost for both CoStar and our clients while degrading data quality. CoStar’s service is our highest quality professional information tool used by more than 100,000 industry professionals. LoopNet as a marketing platform with unmatched audience of approximately five million monthly end-users shopping for commercial real estate each month -- or a month. Both services are well-regarded for their respective brand strengths. There is brand confusion however, significant brand confusion because LoopNet also had three legacy information products that were, frankly, inadequate for professionals. And they were Premium Searcher Property Comps and Property Facts, low-cost information solutions that were not proactively research like CoStar is. So the information they presented were notoriously incomplete and inaccurate. Premium Searcher was the largest LoopNet information product and allowed users that pay to monthly fee to see both the advertised listings on LoopNet as well as the ones that brokers had listed for free. This means that a Premium Searcher could see 20% to 40% more listings on LoopNet than a free LoopNet user could see. As long as LoopNet remain both great marketing platform and an in adequate information solution, there were too much brand confusion, which prevented us from optimizing the marketing solution potential of LoopNet or the information solution potential of CoStar. With the pre-integrated LoopNet and CoStar, half the commercial real estate world update LoopNet and the other half updated CoStar making neither one the clear and simple go to solution. That increased research costs integrated quality. Several years ago a number of LoopNet unlimited listing plans were sold, which allowed brokerage firms to market huge numbers of listings on LoopNet for as little as a few dollars of listing, which is just in adequate. These plans are misused and cannibalized both LoopNet and CoStar revenue. As part of the integration, we’ve been discontinuing these unlimited listing plans in addition to Premium Searcher itself. And there’s a little bit of a headwind created to our sales as we wind down those unlimited plans. We notified the client base in the early fall 2017 of our intentions to discontinue these products. Almost immediately, a large volume of the LoopNet Premium Searchers began migrating to CoStar. As these users began voluntarily migrating from LoopNet to CoStar, we lost the revenue they were paying LoopNet for information, but typically, gained four times that revenue for CoStar subscription. Just a few weeks ago, we notified Premium Searchers that their service will be discontinued this month. There are a small number that will be discontinued throughout the year, but overwhelming majority are discontinued as of this month. As we discontinue Premium Searcher in February 2018, we expect to lose approximately $1.8 million in monthly revenue immediately, but expect to more than make up the lost revenue within the year as we convert many of these clients to much more powerful and profitable CoStar information solutions. We expect to see a sales headwind in February 2018. But with offsetting gains through both 2018 and 2019, this clearly suppresses margin expansion in the first two quarters of the year, but drives really valuable, potential intermediate and long-term EBITDA expansion. There is never an easy time to intentionally eliminate $22 million of annual revenue. But the current timing seems the best I believe, and I believe will help us sell more CoStar information and more LoopNet marketing. With LoopNet Premium Searcher and Xceligent gone, I believe there is more market clarity as clients migrate to CoStar. Through the end of January 2018, we converted over 5,400 LoopNet Premium Searchers or heavy searchers to annual CoStar subscription users at nearly $520 net new per month. Many of these LoopNet users up sold to CoStar were playing zero before, and those paying were paying about $145 per month on average. So the blended average LoopNet price was $49 prior. That successful conversion drove the massive surge in CoStar sales in the fourth quarter 2017. We’re not done with that. We have really just begun this conversion process. There are approximately 80,000 more discontinued LoopNet Premium Searchers or heavy LoopNet searchers who now have dramatically less access to free content, and we’re focused on upsigning them to CoStar this year. This is a great investment for these prospects to make in CoStar, and it’s the most important revenue opportunity I believe we’ve ever had. It is our number one priority. We believe that we will continue having success upselling LoopNet accounts. The amount of information of broker gains by upgraded from LoopNet to CoStar is impressive and clear. In a market like Phoenix, in the past, a broker may have had previously using LoopNet, a broker may have access to about 75% plus of available listings on Premium Searcher. Now that broker can only see 45% of those listings. In addition, only CoStar for Phoenix provides details on tens of thousands of tenant sales comps, lease comps, market analytics, industry news forecast and a lot more. We feel it’s also compelling investment many will make. We also believe that they will renew at a very high rate, that’s been our experience. So such a major shift in the competitive landscape, we commissioned a third-party research firm to conduct extensive market research and focus groups during this past December, January and February. We want to understand better real time how commercial real estate firms were reacting to events so we could better tune our sales and marketing messages. One preliminary result you might find interesting is the response more than 1,000 CRE professional survey had the following question. A CRE information services is, which one do you tune to turn to first? 56% said CoStar, 31% said LoopNet, 3% said Catalist, 1% said LoopNet, 1% said Real Capital Analytics, 1% Pierce-Eislen, 1% AIRR, less than 1% Reis, less than 1% CompStak, less than 1% Axiometrics, less than 1% Proptylink, and 4% said other. So that 80 said that is 87% CoStar Group and 3% for the next closest player. There was one next closest player. There was one moment humor in one of the focus group when the moderator said, with Xceligent, what’s the greatest weakness? And there was a long pause. And then one of the participants offered up they’re bankrupt. In addition to operating an information service at Xceligent.com, Xceligent operator marketing website that competed with LoopNet called Commercial Search. When Commercial search was up and running, LoopNet captured 23 times more traffic. Now LoopNet captures more than 40 times more traffic than the second closest CRE marketplace competitor. These developments are possibly the best news for CoStar Group in a decade. Not sure what the better news was in the prior decade, but we’ll just leave it there. As we move to capture all the potential value now open to us, we have made significant investments in discontinued significant revenue faster that planned earlier, thereby driving down margins in the first half of the year. I believe trading a few hundred basis points of margin for several quarters in order to jump on a potentially once-in-a-lifetime significant long-term revenue and competitive gains is an obvious choice. This is a business, not a spreadsheet. Even so, we’re not moving away from our 40% adjusted EBITDA margin goal for the fourth quarter 2018. We are more confident than ever of our ability to reach the goal because of all these recent market developments. One of the key factors that made all of these sales possible was our investment in our Richmond global research center. In little over a year, we elevated the industry’s best database and analytics offering to new heights of excellence. We are now proactively updating 92% of our over 1 million active listings every 30 days in person over the phone while vastly improving our tenant data with our new nearly hired 250 tenant researchers. With the addition of CoStar Listing Manager featured in October 2017, our clients and users are adding hundreds of thousands of updates directly themselves each month in realtime. In the first four months, they’ve averaged over 700,000 updates to listings per month. That’s a lot of work now being done directly by the folks listing the properties that used to be done by our researchers. Our investment in people and technology made this possible and our data products have never been better as a result. With an integrated and easier to maintain database, the new ability for brokers update their own listings and greater industry cooperation, we believe and expect that research cost will begin trending back down within the year. As you know, we recently were pleasantly surprised by the timing and receiving approval from the FTC to move ahead and closed the ForRent acquisition. We closed the acquisition yesterday morning and there was a little bit of use of our capital there. This is the largest acquisition we’ve done to date, measured by revenue and the number of employees in the acquired firm. I met with our new colleagues in Norfolk, Virginia yesterday to welcome them to CoStar and to thank them for joining forces to strengthen the number one multi-family marketplace network in the United States. And I see a number of our colleagues are on the earnings call today. Welcome, everybody, again. ForRent has 16,000 advertised properties on its network of multi-family sites. In addition to the primary site ForRent.com, they also offered a targeted sites, AFTER55.com, CorporateHousing.com, and ForRentUniversity.com. Similar to ApartmentFinder, we plan to run ForRent separate website with its own distinct and different websites experience and user interface. I believe as we have demonstrated, it is valuable to have multiple leverage consumer brands in the apartment rentals website space. With the acquisition of ForRent.com, our multi-family sales force increases by nearly 15%. I’m expecting an incredible year for this bigger team in 2018. Just like ApartmentFinder, we’re not planning to do a specific branding campaign or TV campaign ForRent as we did with Jeff Goldblum for Apartments.com. We’re focusing all of our efforts on Apartments.com. We’ve planned to focus on online marketing for ForRent. However, and there’s no doubt that advertising and brand work for Apartments.com will benefit ForRent because it gives our salespeople better access to buyers because of the power of the unprecedented Apartments.com marketing reach. We intend to move with all possible speed to connect and drive ForRent from the same content-rich back end that powers Apartments.com and CoStar. Also we are moving as quickly as we can to give ForRent customers additional exposure on existing Apartments.com network. We believe that this will reduce customer churn at ForRent.com pretty quickly. The timing of the closing will reduce margin over the next two or three quarters, but we expect to expand margins significantly in the quarters beyond. Apartments.com continues to grow in strength in less than three years, we’ve transformed the industry. We’re extremely proud of what we’ve done since they’re on the market side of the multi-family business in 2014 when we purchased Apartments.com. The 2015 acquisition of Apartment Finder and WestsideRentals.com in 2017 were awesome, and we’re looking forward for ForRent’s contribution beginning today. A lot of companies, it’s a mouthful. Multi-family marketplace revenue has grown $280 million in 2017 up from $86 million in 2014. With revenue of $76 million in the fourth quarter 2017, we finished the year with an annualized revenue run rate of $304 million, I believe that is by a wide margin the largest revenue run rate of anyone in the space. Adding ForRent’s pro forma revenue to that, in 2018 our multi-family market revenue approaches $400 million, and we expect to exit 2018 with over $440 million of revenue run rate for our multi-family marketplace business. It’s a lot of progress from the $86 million. The business is solidly profitable, and we expect we will continue to expand margins as we add revenue. In 2017, we had the most traffic of any apartment listing website. In the fourth quarter 2017, according to comScore, our network attracted over 44 million unique monthly visitors in the aggregate for, an increase of 44% year-over-year. While our closest competitor, RentPath, had 21 million unique visitors in aggregate, which represent a 7% increase year-over-year. In January of this year, with the new ForRent enhanced Apartments.com network, we would have almost three times the number of visit that RentPath had. For the 27th consecutive month, Apartments.com was the most visited apartment listing network. We had more than 468 million visits for the year, up 25% year-over-year. This is 2.5 times the number of visitors the RentPath apartment sites. With the acquisition of ForRent, it was no longer necessary to renew our two-year agreement with Move.com. We expect to be adding millions of additional unique visitors and visits from ForRent. We will save millions of dollars here by discontinuing that relationship. Throughout 2017, our Apartments.com network was ranked number one in traffic in 206 U.S. markets or 98% of all markets tracked, number two in just a small handful of markets. With the addition of ForRent, we’re now ranked number one in every U.S. market tracked. Our active rentals increased 31% in 2017 and we now offer 1.1 million apartment availabilities that have incredible value, bringing consumers and property managers together. In 2017, we delivered tens of millions of leads to apartment property managers and owners, resulting in more than 5.1 million leases that were executed because of our sites. 5.1 million Americans moved into homes they found Apartments.com in 2017. We are delivering meaningful traffic with real renters better than any one else in the industry by far. Our lead-to-lease conversion beats all others by far. Apartments.com had an excellent first year as we generally -- generated nearly 8 million visits to the site, resulting in 15 million property views. Our PR campaign generated 4 million impressions. Apartamentos.com is the only exclusively Spanish language rental listing site in the United States, with 20% of the U.S. renter market speaking Spanish, this is a tremendous market. Using Apartamentos.com, property managers can receive inquiries rentals, translate into English and Spanish. We’ll begin our new advertising campaign for Apartments.com on March 12, 2018, featuring Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower. I genuinely think Jeff Goldblum is absolutely loving this role. In 2018, we expect to reach 95% of the U.S. households with over 5 billion impressions with another robust natural campaign, which will run from March through September. Our TV campaign is expected to conclude 8,000 commercials. We’ve planed to use a combination of broadcast, cable and syndication television, so it we’ll be a top prime time shows, season premieres, major sports event, such as NBA Playoffs and college football. We will also be reaching the cord-cutting audience with on-demand video such as Hulu, and streaming video and device side, Roku, PlayStation and Xbox. Even my kids will see Jeff Goldblum. We’re going everywhere renters are including print and social media. Digital rental rate retargeting social media generates millions of visits and hundreds of thousands of leads a year. You will also be hearing Brad Bellflower on local radio. We plan to run an estimated 18,000 spots across 10 major markets. We will also have a strong presence on streaming audio platform such as Pandora and Spotify, we expect a number of impressions to exceed 100 million. With addition of ForRent sales teams, we now have nearly 350 people, salespeople in our multi-family sales force, actual producing line folks. Looking ahead with the best salesperson industry, we expect to continue to penetrate the market opportunity faster and provide unprecedented client service in the process as a top priority. Once again, CoStar Real Estate Manager continues to shine. It turned in another magnificent quarter of sales as companies continue to move to compliance with FASB ACS 842, pretty exciting regulation, which requires them to include the value of practically all leases on their balance sheets. In 2019, we estimate that over 3,500 U.S. issuers will be required to comply. And in 2020, another 1,500 private companies will be required to comply. It’s basically, a Y2K all over again for commercial real estate, and we believe we have the best accounting solutions or management solutions in the business. We only have about 5% at this point of total clients, and so we have a lot of room to continue to grow here. I expect that sales will remain strong from this group through the next couple of years at least. Real Estate Manager turned in its best year ever with a magnificent fourth quarter sales and a fantastic December. Looking at the chart, it pretty much just goes right through the roof in the last part of the year. In 2017, net new sales were up 183% over 2016. A CoStar Real Estate manager salesperson, Jerry Brink [ph], set the record for the highest subscription sales month ever in CoStar company history in December. In addition, Real Estate Manager turned in another solid quarter of notable client signings including nationwide Citibank, KeyBanc and Ingersoll Rand, Priceline, BNY Mellon, and one of my favorites, Rider Trucks. This business -- no really, they’re a great firm. This business is profitable and we’re investing in it to drive what we believe is significant long-term growth unique opportunity. A number of these folks to subscribed to CoStar Real Estate Manager also subscribed to CoStar. Over the past few quarters, we’ve released powerful new analytic capabilities into CoStar product. Our proprietary same-store rent series fully control for the changing composition of the properties and spaces on the market and offer the most accurate view our rent trends to properties submarket market for national level. We have also pioneered property level forecast to take into account every buildings recent performance, future leasing and current vacancies and rents. Finally, all of our analytic reporting is now truly realtime. Any time any of the CoStar’s 1,850 researchers updates information on the property or when one of our 100,000 some brokers who were putting in listings directly update something, that new information is immediately reflected in the forecast, the reports in the data export. We believe these features provide our clients with the best tools to analyze the state of commercial real estate market and gauge the outlook. To harness the full potential of this analytic tool kit, CoStar’s assembled a largest team of real estate analyst and industry, led by a seasoned team of Senior economist. Our data shows are broadly healthy marketplace. Commercial real estate vacancy levels are cyclical lows and pricing has reached all-time highs. In the office sector, vacancy has stabilized at 10.3% where they stood during the second half of 2017. It’s pretty healthy level. New construction remains subdued with overall construction numbers running at half of last cycles peak. Fortunately for owners of existing buildings, leases rolling over now had typically been signed three to five years ago, new lease rates are higher than those rolling over. Therefore, net operating income growth in the office sector is prime for good news since 2018, I think that’s true with a number of the asset classes. However, rent growth has slowed over the past year, the strong growth of 2015 and 2016 have given way to more typical gains, about 1.5% year-over-year for office, 2% for multi-family, 2.5% for retail. Industrial, on the other hand, continues to post extraordinary growth in excess of 5%. Other signs also point to a maturing cycle. REITs have underperformed the broad market over the past year. However, supply for industrial multi-family and office will put pressure on tight fundamentals. The homeownership rate has risen for four conservative quarters, heralding the end of an unprecedented era of moving one way towards apartment demand. Commercial real estate transaction volume, which reached all-time highs in 2016 was lower in 2017. And CoStar’s analysis of transaction data shows flattening prices. Cap rates also appear to have risen marginally in response to interest rate increases. That said, the string of good economic news, three quarters of healthy GDP readings and strong job numbers, as well as the passage of the Trump tax cuts, should provide some fresh tailwinds to real estate fundamentals. However, the encouraging economic data has also put to fed on notice and the FOMC raised the policy rate three times last year with future hikes expected this year as you know. The prospect of higher interest rates could erode an essential value proposition of commercial real estate this cycle, which was the widespread of derisk-free rates. For the multi-family sector, on the other hand, high interest rates may support more demand as would-be homebuyers are priced at the mortgage markets and continue to rent. If you have inflation as the primary discussion topic of 2018, it should be good news for the commercial real estate market which is viewed as an effective inflation hedge. Best of all, for the hospitality sector, which reprices daily. That said, when hot markets stabilize, some bad deals can get done, that’s why we’re building out new analytic offerings and strong news organizations to give our customers, brokers, property managers and owners/developers the tools to navigate these more volatile waters. Taken together, we see a healthy but maturing commercial real estate multi-family sector. If you have investments in commercial real estate, debt, equity or any CRE-related companies, we recommend you subscribe to CoStar as the best source to keep abreast of market developments as they happen. Also let your friends, colleagues and even vague acquaintances know. So 2017 was a fantastic year for CoStar, and we feel that we have more opportunity than ever. Recent developments, like investments to capture share following Xceligent’s bankruptcy and the opportunity to close, and the highly potential accretive ForRent acquisition have created margin pressure for the first half of the year. But we believe we’ll dramatically expand EBITDA generation in the immediate term and remain on track for our 40% adjusted EBITDA margin goals in 2018. And at this point, I’ll stop talking and turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler. Thank you, Scott.
Scott Wheeler: Thanks, Andy. It certainly was strong momentum exiting 2017, which, of course, sets us up for a very strong financial year in 2018 and beyond. As Andy mentioned, the revenue growth in the full year 2017 increased 15% over 2016. While our revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 16% versus the prior year. Organically, our revenue growth rate in 2017 came in at 14% for the year and 15% in the for quarter, after normalizing for the three small acquisitions this year and the THOMAS DAILY acquisition in 2016. Let’s look at our revenue performance by services. CoStar Suite revenue growth increased to 15% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus the fourth quarter of 2016. This came in above the top end of our 13% to 14% guidance range and accelerated from the strong 13% revenue growth rates in the first half of 2017. The strong revenue growth is, a large part, a result of our investment in Richmond in our research capabilities and in our success in converting the LoopNet information users to CoStar. We expect CoStar revenue growth rates to improve further in 2018 as we accelerate the LoopNet conversions and we reach more of the former Xceligent customers that are in need of commercial real estate information. Revenue growth rates for CoStar Suite are expected to be in 18% to 20% range in 2018, which is a significant increase from the approximately 13% revenue growth rates over the past two years. Revenue growth rates in the Information Services sector remained negative in the fourth quarter of 2017, as expected as we continue to wind down the LoopNet information products. As Andy discussed, we’ve decided to accelerate this conversion actively and effectively discontinuing the vast majority of our LoopNet Information Service offering by the end of February 2018. LoopNet information revenue is expected to drop from $32 million in 2017 to just $4 million in 2018, a reduction of almost 90%. Conversely, revenue from strong sales in our Real Estate Manager business and our other Information Services products line is expected to increase from approximately $40 million to around $52 million, a growth rate of almost 30%. As a result, we expect the total revenue from Information Services to decline at a rate between 20% and 25% negative on a year-over- year basis throughout 2018. Given our success to date up-selling this LoopNet information customers to CoStar, we expect more than offset all of this revenue decline with sales of CoStar Suite in the coming quarters. We had a very strong fourth quarter in multi-family, as revenue increased 26% year-over-year and 23% from an organic basis. As a result of continued strong sales, we expect organic revenue growth to continue at over 20% in 2018. With the addition of ForRent, we expect multi-family revenue growth of between 40% to 45% for the full year. Consistent with our initial estimates, we continue and expect the revenue contribution from ForRent to be the range of $75 million to $85 million on an annual basis post-integration. Finally, our commercial property and land revenue grew 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter 2017. Organic revenue growth, adjusting for approximately $2 million in revenue from the LandWatch acquisition, was 12% in the fourth quarter. Strong revenue growth continued in our LoopNet tiered advertising products, growing over 60% in 2017 versus 2016. While our LoopNet Premium Lister revenue growth moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of temporary disruptions from the CoStar LoopNet integration and our decision to discontinue certain non-subscription advertising products. We expect organic revenue growth in commercial property and land in the 12% to 14% range for 2018 with growth rate at the lower end of our range in the first half improving towards the upper end of our range by the end of the year, as our planned improvements are implemented and our sales force efforts accelerate. Gross margins came in at 77% in the fourth quarter, broadly in line with last quarter, down 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting our increased investments in research. Vast majority of our cost of revenue is related to our research operations, which are now broader and more effective than any time in the past. The related improvement in data and product quality is certainly producing the strong CoStar Suite sales growth we’ve been experiencing. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of $145 million were unfavorable to our forecast, primarily due to the higher commission expenses related to our outstanding fourth quarter sales performance. This was noted in the 8-K that we filed on January 17, 2018. In addition to the higher commission cost, we increased our marketing and other sales-related cost, as Andy described, late in the fourth quarter, following the Xceligent bankruptcy in order to reach customers that were suddenly without information solutions. Although unplanned, we expect these investments in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter of 2018 to generate significant returns in revenue growth this year and beyond. Finally, our cost associated with the Xceligent litigation and bankruptcy activities were $4 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our total spend on this matter to approximately $13 million for the year, in line with our expectations. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $78 million is approximately $9 million, below the midpoint of our guidance range, due to the higher commissions, CoStar marketing and selling expenses just mentioned. The resulting adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 31%. Our EBITDA of $237 million for the full year of 2017 represent to 10% versus the full year 2016, while adjusted EBITDA of $280 million increased 9% versus 2016. Net income for the full year of 2017 was $123 million, 44% ahead of the prior year and $9 million higher than we had expected. This $9 million of additional net income is primarily the result of lower income tax expenses, along with the reduction in interest expense related to the recent debt restructuring. There are a number of positive developments impacting our tax numbers this year, so let me walk you through the individual components. First, we recorded a $7 million tax benefit related to the change in accounting rules during the second quarter of 2017 for share-based payment transaction. Second, we recently completed the study of our research and development cost over the past five years, and we were able to recognize $8 million of research and development tax credits in the fourth quarter. Finally, we revalued our deferred tax liabilities in the fourth quarter to reflect the lower corporate tax rates prescribed in the new U.S. tax law that was passed in December 2017. this resulting in a $7 million benefit. Altogether, these items reduced our effective tax rate to 26% for 2017, down from the rates that were in the high 30s previous. Non-GAAP net income for the full year of 2017 was $154 million and includes our traditional adjustments for stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses as well as adjustments for the writeoff of prior debt issuance assets related to our Q4 debt restructuring. Our cash investment balances were approximately $1.2 billion as of December 2016, and we currently have no outstanding debt and maintain an undrawn revolving credit line with $750 million of capacity. Yesterday, we used $350 million of our cash to close the ForRent acquisition, and we’ll continue to evaluate investments in strategic acquisitions, in line with our growth strategy. Now let’s take a look at some of our performance metrics for the quarter. As Andy mentioned, our sales force, which totals approximately 725 sales reps at the end of 2017, delivered $23 million in net bookings in the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing 47% versus Q4, 2016, an all-time high for the company. This $43 million of net bookings includes a negative $9 million in net bookings in LoopNet information services. You recall, we stopped selling LoopNet information products when we integrated the CoStar and LoopNet databases in October. In the first quarter of 2018, we will discontinue the vast majority of our LoopNet information products. As a result, we expect almost $20 million of negative net bookings from LoopNet info products in the first quarter, as we terminate substantially all of our agreements with the month-to-month LoopNet information subscribers. Over time, we expect our sales team will continue to sell these customers our flagship CoStar Suite products for a net positive revenue result, but expect lower total net new sales in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the $42 million of net bookings we delivered in the fourth quarter of 2017. Renewal rates on annual contracts were 91.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017. These were up 90 basis points from the 90.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 30 basis points above the renewal rate achieved in Q3 of 2017. The sequential increase in the renewal rate is most notably a result of improvements in our multi-family business. The renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was 97%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 87% of our revenue in the quarter, up from 77% this time last year. I expect this number may temporarily decline, as we add the ForRent revenue to our metrics in the first quarter of 2018, similar to the impact of prior acquisitions in the space. I’ll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the first quarter of 2018. We expect revenue in the range of $1.17billion to $1.19 billion for the full year of 2018, which includes partial year ForRent revenue in the range of $65 million to $75 million. Excluding the ForRent acquisition, we expect revenue for the existing organic business to be in the range of $1.105 billion to $1.12 billion, which implies an annual growth rate of 15% to 16% over 2017. When we complete the integration of ForRent, we continue to expect full year revenue in ForRent in the range of $75 million to $80 million with eventual adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 45% to 55%. Currently, ForRent EBITDA margins are around 15%. We believe it will take 12 to 24 months to fully integrate the business. Accordingly, we expect the acquisition to be dilutive to our expected 2018 adjusted EBITDA margins by approximately 200 basis points. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2018 in the range of $269 million to $272 million, which includes our assumption of $7 million to $8 million in revenue from ForRent, representing approximately one month of revenue. Gross margins for 2018 are expected to remain at approximately the same level as 2017, prior to any purchase accounting amortizations from the ForRent acquisition. The amortizations related to acquired intangible assets will impact our cost of revenue, and this will likely increase. We’ll be able to provide more clarity on gross margin after our Q1 earnings release when we complete the purchase accounting for the acquisition. We expect total marketing cost to increase approximately 5% in 2018, prior to the ForRent acquisition, which is the first increase in our marketing spend level since 2015. The focus of our spend will shift towards increasing brand reach in our multi-family business, as Andy mentioned. Because in prior years, the advertising spend is more heavily weighted in the first half with the second quarter expected to be our largest marketing quarter, but as much as 40% of our annual marketing budget expended in Q2. As a result, we expect the second quarter to be the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year, as was the case in 2017. In 2018, we expect to continue to invest in growth initiatives, while, at the same time, growing our adjusted EBITDA margins. Our investments are focused on taking advantage of these unique growth opportunities, that Andy mentioned, in both our CoStar and multi-family businesses. For CoStar, we continue to build our product capabilities by expanding our field research, improving our tenant products, building on our news content. We’ll also add to our commercial real estate sales force to improve both the reach and market coverage of that team. In addition, we’re expanding our research capabilities in London. For multi-family, we’re investing in new software capabilities to benefit renters in Apartments.com, and we’re expanding our sales capabilities, primarily through inside sales. Additional investment initiatives are planned that will capitalize on these unique market opportunities. Overall, we expect approximately $25 million of spending in 2018 against these initiatives. Additionally, we will continue to incur legal fees related to the wind-down of the Xceligent litigation matters in order to protect our stolen data through the bankruptcy process as well as to conclude the open litigations that were ongoing in both India and the Philippines against the subcontractors. We’ve assumed approximately $4 million for ongoing Xceligent-related fees in the first quarter of 2018 with this cost diminishing in the second quarter and beyond. Considering these investment initiatives and before the impact of ForRent, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by around 350 basis points over 2017’s adjusted EBITDA margin. This equates to full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA margins of around 33% at the midpoint of our range. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year, including the ForRent acquisition, is approximately 31%, at the midpoint of our guidance range. We expect the adjusted EBITDA in a range of $365 million to $375 million for the full year of 2018, which includes approximately $5 million to $7 million of adjusted EBITDA associated with ForRent. Regardless of the near-term margin dilution associated with the ForRent acquisition, we remain confident that we’ll achieve our goal of the 40% margin exiting 2018. In the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $70 million to $74 million, which includes the negative impact of approximately $2 million from ForRent. The ForRent results are negative as a result of typical purchase accounting adjustments. In addition to the dilution from ForRent, as in prior years, the first quarter expenses include seasonally higher costs related to payroll taxes, our annual sales conference and annual standard increases for personnel. Our marketing cost also increased in Q1, as we increased spending ahead of the apartments rental season. Finally, we’re discontinuing the LoopNet information services in February, which has a negative impact to both revenue and EBITDA, again, that we expect we will recoup this as we continue to upsell these clients to CoStar over the coming months. We expect 2018 non-GAAP net income for diluted share in the range of $7.01 to $7.21 based on 36.5 million shares. For the first quarter, we expect non- GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $1.32 to $1.40 based on 36.3 million shares. These ranges include a revised non-GAAP tax rate of 25%, which is well below our previous 38% non-GAAP tax rate. This is primarily the result of the tax law changes enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017. This rate reduction has the effect of increasing our non-GAAP net income by approximately $44 million or $1.22 per diluted shares at the midpoint of our guidance range. In addition to the tax changes, CoStar will conform to the new accounting standard for revenue recognition in 2018, known as ASC 606, beginning in the first quarter. Impacts to revenue expenses are not material and are included in the 2018 outlook. Overall, I believe we are well positioned in 2018 to continue the acceleration of our revenue growth rates, while managing cost and investment to continue expanding our margins. I look forward to updating you on our progress as it goes throughout the year. With that, I will now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. I’d like to dig into your margin outlook. You’re continuing to target 40% EBITDA margins exiting 2018, but you’re elevating your investment spending in the first several quarters of the year. Out of the categories of investment spending that you’ve outlined, how much of that investment do you expect to be temporary in nature, thus giving you confidence that you can actually hit your 40% target?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. Hi, George. This is Scott. When you look at what we’re investing in, I listed a number of things, the expansion of our sales force, improvements in research, to continue expanding a little bit internationally, all those things are intended to go after these revenue growth targets that we have and also increase the revenue pace as we go forward. So what we’d rather do now is we go forward, unlike 2017 where we made significant investments and didn’t grow our margins. As we go forward, we want to keep pacing in these smaller investments as we go and keep raising the margins, like we’re doing now, the 350 basis points. So we balance the investing we need to fuel growth in the future with the margin improvements that we need to make to bolster our commitments and to give the returns that we committed to. So I don’t think I would call them temporary. The litigation cost we had in Xceligent, obviously, were temporary and we’ll see those moderate as we go through the year. But the rest of these things are worthwhile investments for the business.
Andy Florance: For things like integration of ForRent are temporary or the roadshows are temporary or the unusually high commission costs are temporary or the $0.5 million of chocolate baskets for Xceligent customers are temporary. High budgets are temporary. There’s a lot of temporary stuff in there that is spent in the first half.
Scott Wheeler: Definitely in the first part of the quarter, we had a good, at least, $5 million of those types of things.
Andy Florance: A man with the kids is impressed when I said I bought $05 million of chocolate over the weekend. I won’t do that ever again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Thanks guys. Super helpful commentary here. I know that you haven’t given us margins by segment in the past. And I was just wondering if you could just at least give us a sense of what the margin trajectory has been like, I guess, the last 12, 18 months in the multi- family side. And as you scale that to cover your fixed cost, how has that progressed generally?
Andy Florance: I’ll take a rough shot there. We aren’t describing -- we’re not reporting it at that level. However, I can give you a feel for it. I did a simple chart the other day of investments being big read, negative bar charts and then 4-wall profit being green. And basically, we went through -- in 2015 and 2016 -- 2015, we went through a very significant year of investment as we ramped up the nationwide brand advertising. Sales kicked up in 2016. Those investments basically dropped. Net investment dropped in half, as revenues offset. And we were -- I was very pleased in 2017 to see clear-cut strong 4- wall profitability in Apartments.com. And then after we get through all the noise and friction of closing a major acquisition, and even without it, then you move into even stronger margin growth. So I think the margins we’re seeing now, the contribution we’re seeing from Apartments.com is very successful and, certainly, dramatically more margin than we ever saw from the individual acquired company. So really good results of, I think, people that we’re very happy with.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good morning guys. In the – I want you to reiterate what you said on something, the incremental amounts that you guys are making on the incremental LoopNet user. I think you said the blended rate between the non-payers and the payers was something like $50 a user per month, and you’re making net $500. So just reiterate -- I want to make sure I got that right. And then how does that -- is that the data that we’ve gotten so far on the 5,400? And do we expect that same kind of pricing lift to continue? Or will it taper? I mean, are we getting the most juicy leads now and it should get less juicy over time in terms of pricing? Can you kind of go through that?
Andy Florance: Sure. Yes, so you’re right. It’s again just like the last time, we really pushed this a couple of years ago. The majority of the folks choosing to subscribe go from heavy searching in LoopNet to subscribing to CoStar to get better information product. There are folks paying absolutely nothing to LoopNet currently. So most of them are paying nothing. Those who are paying are $149. The blended rate is $49. We’re picking them up at about $520, $540 net, as they go into CoStar. So fantastic, 10 times sort of uplift. To answer your question, we gained the low-hanging fruit first, absolutely not. I sat there -- I’ve been in 20 or 30 cities in the last month and sat in a lot of focus groups watching people talk. And this is pretty straightforward to us. But as people sort out the differences between the different products and LoopNet as a marketing platform, CoStar as an information platform, it takes a little bit of time. Still, the number one competition of CoStar is these folks using the -- being heavy searchers in LoopNet or formerly using Premium Searcher. With the changes in integrated back-end, when these people go into LoopNet product today, they’re now seeing all the CoStar icon showing listings that they can’t see using their LoopNet account, and it’s a very compelling. And it will take a little bit of time. People aren’t going to immediately commit to a one-year, two-year, three-year CoStar contract. They’ve got actually sort out. Sales people got to have to meet with them. Honestly, we have a bigger opportunity than we have in a number of salespeople. We mitigate that. We’re shifting our resource around. But it’s something that takes time. And there isn’t something -- there’s still very significant system flow of folks who, we think, will continuously come in and upgrade to CoStar. February will be -- we are eliminating some of the center pricing we had in December, January. We’re being more rigorous in our pricing controls. But big picture, we anticipate it will flow throughout the year and into 2019, and it’s a very compelling proposition -- value proposition to folks. But it just isn’t something that would turn a switch and people will jump over. It takes time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Ridley-Lane: So LoopNet had roughly 1,700 paying customers. You had another 80,000 pretty intensive users. Given the conversions to date, you converted just 5% of the base. I’m curious what drove the decision to accelerate the conversion, particularly because you had the Xceligent bankruptcy, which is obviously a large opportunity that you need to capitalize on as well.
Andy Florance: Okay. So I think the number of subscribers is close to 32,000 because you have to look at folks who were getting Premium Lister with a subscriber element or unlimited listers. So the numbers is not -- I think it’s higher than 17,000. It’s closer to 32,000. And then you had another 50,000, 60,000 that we classify as heavy searchers on LoopNet. The reason you would accelerate -- like, so you’re -- originally, we had contemplated rolling out that Premium Searcher over a 12-, 18-month time frame just to continue the rolling time period. When you look at the folks who are using Xceligent as an information system, a very, very large number who were supplementing adequacies of Xceligent system by using LoopNet, so it’s actually one and the same thing. And the changes that occurred at Xceligent, you’re working against yourself when you are providing a Premium Searcher product to someone that you’re trying to convert into CoStar. So you’re probably -- you’re providing a low-cost, low-value product to them to prevent them from making a decision to go over to CoStar. And you plan to eliminate it anyhow and you communicated to them, prior to the Xceligent bankruptcy, you’re going to eliminate it anyhow. And also I think we have to work to a slightly higher standard now on how we treat all our customers given our increased competitive position. So we didn’t want to be in any situation where we are picking and choosing which markets or which people we eliminate Premium Searcher on and have any image that we were handpicking discontinued Xceligent clients to discontinue their Premium Searcher. So we went ahead and just did across-the-board and including, in some cases, making the right choice, but difficult choice to eliminate Premium Searcher with a person who was also subscribing to CoStar currently, so it’s just good customer service. But they’re related. They’re directly related. It’s one and the same decision-making process. And by doing this, we facilitate a faster, good result across the overall, though you take a -- it requires a little bit of extra character in the first half of the year.
(65:57.6) [indiscernible]:
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: So I want to go deeper into the conversions and the price. So you’re netting out $500 out of lease conversions. Given that huge untapped base that you still have yet to convert, based on the focus groups that you’ve done, what do you think is realistic in terms of how -- what percentage that you can bring over and at what price point? Because I think, at the beginning of the process, you’ve talked about maybe doing a $200 level of functionality, maybe a $400 level of functionality in CoStar. Has that kind of pricing approach or strategy more of that you’ve done more work in the space?
Andy Florance: Yes, it changed a little bit. So it’s a -- we initially were focusing on, as you said, the $200, $400. We’re not getting a lot of pickup in the $200. People are -- if they know what -- if they don’t know what they’re doing, some of them accidentally buy the $200. But this is what they do for a living. This is their trade. This is their Bloomberg terminal. And the $400 solution is incredibly powerful and gives them an amazing information solution with tons of revenue-generating opportunities. The $200 is adequate and meets everything that LoopNet Premium Searcher was doing and a lot more. So I think it’s probably 19 of the $400 to one of the $200. And that’s just what people are opting for it. And I think it’s actually shifting even further. So I think it will be like sub 5%, sub-3% of the lower cost solution at the customers’ behest. So -- and again, the focus groups is just amazing how they’re all just trying to figure out what’s going on. You’ve got Xceligent. You’ve got these board systems. You’ve got LoopNet Premium Searcher, Premium Lister. You’ve got CoStar. And you would think it was pretty easy for them to sort it out. There’s a lot of confusion out there. And what we’re doing is we’re really simplifying that decision-making process for them. And it will take years, so -- to sort of really simplify this and get them migrated into the right products. But we’re highly confident that a very substantial portion of these folks will ultimately be using CoStar for information and LoopNet for marketing. One of the things I don’t think we spend a lot of time on the call that did come out loud and clear in this most recent rounds of focus groups is one of the beautiful things here is LoopNet remains viewed by our customers as an essential utility to marketing their listing to end-users. CoStar is viewed as an essential utility for -- a very valuable utility for information solution. So as we’re doing this, the marketing side of LoopNet, to me, has never looked stronger. The information side in CoStar has never looked stronger. And there’s a whole bunch of painful confusion in the middle there in those information products, and it’s going to take years to sort it out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Oscar Turner: This is Oscar Turner on for Andrew. I was wondering if you can provide more color into line of sight to the 40% exit rate margin target by year-end. And how should we think about the likelihood that sustained strong sales momentum leads to higher-than-expected marketing expenses through the fourth quarter?
Scott Wheeler: So when you look at the progression, we expect -- as we commented on it, as our marketing ramps up into the second quarter, margins seasonally go down and then they pick up into the third and then go up higher in the fourth. We’ve seen that same pattern in the last couple of years and our spend is concentrated around the TV and the broadcast for the apartments marketing in the summer months. So we really don’t see that kind of pressure coming into the fourth quarter, unless something unusual happen. Like this year, with the bankruptcy of Xceligent, we went around and spent quickly and mobilized. That put in a few amount of dollars. There’s not enough time there to spend than the whole lot. So we don’t see a whole lot of.
Andy Florance: There’s a lot of competition, but there’s no Xceligent there.
Scott Wheeler: That’s right. So we feel pretty confident with where we’re pacing the marketing spend. And we don’t think it will cause any issue, as we go towards the margin at the end of the year.
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead
Bill Warmington: (72:09.0) So a serious question for you. So on the ForRent acquisition, you mentioned you’re going to be up bumping the size of the sales force on the multi-family side by 50%, which is a real positive. But last time, with Apartment Finder, when you had a big bump in the sales force, we ended up with a number of issues. What gives you confidence that those issues are not going to repeat this time?
Andy Florance: Bill, what sort -- Just remind me again, when you talk about issues, what sort of things come to mind.
Bill Warmington: The -- when you started to put the sales forces together that there are a lot of salespeople on the Apartment Finder side that you were changing around the commission structure, the sales territories, and a number of them left and had to be, either voluntarily or not, had to be replaced and that set us back.
Andy Florance: That’s a good question, Bill. So we -- we have grown the sales force over time and improve, globally reorganize it from time to time, as we have an unbelievable amount of opportunity to reach new customers on both the CoStar side and the Apartment side. In the Apartment side, one of the big drivers there is that people with smaller and smaller communities are spending money advertising on Apartments.com network. So we get to all of our customers or 95% of our customers every quarter for service, but we only get to 10%, 15% of the prospects every quarter. And we want to get to all of them every quarter. And one of our goals is to try to get to everyone with 50 units or up during the course of the quarter. Having a larger sales force helps us do that. The -- without a doubt, there are -- in any acquisition, there’s always cultural issues. Someone has been in a pattern doing something within a company for 15 years and there’s a big change like a merger with another company. People make decisions about what they want to do, and that’s healthy and that’s good. Some significant number will find the opportunity with Apartments.com really exciting. They’ll -- we think being on the clear-cut winning team is exciting. There’ll be, without a doubt, more earnings potential for them with the Apartments.com network. And some people may have been -- alternately, some folks will decide that the last 20 years at ForRent had been great and they’re going to do something else or hang it up now. They’re both fine. And we do anticipate and have planned for some number of people to decide to do something different. So that number will come down a little bit during the year. Eventually, we’ll rebuild it at a slow pace. But net-net, you’re going to end up with a great infusion of talented people that decide to make this their long-term hold -- home. And it won’t be the whole number that you start with, but it will be a good number. And they’ll also bring a lot of knowledge and culture and is valuable to us to rev up on everybody. So we’re sort of co-pathetic with -- change drives decisions in people’s career. And either way, we’re really glad to have the opportunity. So I don’t want. I hope -- I don’t to be too mellow about it, but that’s what I think.1
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP. Please go ahead.
Patrick Walravens: So a question for you, Andy, I think, which is how long do you think it will be until you’re ready to make your next major acquisition?
Andy Florance: 31 days, six hours and two minutes. Why do you ask? We -- there’s a lot out there, as you know, right? So we’re -- this is a pretty big one and we have to be reminded, right after closing ForRent, we were -- we’re spending a lot of time and effort continuing to look at all kinds of opportunities out there. There is a broad field. There’s a lot going on. I do think we’ll spend a little bit of time just focusing on ForRent and making sure we do that right. You have to respect -- when you close one of the largest acquisitions by revenue and headcount, you have to respect that and make sure you do it right and not get too confident. But no sure just stuff and -- so part of the bigger problem is selecting among an embarrassment of riches of opportunities to pursue. We are selective. We’re selective on valuation, so we won’t rush. But again, if you are betting against CoStar continuing to do acquisitions, you wouldn’t be a very good better.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sheldon: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question.
Andy Florance: Stephen, we really excited to have you on the phone.
Stephen Sheldon: Thank you. So yes, you talked about seeing research cost starting to trend down some this year. So a few questions on that. First, is that commentary on an absolute basis or as a percentage of revenue? And second, as we look out over the next few years, how much leverage would you expect to see in your research budget? I mean, do you need to add much more headcount to research at this point? Or just given the database integration and the improvements in data quality and automation from products, like Lifting Manager, could you keep your research headcount relatively steady over the next few years?
Andy Florance: I think it’s a thing that changes, and research is a -- as a percentage of revenue, it’s a pretty modest event -- investment. And it is a huge competitive advantage in the market. It’s the one thing that people continuously underestimate when they try to compete with us. As Xceligent failed, they joined a long list of folks who have invested well over $1 billion in competition with us, and haven’t gone anywhere. The number one reason is they just don’t invest in doing the research. So it’s been a long-term competitive advantage. But things are changing pretty rapidly. We have so many people in our network now that a lot -- the things are changing. A lot of people have a long-term relationship and doesn’t want to enter the data electronically, and they do it well. We are conservative about it. We don’t release this new ability to edit your listings in CoStar and then, overnight, make dramatic changes to our research process. We are studying it, discussing it. The focus groups were helpful in understanding that. And only when we know we’re not going to harm product quality, we make decisions to actually shift resources. There’s continuously new demands for different kinds of research. But my general sense is that, as the year moves on, we’re going to find that some significant portion of our traditional workload becomes automated. And that will allow us to keep the same headcount over time and not really grow headcount, so we can staff new initiatives without adding people, but that is sort of in the gut feeling category done from an extremely conservative operational point of view.
Stephen Sheldon: Got it. Appreciate the color
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
Andy Florance: Well, thank you very much for joining us on the call. And we look forward to updating you on our progress towards our 40% adjusted EBITDA margin goal in the Q4 of 2018, as we promised you in April of 2014.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the third quarter 2017 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you, operator. It's really great to be here today, and welcome to CoStar's Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. We hope you all will enjoy it. Before I turn the call over to Andy Florance, our CEO and Founder; and Scott Wheeler, our CFO, I have some very interesting and important items for you to consider. Certain portions of our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ, include but are not limited to, those stated in our October 25, 2017, press release, on our third quarter results and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar at the time of the call. We assume no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to all of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, including but not limited to, non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and forward-looking non-GAAP guidance are shown in details on our press release issued yesterday, which is also available on our website under costargroup.com. As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color on our website. So you can also find the CoStar information page there. Please refer to yesterday's press release on how to access the replay of this call once it's available. Remember, one question, make it a good one. I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andy Florance: Rich, I want to thank you for sharing that deep and personal information. I know that took a lot of courage.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you.
Andy Florance: Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter earnings call. The strong momentum we created in the first half of 2017 continued at an exceptionally strong pace into the third quarter of 2017. Year-over-year and sequential growth was excellent across the board. On a year-over-year basis, in the third quarter, our revenue growth accelerated to 16%, net income grew 48%, and EBITDA increased 26%. Sequentially, all three of our major revenue-by-services categories grew faster in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of this year. Our margins also rapidly expanded as adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 34%, up 1,100 basis points in the third quarter from 23% in the second quarter of 2017. Company-wide net bookings in the third quarter were up 31% year-over-year to $34 million, continuing an outstanding year in sales. Earlier this month, we completed the integration of LoopNet and CoStar, and our sales force began converting the LoopNet info users to CoStar users. I believe that based on results so far during the fourth quarter, the outlook for strong sales performance ahead is excellent. I'll have much more on this later. Overall, I believe we will see continued positive momentum during the rest of 2017, into 2018 and beyond. I'm truly amazed at the dedication and execution of the 3,600 CoStar professionals who have made us the number one platform in commercial real estate information and marketplaces. We are committed to constantly improving and building upon our prior successes to ensure that we continue to exceed client and investor expectations. In early October, we successfully completed an important secondary offering. Net proceeds in that share offering were $833 million. We restructured our credit facility, extending the term five years and increasing the size of the revolver to 750 million. And we pre-paid our outstanding term loan in full. Our cash balance today is 1,172,000,000, give or take a few dollars. We also have approximately 1.5 billion of buying power with our balance sheet. We believe we're in the perfect position with the utmost flexibility to move on the right deals when opportunities emerge. I want to thank everyone who made time in their schedules to meet with our management team on the roadshow. It was great to get on the road and discuss CoStar with many of our longtime and recent investors as well as many more considering investing in our company. I always value the insights that we glean on the road. To help build the best screens for our future deals, we recently asked Andre Benjamin, a former sell-side analyst with Goldman Sachs, to join us here at CoStar. I'm happy to say he joined us just this Monday. Andre covered CoStar from 2014 to early this year. Andre will work with Frank Carchedi and our Mergers & Acquisitions team, building, tracking and analyzing our list of opportunities. Completing the integration of LoopNet and CoStar databases and building a go-forward-product strategy is one of the largest and most complex projects we've ever completed. These were two massive databases with decades of information. This was an impressive feat pulled off nearly flawlessly by the teams of Frank Simuro, our Chief Technology Officer; and Lisa Ruggles, our SVP of Global Research. Close to 2,000 CoStar people worked hard for years to make this happen.  Now one database will power LoopNet and CoStar with the immediate benefit of higher-quality data on LoopNet and even more comprehensive coverage by CoStar. There will never be a listing in LoopNet that's not in CoStar. With the integration done, we are moving full force into our second cross-selling and up-selling phase with LoopNet and CoStar. The first phase occurred from 2012 when we completed the LoopNet acquisition until 2015. In that first phase, we converted 28,000 LoopNet users to CoStar, generating 80 million of net new sales. We achieved that strong sales performance despite a number of significant obstacles. Back then, the databases were not integrated, and while CoStar had more content than LoopNet, LoopNet often had some content that was not in CoStar. LoopNet used to have hundreds of thousands of free listings, providing a significant product substitution effect. Without integration, it was difficult to show prospects the clear differences between the databases. In the first phase, we continued to sell the lower-end LoopNet information product via e-commerce and it created a headwind to the up-sell effort. The second phase should be dramatically more powerful. Now CoStar powers the LoopNet database, so there're always twice as many listings in CoStar. If you count the fields and records advantage CoStar offers over LoopNet, there is 1,000 times the content in CoStar. Only CoStar offers information on fully leased properties.  This is valuable information because these are the buildings brokers want to win new listings in. Only CoStar provides information on millions of tenants, which are prospects for both brokers and owners. Only CoStar offers information on millions of comparable sales and leases used to value properties. Only CoStar offers statistics, analytics and forecasting. As of this month, we no longer offer new subscriptions to LoopNet Premium Search or Property Facts and Property COMPS so there's no competition or headwind to CoStar from this low-end products. Best of all, with a fully integrated back end, we can readily show prospects the CoStar advantage in every search.  Over the past few months, we sent marketing letters and pieces to over hundreds of thousands of active market participants, advising them of the important changes occurring in LoopNet and CoStar. We told them how we've optimized LoopNet to be a tool for commercial owners and brokers, marketing tenants, investors and end users. We explained that CoStar is optimized to give professionals a huge information advantage, making them the most informed one in the room. The letters, marketing pieces and end-product digital marketing is working. We have received thousands of inbound leads from commercial professionals wanting to learn more over the past two weeks. These leads supplement a list of about 100,000 LoopNet Premium Searchers or head researchers that we will focus on intensely over the next few years as our best up-sell prospects. This is a vast pool of potential revenue for us that we believe is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. I've anxiously awaited this integration for years, the earliest results are in, and they're fantastic. The first weeks have been nothing short of amazing for sales. We are out-of-the-box very strong and quick. Last week, I was meeting with various regional sales VPs getting status updates. Separately, two of them told me that what really got their attention was that our sales reps were now literally running in the halls. They had so many deals coming in, they did not have time to walk and they're now running. That sounds good to me.  Multiple VPs said that the middle of the month feels like the fast-paced typically only seen in the last two days of the month. We are closing at an astounding rate much faster than a typical sales cycle. It's not uncommon for 50% of the monthly deals to close in the last five days of the month. We still have a week of selling left in October, and many reps have already exceeded their quota for the month. We believe we are on our way to an all-time best month in information sales in October. Our pipelines are already filling up for November. As of last night, in a little over two weeks, we've generated over 622 LoopNet up-seller cross-sell deals worth $2.7 million in net new bookings. You'll notice that's up hundred or so from yesterday's press release. 474 of these up-sells were from LoopNet to CoStar. 148 were cross sales of LoopNet marketing. For the up-sells from LoopNet to CoStar, the average client had been paying 80 a month for LoopNet. After upgrading to CoStar, the average client began paying 470 per month or almost 6 times more.  Remember that LoopNet was sold as an individual license, and CoStar was sold as an enterprise license. So often under the new agreements, there are more licenses being sold to the same company, and more people using it. This is similar to the large up-sells we achieved in the previous phase, but the volumes are higher. We are seeing large deals closing at an incredibly fast pace. Typically 1,000 a month CoStar annual contract requires several meetings over several weeks or months. Many of these recent deals are closing on the spot or within 24 hours. A lot of these deals are national data deals for CoStar Suite, and we're converting individual brokers, who are using Premium Searcher for national data at 470 a month to CoStar National Suite data at 1,395 per month. Others are taking CoStar Suite at the state and multi-market levels at 995 a month or 695 a month, respectively. It's an early indication of what I've always believed. If you demonstrate the value of the information analytics, professionals will pay for it. It's not about the price; it's about the value that they can create. Our clients can leverage our products and generate great returns for the investments they make into CoStar. We're also starting to see combination sales of LoopNet and CoStar as shops are starting to see the benefits of using both of these very complementary service platforms. In Winston-Salem, Meridian Realty Brokerage had 11 users with an unlimited LoopNet Premium Lister plan at 940 a month. We were able to up-sell them to a company listing plan with a defined number of listings on LoopNet, and they've added a CoStar Suite subscription for a total increase of $3,700 a month. MoSingTel telling was that the principal decision-maker at the firm had been following the Xceligent case and made the comment, if I had been doing the business with Xceligent, I would have ceased my contract with them immediately. We have had many examples of customers who told us that they were trying to cobble together a cheap combination of LoopNet Premium Searcher and Xceligent. Now that they know everything from LoopNet is definitely in CoStar, they're buying a CoStar subscription and canceling Xceligent. Many don't even need a demo, they just say, send the contract over. We are meeting and re-signing former CoStar clients that we lost to lesser alternative information solutions. For example, we contacted a former client in Florida that used our CoStar Express product for 11 years. They switched to LoopNet Premium Searcher at $80 a month, and for the past 11 years, we repeatedly contacted them, try to resell them, they kept turning us down. Now with the integration, they moved quickly to a 695 regional deal in just 10 days after conversion period. Longtime broker holdouts are coming over in days to large contracts. We're getting into the door of shops that previously said no for years. In Reno, Nevada, we picked up a broker group that was a longtime holdout that relied on Premium Searcher at 90 a month. They signed up for 1,650 a month and cited the integrated back-end database as the reason they wanted to move over. Another new conversion came in at 1,365 per month in Salt Lake City. We picked up a small investor in Columbia, South Carolina for 815 a month contractor -- contract after years of them using Premium Searcher at $80 a month. Sales are not just coming from up-selling paying customers; free LoopNet searchers are converting all over the country. We signed on a new annual CoStar subscription in Dallas for 800 a month and one in Houston for 795. We're also seeing significant upsells at a legacy unlimited listing plans at LoopNet to larger defined plans. We added net new sales of 1,100 per month on a deal in El Paso and one for 2,000 in Houston. Several of our Regional Vice Presidents have commented how this feels like the heady days of early 2012 when we were doing the first LoopNet conversion. Others harken back the momentum that we had in March of 2015 for the big Apartments.com launch when we saw some of our best sales months ever. Customers are also extremely engaged. Because of our marketing outreach, they were well informed. We are hearing stories across the country of how we made it very clear about what LoopNet and CoStar brands deliver. It starts with a strong, simple message. CoStar's an information system and LoopNet is a marketing solution used for lead generation. We have clearly defined how each one should be used and give strong cases why a professional needs both. Our field sales reps are reporting that the industry has been well-prepped and brokers have been expecting a change. What is most encouraging is that the clarity on the service offerings is making things crystal clear for the market. To reinforce that CoStar is the information service, we have added a locked pin result feature in the LoopNet search results. We know who the heavy searchers are, and when they search in LoopNet, the results will show all the listings they do not have authorization to see as a locked pin. Those that are locked are available with a CoStar subscription. This makes the CoStar advantage visually obvious. We also deliver a pop-up digital marketing to the heavy searchers when they see the locked pins. They are receiving testimonials, stats and videos with their search results. Many brokers who thought LoopNet information was good enough are now seeing the tremendous upside to having a CoStar information subscription. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we expect to add an e-commerce capability to this locked pin comparison feature. Heavy searchers will be able to immediately sign up for a CoStar Suite subscription online. This is the first time that we'll be introducing e-commerce sales at CoStar, which I believe will become another strong sales channel for us. As you might have been able to glean, I am pleased with our initial sales results coming out of the gate and look forward to speaking to you about our fourth quarter results in February, when we'll have a much larger sample and more information on how we're doing. These are still early returns. This month, the CoStar-LoopNet integration brought another important advance. We launched our new listing manager interface, which give brokers greater flexibility and access in managing the listings in CoStar and LoopNet, and we're getting very positive feedback from brokers who began using it.  Anyone with a listing in commercial real estate, once vetted, will be able to access our listing manager. These professionals will be able to manage all of their listings in real time online, increasing the update frequency in our database, which improves the quality of our data. With a single entry, they'll be able to make changes all at once for all CoStar sites, including CoStar, LoopNet, CityFeet and Showcase. This should allow us to control our research costs as well. In our dashboard, clients will also be able to track the listing performance of their listings on CoStar and all of our marketing sites, including performance metrics such as views and search activity. They can even upgrade their advertising exposure across all of our sites with an enhanced tab that is larger and sorts higher in the search results. Now that we're strongly positioning LoopNet as the pure marketing brand, I believe we have an even larger opportunity with LoopNet. Today, we have approximately 300,000 paid listings on LoopNet, CoStar has 1.1 million active listings for sale or lease. This means there's nearly 1 million listings that are not yet advertised on LoopNet. In addition to more listings, there's also upside in offering differentiated advertising opportunities to LoopNet advertisers. Turning to the multi-family side in Apartments.com, Apartment Finder and the like. In multi-family, our net new bookings in the third quarter of 2017 continued to be very strong, with a 43% increase year-over-year versus the third quarter of 2016. We believe we've built the best user experience in the market, helping millions of people find new homes in our Apartments.com network. Better user experience, deeper content, effective SEO strategies and great marketing is consistently driving huge traffic growth, an advantage to the Apartments.com network, and it's positively impacting these sales results. Our acquisition of ForRent has not closed and remains in the HSR process with the Federal Trade Commission. We believe that it's obviously clear that there is very robust competition in the apartment marketing industry, and this deal should receive approval. Our initial filing was slightly delayed with the FTC. During the acquisition, we used the codeword Tidewater for ForRent because it's headquartered in the Tidewater area of Virginia, down in the Norfolk.  Tidewater was in the memo entry of the check we submitted to the FTC for the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing fee. Unknown to us, there's an Iranian company with Tidewater in its name that has known terrorist affiliations. This caused our checks to the Treasury Department to be flagged and mysteriously disappear with no explanation. Took a while to figure out. Crazy, but true. We resolved that issue at the end of the first 30-day period. The FTC agreed that withdrawing and refiling our HSR paperwork in order to give them additional time to complete the review of the deal would be beneficial, and we've done that. We expect our pending acquisition of ForRent.com will further add to the positive renter experience we deliver to millions of renters and will bring large efficiency gains and greater value to our advertisers. We are working through the regulatory review process at this time, and we continue to expect a fourth quarter close of this acquisition. It's not a great idea to take a lot of Q&A on legal issues. Overall, we are very pleased with the tremendous progress we have made in the multi-family space in the past three years. We still have a long way to go and believe this is a multibillion-dollar opportunity since we currently have less than 10% of the apartment buildings that are 5 units or bigger in the United States paying for advertising on our site. CoStar Real Estate Manager, an important product of ours, provides market-leading real estate management software to retailers and global companies. FASB accounting rules are always changing and beginning in 2019, public companies must begin filing revised financial statements to account for leases under FASB ASC 842. In particular, the new standards require companies to include the value of practically all leases on their balance sheets. In 2020, we estimate that over 5,000 U.S. issuers will be required to comply. This is like a Y2K event for real estate in public companies, and we're uniquely positioned to capture a huge amount of this business. CoStar Real Estate Manager offers an industry-leading module that is designed to help companies get in compliance with FASB ASC 842. We are a clear leader in the space, and we're one of the first to market in early 2016 our features. Because of its superior service offering, CoStar Real Estate Manager is having a fantastic year. In 2017, we've added new customers, including Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, GE, BB&T, Quest Diagnostics, Bank of New York Mellon, HD Supply, Dr. Pepper Snapple and CoreLogic. Our services extend to the international markets for IFRS standards as well. And in the third quarter, we signed Saint-Gobain, based in Paris, for a significant net new bookings deal. Year-to-date, net new sales were up 149% compared to the first nine months of 2016. Average deal sizes have doubled, and so have the number of deals. This business is expected to generate approximately 20 million in '17 and has the potential to be a significant grower in each of the next three years. Renewal rates are in the low- to mid-90% range, and most contracts are three years in length. We have some encouraging developments on the Xceligent litigation front that we can share with you. On Monday, a United States federal judge entered a judgment in CoStar's favor against one of Xceligent's primary research providers, RE BackOffice. The court found that they conspired with Xceligent to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, assisted Xceligent's infringement of our intellectual property and engaged in unfair competition against CoStar. The contractor admitted that they illegally copied CoStar's content into Xceligent's database, and that Xceligent's management directed circumvention of CoStar security and ordered the copy of CoStar's content. The facts could not be any clearer. Xceligent, a foreign-owned company, has built its commercial real estate information product by copying CoStar's content without our permission. Their copying of our data and images is pervasive throughout their product. While expensive and difficult, it may be possible for Xceligent to remove many of the copyrighted images it willfully misappropriated. It's too late and it may never be possible to unscramble and remove the massive amount of information they illegally misappropriated from us and mixed throughout their database.  With the wealth of evidence and testimony, it is clear that Xceligent went offshore and illegally used LoopNet CoStar's CityFeet, Showcase, Apartments.com and other CoStar assets to build their competing database. One indication of the strength of our case is that as of now, three different judges have ruled in CoStar's favor across the broader case.  Doug Curry, when he was Xceligent's CEO, had continued to deny the allegations and even implied that because CoStar was a successful US company and Xceligent was not, they somehow were entitled to rewrite the law and use CoStar's product to build its own. His perverted philosophy says that it was anti-competitive for CoStar to secure our computer servers to stop this company's high-volume theft of content. Doug Curry was the Founder and CEO for 19 years. Within hours of the publication of the judge's finding of conspiracy in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and infringement and unfair competition, Doug's employment was terminated. Very, very hard to believe that, that's purely a coincidence. This comes on the heel of a number of senior executives that Doug was reporting into at DMGI, leaving to pursue other opportunities immediately after we originally filed our lawsuit against their sub-Xceligent. We believe that Xceligent's research providers' admission of wrongdoing, which it describes as Internet piracy and the judge's ruling, significantly bolster our ongoing case to stop Xceligent from illegal copying and reselling of CoStar content. This is a major development because a third-party vendor of Xceligent has confirmed that what we found -- what we found to be true in our investigations. Xceligent's actions were intelligent -- sorry, were intentional and highly egregious.  Our investigation found over 3,000 fraudulent CoStar Group passwords created by Xceligent's researchers, who were responsible for 2 million unauthorized hits against our servers. Bisnow reported that RE BackOffice court documents contained a concession of wrongdoing, including that Xceligent directed it to hack into CoStar's databases and websites and copy its content. According to the article, RE BackOffice names Xceligent CEO, Doug Curry, and Chief Researcher Officer, Nathan Lipowicz as being directly involved. We're all about fair competition. We encourage any broker or owner in the commercial real estate industry to share and market their listings on any platform they wish. We welcome it and we believe we'll continue to succeed because of our superior service offerings. But as Xceligent's research provider admitted using competitors' content to compete directly with them is wrong and against business rules of fair play. We think the significant ruling against Xceligent's research provider and these terminations say all that needs to be said about the status of the litigation. Update you quickly on the commercial real estate markets we operate in. The commercial real estate markets in the United States continue to perform better than the general economy. Much of the strength stems from the solid and stable job gains, strong capital flows and restraint in construction lending outside of the multifamily sector. The apartment market on average has high-occupancy rates, and the nation's steady economy is driving demand for the Apartments underway.  This is good as by the end of 2018, we estimate the apartment market will have delivered 1.2 million units over a 5-year period. The market has not seen this kind of construction activity in the past few decades. Yet most of the space has been absorbed, as single-family home construction has lagged. The homeownership rate has compressed, and a whole new renter class, the renter-by-choice empty nester, has been created. While vacancy rates nationally have ticked up by only 30 basis points from their cycle lows last year, different price points in the apartment market have fared differently. The top end of the market Class A properties, where the new construction has delivered, has been wrestling with higher concessions, more turnover, longer lease up, and in select markets, even negative rent growth. The middle and lower segments, which is the nation's -- most of the nation's apartment base, continue to see rent growth and increased capital flows. Since apartment advertising spend is highly correlated with vacancy levels, a more competitive apartment market is good news for Apartments.com and our sales efforts. In the office sector, vacancy rates have been stable in the 10.1 to 10.3 range for the past 1.5 years. These were also the lowest reported vacancy levels of the last cycle. Most of the ongoing construction activity is concentrated in a handful of markets such as New York, Dallas and the Bay Area. While office rent growth is likely to remain about the level of inflation for the next year, landlords and brokers should continue to do better than that as leases signed 3 to 5 years ago are now rolling into substantially higher market rates. In the meantime, the industrial market has never been stronger, very strong demand levels, much of it driven by e-commerce, have combined with rational levels of supply to support high-occupancy rates and solid rent growth. The retail market has never had to face larger headwinds than it does today. That said, on average, the retail market is not as dire as the headlines would make you believe. Retail is demonstrating positive demand for space and new supply levels are low. Total investment sales activity is averaging about 90 billion per quarter in '17. This is a decline from about 105 billion this time last year. I don't believe it's significant. Cap rates are historic lows, are turning investors and developers who are pursuing build-to-core strategies. We expect vacancies to remain at or close to their cycle lows, demand for space positive, and rent growth to, at a minimum, keep up with inflation. These market conditions are combined with ongoing job and GDP growth are favorable to CoStar's platform, which serves the marketing, leasing and transaction programs for brokers, building managers and owners. These conditions are even more suitable to the deployment of CoStar's market analytics initiatives. So in conclusion, I'm very pleased by the continued momentum we have achieved in the first three quarters of '17, with both the top and bottom lines growing and expanding nicely. Our Apartments.com network continues to deliver stellar results. The early returns on the LoopNet-CoStar integration are outstanding, with our sales force fully energized and selling up a storm. We expect to exceed our goal of 1 billion in run rate revenue exiting '17 and we're well on our way to achieve our goal of exiting '18 with a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin. At this point, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. I know there's really a lot going on in the third quarter fairly on a positive result, nothing like taking on a major product integration with CoStar-LoopNet, signing an important new acquisition with ForRent, executing common stock offering, restructuring debt, and by the way, we also turned on the Oracle cloud ERP system on October 1, so nothing like a quiet quarter here at CoStar. Yeah, great results. Revenue in the third quarter, as Andy mentioned, is up 16% over prior year. And we see the acceleration in all our major revenue growth rates on our primary revenue streams versus the prior quarter. Our organic growth rate in the third quarter was 14%, and that normalizes out the acquisition of WestsideRentals, The Screening Pros and LandWatch, all of which we closed earlier this year, as well as the effects of THOMAS DAILY, which we closed in the second quarter 2016. Let's look at the revenue performances by our services. CoStar Suite revenue growth improved to 14% in the third quarter 2017 versus third quarter 2016. And this is after reporting strong 13% growth rates in the first half of 2017. We certainly expect CoStar Suite growth rates to continue at 13% to 14% for the rest of 2017. We expect to see continued strong performance going forward as we hit full stride in the cross-sell of CoStar services to LoopNet information services that Andy talked about. The revenue growth rates in information services remained negative in the third quarter, as expected, as we continue to wind down the LoopNet information products. The revenue decline from the LoopNet information products in the third quarter was moderated by the double-digit growth in our portfolio of strategies and the Real Estate Manager business. We expect the Information Services revenue decline to accelerate in the last quarter of the year as we actively convert clients to CoStar.  We expect full year revenue in Information Services to decline in the mid-single digits, which is a slight improvement compared to our previous range of an 8% to 11% decline, which comes from our Real Estate Manager acceleration. We had another very strong quarter in multi-family, as revenue increased 25% year-over-year and 22% on an organic basis. This is adjusting for the two small acquisitions. Revenue contribution from these two acquisitions was approximately $2 million from the quarter, which we expect will decline as we complete the integration of these two businesses in the quarters ahead. Consistent with last quarter, a little over 75% of the organic revenue growth in multi-family was the result of adding new paying properties, while the remaining 25% of our growth came from customers selecting more valuable advertising packages. In fact, our highest value advertising package, called the Diamond level, grew almost 50% year-over-year in terms of growth in the number of advertising packages. Based on continued strong sales performance, we expect our full year 2017 growth for multi-family revenue, before any contribution from ForRent, to be in the range of 23% to 24%, which is an increase to the range of 21% to 23% we discussed last quarter. And last but certainly not least, commercial property and land grew 21% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2017. Organic revenue growth, adjusting for approximately 2 million in revenue from the LandWatch acquisition, was 14% in the third quarter, well above the 11% revenue growth we reported in 2016.  The improved growth rate is a result of our increased focus on selling LoopNet Premium Lister and tiered advertising to the property owners. We expect organic trajectory in this business to be in the 14% to 16% range for the full year of 2017. Including revenue from the acquisition of LandWatch, we expect commercial property and land services to grow in the range of 17% to 19%. Turning to gross margins. We came in at 78% in the third quarter, up 100 basis points from the second quarter, as revenues continue to grow and our research investment spending has leveled off. The vast majority of cost of revenues relate to our research operations, and we remain very pleased with the productivity improvements we've seen from our investments in the new research center in Richmond, Virginia. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 135 million were favorable to our forecast, due to cost-saving efforts, slower-than-expected hiring, and shifts in the timing of our marketing spend. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA of 84 million in the third quarter exceeded our guidance range by $14 million and represents an increase of 25% versus the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 34% in the quarter, up from 23% in the second quarter of 2017 and up from 32% from the third quarter of 2016. Our cash and investment balances were approximately 633 million at the end of September 2017. And in the third quarter, we generated $65 million of cash from operating activities while capital spending remained low. Our cash balance today is approximately $1.2 billion, of which $350 million is earmarked for the completion of the ForRent transaction, which we expect to close before the end of the year. Now let's look at some performance metrics for the quarter. Our sales force, which totals approximately 730 sales reps, delivered $34 million in net bookings in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 31% versus Q3, 2016. This is our third consecutive quarter of net bookings over $30 million, which continues to demonstrate the returns we're getting on our research, sales force and product investments. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect to see a significant lift in sales from our CoStar cross-selling efforts, as Andy discussed. At the same time, our net bookings in LoopNet information products are expected to decline at a much faster rate than they have in the previous quarters, reflecting the shift to CoStar and the elimination of online sales of LoopNet information contracts. We expect the shift in net bookings out of LoopNet information and into CoStar to be net positive. However, it's too early in the quarter to actually predict the outcome of these efforts. Given the timing of the sales in the fourth quarter 2017, we do not expect a significant impact to reported revenue until 2018. Renewal rates on annual contracts was 91% in the third quarter of 2017, up 30 basis points from 90.7% in the third quarter of 2016 and up 40 basis points above the renewal rates we achieved in the second quarter of this year. The renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 97%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 78% of our revenue in the quarter, which is up from 76% this time last year. I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and in the fourth quarter of 2017. These numbers exclude any impact of the pending ForRent acquisition, the outlook of which I will discuss in a few minutes. We're raising our revenue outlook by approximately $77 million at the midpoint to a range of $962 million to $965 million based on continued strong sales momentum.  We expect revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 in the range of 251 million to 254 million, representing top line year-over-year growth of around 16% at the midpoint. We're also increasing the company's 2017 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to a range of 287 million to 291 million, an increase of $17 million at the midpoint, based on the revenue increase and the stronger third quarter profitability. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of 85 million to 89 million. We expect 2017 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $4.65 to $4.73, and that's based on 33.6 million shares. The non-GAAP net income per diluted share outlook includes approximately $0.11 dilution related to additional shares from our recent common stock offering, offset by approximately 2% - $0.02 of improvement related to lower-interest expense in the fourth quarter after paying off the company's outstanding debt. Favorable revenue and expense trends in the second half of the year contributed approximately $0.31 per diluted share versus the previous guidance range, more than offsetting any dilution from the recent offering. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $1.31 to $1.38 based on 36.2 million outstanding shares. Costs associated with the Xceligent litigation were approximately $3 million in the quarter. And we expect the cost in the range of $13 million to $14 million for the year, a slight improvement from the $15 million we communicated previously. We expect our acquisition of ForRent to close late in the fourth quarter of this year. Accordingly, we expect ForRent will contribute between $6 million to $8 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and be slightly dilutive on a non-GAAP net income per share basis due to the impact of integration and purchase accounting adjustments. Our view of the post-integration profile of ForRent has not changed. We still expect the post-integration business to settle in the range of $75 million to $85 million in revenue, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 45% to 55%. We expect it will take approximately three to four quarters following the acquisition closing to achieve the run rate results. In closing, we believe our strong sales momentum and updated revenue guidance will enable us to reach our goal of $1 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter of 2017. And we remain on track to reach our goal of a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018. In addition, we further strengthened our balance sheet and we're well positioned for continued strong growth, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. With that, we can now open up the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question would come from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, one moment.
Brett Huff: Thanks for all the details and particularly the LoopNet up-sell. A lot of folks have been, I know, very focused on that. My question is on bookings growth. I know this is sometimes a frustrating question to get asked. But 31% was a deceleration from, I think, the 39% growth last year or last quarter. And I wondered, just give us thoughts on that, was there some distraction of the sales force as they get trained up for Loop? I think you guys said in last call that maybe half of the 700 and some odd would be focused on this. Was there a tough comp? Just any thoughts on that would be helpful because folks have asked us about that. Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, sure, Brett. Q2 obviously was a pretty phenomenal quarter, record net sales numbers. And we had this record sales number in CoStar Suite, which was obviously a very positive. We had some pretty large national deals that were in there, which helped us in that quarter. So when you look at Q3 across all of our product groups, they performed very strongly and I think that the two factors I'd call out was, one, we didn't have any big, large national deal in the fourth or in the third quarter. And also we lost a number of selling days around a couple of our regions as we dealt with - clients impacted by the Houston hurricane, the Florida hurricanes, and we backed off on, obviously, sales. And we also did some crediting for distressed clients there. It's not a huge impact, but it does sort of dampen the output. And then there was some getting ready for the CoStar LoopNet integration that occurred in the last month in the quarter. So I think all those things combined gave us a little softer than Q2. But still we're very happy with where that is, and we're averaging about 35 million a quarter this year in net new, which is a nice place to be.
Andy Florance: So, just to add to that. I would just say that the focus in the sales force was 100% on the upcoming Loop integration. So that was the topic of the quarter. And so as you approach that integration period, there's a lot of energy, a lot of preparation going into that integration, which will be the highlight of the next two years. That will be the drumbeat that we're following for the next two years. And so in the lull right before you set off on that big effort, people weren't launching new major initiatives somewhere else. So it just was more of a timing issue where you're building up for what we've been describing in the last two weeks, which is a really strong result. The other thing on the apartment side is that we had intentionally slowed down our efforts to take business from ForRent, which we have an agreement to acquire. So that also had a little bit of an impact. So big picture, good things happening, more timing issues with exactly what you're trying to do, what emphasis you're putting on what's allowable.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi.
Pete Christiansen: A lot of good information, a lot to chew on this quarter. Just some quick ones. Andy, I know it's early but any thoughts on the pace of the campaign given the first couple of weeks here? Is this something you think you may want to accelerate? Or it's status quo for now? And my second question was to Scott. I know you mentioned the offset bookings is going to most - a net positive on the conversion. But I guess, how do we think about that on a recurring revenue basis? Would it be roughly the same impact? I know you're not turning off everybody at once.
Andy Florance: So, in terms of accelerating it, right now I would say we are measuring it. And the pace of the lead flow right now is massive. So we are just trying to keep up with the pace of the lead flow that's coming in. And so we will continue to assess that and figure out how we try to scale to take advantage of that. I think the e-commerce modules coming up later in the not-too-distant future will help us process more of those leads electronically, immediately. But I think that if you just - if you look at the press release and my statement today - the press release from yesterday and the statement today, the pace of 100 contracts a day, that's sort of unprecedented for us. And we will look for ways to accelerate probably relying on e-commerce to help there a little bit. I'll let Scott answer the second question.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. The perspective on bookings and what we see going forward, as you can imagine, there's a good bit of noise that gets introduced in October that we're sifting through now. The very positive noise, obviously, from the pipeline and then the new sales and the uplift that we'll see in CoStar Suite. And then there's the noise around the info services declining both from the shift of CoStar and also that we no longer sell those to our e-com platform. So that's - it's interplay between those two that we are seeing as a net positive right now in the fourth quarter. There's also other minor, let's say, near-term disruptions that you'll see as you make a conversion of this scale in the LoopNet marketing business, has to do with users having new interfaces, new places to go, figuring out their listings between the two sites. And so you see a little disruption in the first couple of weeks, but we've recovered from those and we'll see those recurring like we have in the past. So all in all, even though we don't forecast our bookings or communicate bookings forecast, we'll see a little more range of variability in the quarter, but I wouldn't expect to see us much different than where we landed in the third quarter as we go in towards the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
David Ridley-Lane: Now that the LoopNet is a pure-paid marketplace, do you have any early indications of behavior? I think there were about 100,000 free listers. Are you starting to see them soften up to, at least, to the basic ad package? And maybe to set the backdrop so that we're all on the same page, can you give us the number of paid advertisements on the site and the average revenue per listing? Thanks.
Andy Florance: Sure. So yes, we've been watching that, I think there's 128,000 free listings or something at the point of conversion. And we've been very pleased with the response we've received from those folks. So they get - they basically understand that there are paying advertisers and that their free ads compete with the paying advertisers' exposure. And so not a big surprise to them that it's becoming a pure-paid marketing marketplace. Again, in the first week or so, I believe we've had over - first two weeks, we've had a 100-some-convert. And my sense just anecdotally this early is that we'll see a lot of those folks move in to basic packages. And we extend some pretty good discount plans and easy entry points for them. So I would expect that we would do very well in that audience. We are intentionally prioritizing our sales resources against the information side initially, that's the one that goes by very rapidly, and we want to make sure we're on top of that as a first priority, and we've taken some of the folks who were selling the LoopNet product - develop some LoopNet product to help process some of the more remote - geographically remote candidates for CoStar up-sell. So the results are good. And I have to say that I was watching what kind of reaction we got from those free listers and I am very happy with the way they responded. So just again, timing for six months or so, it's 100% about how are we making sure we're capturing this information opportunity and that will continue for two years or so, but tuning it for six months or so. And then the LoopNet sales effort happening now, but really hitting its crescendo in '18. So they're waves because they have to be. In terms of number of paid listings - it's 300. The 300,000 paid listings. And then in terms of price per listing, sub-$20.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, it's not very high.
Andy Florance: Yes, it's not high. And that was - that's an important issue because, remember, prior to our acquiring LoopNet, they pretty much sold one-size-fits-all. They just sold a standard ad and they sold it to commercial real estate brokers. Commercial real estate brokers, the person paying for the ad only gets about 1.5% of the deal. The owner's getting 95% of the deal. Sub-$20 is really low. And if you look around the world and you look at SeeLodge, Scout24, Rightmove, REA Group, Zillow, any of these folks or Apartments.com, our own property Apartments.com, we're getting $7,000 per advertiser and some folks are getting up to $30,000 per advertiser. We're doing couple of hundred bucks for advertisers. I think as we offer more tiered listings and enhanced listing opportunities as we do with the Apartments.com and as we target the owner opportunity, I believe that those numbers will soar and grow really dramatically. So that's our primary focus. And whatever anxieties I had around how the free folks reacted, those are gone.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: So first of all, congratulations to Andre Benjamin, nice to see you hiring a recovering sell sider.
Andy Florance: We have him in therapy right now.
Bill Warmington: So, I wanted to run through some of the math that you gave earlier. So if you talk about $2.7 million in bookings that we've seen so far, on 622 new deals, that would imply about $360 per month in revenue lift that you're seeing. But question is, you're really looking at two different opportunities here, right? You've got the LoopNet Premium Searcher converting to the CoStar Suite, and it's like 474 of them. And then you've got the free lister to Premium Lister conversion. And I just wanted to try to parse the contribution to that $2.7 million a little better just so that when we're doing the modeling of what the opportunity could be, at least, using figures that make sense.
Andy Florance: Yes. Is it 80% is information right now of the revenue?
Scott Wheeler: Yes.
Andy Florance: 80% of that 2.7 is info. And again, we have - as John Paul Jones said, we have not yet begun to fight. So we have not yet entered the field on the advertising side. So the free-to-client movement on the advertising side will be significant. But I really think the much, much more significant opportunity will be as we remove more and more of the clutter on the LoopNet site associated with low-end broker products and we focus the site more to higher end product like beautiful office towers and high-end shopping centers and create a more high-end advertising opportunities with using the 3D imagery we’ve used so successfully in the Apartments.com and the videos and whatnot. I think that the bigger story is going to be when owner starts - when we start selling higher volumes of $1,000 a month, $2,000 a month ad packages with a lot of exposure. So we're doing all sorts of things to grow the upper end and the free to pay are good, that could be a lot of money. But the huge money is going to be meeting the needs of the people who have $300 million speculative office building developments in a 5% marketing budget that’s’ going be our primary focus. So we have a number of different initiatives underway there. So you may have seen the redesign, probably not. We've redesigned the home page and we put up a wealth of news there. We've begun to build a much larger news team to engage people more emotionally in the site, create more ad opportunities. And so you'll start to see the full pace of that in '18. You'll start to see some interesting news around that. So I'm very excited about that, getting good results on the free-to-pay now. But getting phenomenal results on our primary focus, which is the information side. And I know, like, for instance, we just added some key players to our product team on the LoopNet side around designing towards the higher end opportunity, so...
Scott Wheeler: The other encouraging piece of news when you look at the contracts we're closing are folks that are now buying CoStar are buying the information side. Half of those contracts were paying us something before, half of those contracts were paying us nothing before on information. So that's very positive news for us to see that's kind of a split.
Andy Florance: The other positive thing is that if I roll back four years ago, the market - there was confusion in the market. They would sort of say, "Well, gosh, I'm either buying LoopNet or I'm buying CoStar." And they really hadn't got their heads around the value prop - the relative value propositions. Now we're signing up a lot of business, I imagine a lot of those contracts on the advertising side are situations where the person - I mentioned some of them, where the person's doing both CoStar and LoopNet contracts aggressively buying significant marketing plans on LoopNet and significant information plans on CoStar. So that's the best news is that these aren't either ors, these go together and they complement each other beautifully. They're solving two huge problems for our clients, one is their information need and the other is how do you reach a buyer universe of millions of end-users. So hopefully that gives you some color. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Andy, the initial result of a cross-seller are pretty impressive as you recited chapter and verse. How do you feel about the productivity and the capacity of the sales organization? I know at times of accelerating growth in the past, CoStar's gone out and made meaningful sales force investments and I think you've invested in front of this cross-sell cycle. But I just want to check in and see where you're headed at as far as, perhaps, having to scale up that sales force in line with the nice success you're having on the cross-sell side?
Andy Florance: Yes, so you're correct. And thank you for pointing that out, Andrew. We did invest ahead of this. So we added 88 customer relationship managers to support the effort and specifically to do this. We ramped that team up during the course of the year and the prior four quarters and got them to roughly full strength in advance of this integration effort. We have grown the sales force a bit there. We have begun to grow on the inside sales team around the efforts. So we do invest in advance. One of the ways I'm looking at it, which is a little different than normal is how we - when a significant percentage of your sales force has made quota by mid-month, which is highly unusual, you have to actually begin to manage the sales force a little bit more around making sure that nothing - none of the opportunities are slipping by because they're doing really well. Like, we need to sort of extend our expectations on productivity for the sales force because they can, I think, the sky's the limit on what that they can do. I do not believe right now that adding more bodies is necessary. And I do think that e-commerce can do a lot with the lower-end opportunity. So both LoopNet and CoStar have been observing and working with and interacting with tens of thousands of these brokers for years. We know who they are, we know how many properties they have, we know how many people are in their firm, generally speaking. And when they go into LoopNet and they see this locked pin interface, and they can clearly see the dramatic information advantage CoStar would offer them. And they're the only one seeing, the end-users don't see that mode. They immediately want to learn more about upgrading to CoStar, and in the first two weeks, we had 2,500-plus - more than 2,500 people submit leads to us who were on that locked-pin system. And we want to give them the ability to just electronically buy immediately, just use their existing contract authority with us or a credit card to immediately buy, which would solve some of the constraints of the sales force.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with B. Riley.
Unidentified Analyst: So a quick follow-up on the multi-family opportunity you guys have. I think you mentioned in the call a significant TAM of apartment sizes of 5 units and above, but you've also talked about in the past how the TAM of apartment side is about 5 units and below are significantly larger. Could you kind of quantify what you see is the larger tail opportunities as you guys moved and target those smaller 5 units or below apartment complexes?
Andy Florance: So traditionally, the industry, the apartment marketing industry, the folks producing publications for supermarket checkout counters and the like around the apartment industry, they targeted properties 120, 150 units and above. And when we had bought Apartments.com, we began focusing on - and that's probably only - that world is probably only about a quarter of the apartment units in the United States, a huge swathe of them are 5 units to 120 units, 150 units. So we have had huge success in the last two years selling to people who have 50 units or 30 units or 80 units. And it probably makes sense people that owned 80 unit apartment buildings are absolutely good prospects for advertising, or even 10 units, right? And so we can see - we can quantify given the rates we're currently achieving in the high-end and the middle that, that's in excess of a $2 billion TAM. And as you get to smaller unit size - smaller property sizes, people pay dramatically more in marketing because they don't have in-house - they want to invest more in marketing because they usually don't have in-house marketing and leasing. And then the biggest one is the sub-5 units. So that's basically little walk-up properties, condos, townhouses, single-family homes, that's about 22 million-plus units. And that's probably the single largest TAM. So we're focusing on harvesting the opportunity at the middle and upper side where we have products that meet that audience's demand. But we now have about 300,000 of those mom-and-pops participating in marketing on our site and the growth there is huge. And right now they're marketing for free, but the numbers are staggering. It was basically zero, three years ago, now it's 300,000 people actively marketing there. So first, we're going to build participation and we're going to build - we're going to try to engage that community and create real powerful marketing channels for them. And then we'll offer them products that they can enhance their exposure. And so we can go after that $8 billion TAM at the lower-end, at the sub-5 unit area. I hope that answered the question.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, absolutely. And I guess as a follow-up to that, you guys obviously have different pricing tiers. You mentioned the smaller-end of the market pays a lot more, so would you say that's a diamond-level pricing? And how does the TAM increase as you essentially make the assumption that a lot of those people signing up, essentially, will start with standard, then move on to, like, a diamond-level package or a high-level package over time?
Andy Florance: So the - we actually - we measure it as the spend per unit. So the numbers won't be precise. But at the upper end, if someone's got a 200 unit or 300 unit community they might be spending $30 a year per unit with us. When you move down to someone who is - got a 20-unit community, they might be spending $300 a unit or $200 a unit per year. So it actually - they more pay more per unit. And so they may be paying the same amount or slightly less per property, but they're paying more per unit to market with us. And we do give them slightly lower price points to participate at the Basic, Silver, Gold level. But then the prices begin to look the same for small and big communities when you move into the diamond, the very highest exposure levels. And then for the sub-5 unit communities, we are not currently offering products targeted to them. Right now, we're looking to grow participation not to monetize it, so. But there are a number of different things that we can do to monetize that in the years to come, but right now we're focused on just getting them to use Apartments.com as their preferred marketing source.
Unidentified Analyst: And kind of final follow-up question. I imagine you've been seeing like an uplift of people on Apartments.com moving to the diamond level to get that incremental exposure, just given the number of new units being developed. How much of a tailwind would you kind of estimate that would be over the next few quarters have you seen more people probably uplift to a higher level subscription given the incremental vacancies and the new developments happening across the country?
Andy Florance: Well, I do think that these new - when you build - I think it's like 75% of all of new construction is targeted towards the top 10% of the market. So 75% of construction is targeted towards the top 10% of income renters. So those folks tend to be diamond advertisers right off the bat when they're selling the $3,000 a month unit, they're going to diamond. So that is a great tailwind for us. But the bigger tailwind would be if we get any overall growth in vacancy and apartments, that's across the whole spectrum or the whole market and that tends to drive dramatically more advertising. And I think Scott gave us some numbers, there were 75% of the revenue growth there is coming from new customers and only 25% is from coming from the folks scaling up the ladder. As the marketplace is still relatively young given that we have 10% penetration into that - into the more traditional segment of the market, and you would expect that the shift to revenue growth coming from peer - to people going up the tiers would be something you'd expect to see more ratio there in years three through ten or something from now. Right now it's about bringing new people onboard. And we're very happy with the number of folks coming on board, new advertisers. And we're getting good renewal rates with those folks, too. So it's strong.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jackson Ader: This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling this morning, guys. One question from our side. How do you think about - after we get past this initial blitz of converting LoopNet over to CoStar, how are you thinking about pricing power or potentially pricing pressure moving forward after we get through the next maybe three or four quarters?
Andy Florance: Yes, so I would say that the blitz is a - probably a ten-quarter activity. So the first phase where we did the 28,000 up-sells that occurred over three years. And I think this is a similar time period. I think this is multiple years of just bringing these folks into the CoStar information platform. The prices are actually pretty constant. And we have created - the interesting thing is, we want to make sure that there are affordable options for everybody. So we actually created some of our lowest-cost solutions to date. We came up with an enhanced CoStar property, which is a - has less content than our CoStar Suite product, it comes in at nearly half the price. So we offered something at nearly half the price. And 90% of the customers went to the high-end product. And I think that just points out the fact that they - I think this points out - we tried to do the right thing, you're like, no one wants the low-end plan. And the - it just points out that these guys make good money in the business. They spend all day long in these information products. They're able to get huge returns on their investment in these information tools. And what we're charging them is actually de minimis to what they actually make on the product. It's an investment on their part, for sure, but it's-relative to what they make on it. It's a good deal. And that is reflected in our super high renewal rates. So right now, we're focused on participation, we're not focused on trying to raise prices. We're 100% focused on participation. And we haven't contemplated anything but that.
Jackson Ader: And I guess if I can just quickly follow-up. I mean, is there any incentive - if I'm a customer who converts in October of 2017, is there any benefit that I get to converting now instead of maybe October of 2018?
Andy Florance: Excellent question. I believe we're offering, if you are a LoopNet customer, I believe, we're offering three months free, your first three months are free when you commit to a new contract. So I think it ends up being a 15-month contract with three months being free, the revenue is just straight-lined across, and that's just to give them a reason to move in 2017. But I think that you'll be able - when that is past, I think, we'll be able to continue at the same pace after that's done, just that people are smart to jump in early will get a little bit of a gift from us, a welcome gift because we appreciate their business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Lamers with William Blair.
Josh Lamers: You've touched [Technical Difficulty] into the multi-family business and better understand the contribution to growth in the quarter from asset type, call it, 2 to 50, 50 to 100 and 100-unit-plus buildings. And then, additionally, what kind of incremental sales force headcount growth might we expect in order to address the growing pipeline in that segment?
Andy Florance: Okay. I think we lost - something happened and we lost the first 10 seconds of the question. Could you repeat that?
Josh Lamers: Sure thing. Yes, I just - you've touched on it a bit, but I'd like to better understand the contribution to growth in the multi-family business from an asset-type perspective. So call it 2 to 50 units, 50 to 100, 120-plus, if you will. And then what kind of head count growth can we expect in order to meet the growing pipeline?
Andy Florance: So the - if I just generally look back at when we acquired Apartments.com, 90-some-percent of the revenue - 95% of revenue was coming from 120-units plus. Now 15% of the revenue is coming from below 100 units. So it's going from being a couple points to 15 percentage points. The growth rate in that - the growth rates in the 20 to 49 unit communities advertising has been 500% over the last three years. Growth rate in 50 to 99 communities has been 300%. Growth in 100 to 200 units is 150%. And the growth in 200-plus is 70%. So the explosive growth is at the lower end. And our first priority is to make sure our sales people are touching basically our existing clients each quarter and then they visit prospects. We do not have enough sales people to visit all of the prospects we now know that - now learned and discovered that we have in this sub-100 world. But fortunately, with the pending acquisition of ForRent, that would bring us a new shot in the arm with a growth in our sales force well over 100 people, which should give us exactly what we need to visit every one of those good prospects every quarter as we try to build out that opportunity. So we sort of have it baked in to the acquisition of ForRent to get enough salespeople to visit the prospects.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens.
Brett Huff: I guess, I got back in the queue. So I didn't mean to do that, but I can certainly ask another question. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about other new products you're going to be focusing on? I know you're going to be jamming on the LoopNet cross-sale, but I know, Andy, you've always got kind of the next thing on the horizon. Any thoughts on that at this point? Or is it just sort of too early given your focus on LoopNet right now?
Andy Florance: Sure. So we - LoopNet marketing over the next three years will look very different than LoopNet marketing looks today. So if you go back to ancient history when CoStar used to sell print office directories around the world, around this region, we actually, in the late 80s, came out with online or computer-based information products and couldn't sell them because nobody had a computer so we had to go produce magazines instead. And we - it's in our DNA. We understand how developers market higher end commercial properties, and we used to sell advertisements of $15,000 a month, $10,000 a month, $5,000 a month for these high-end properties, put them prominently in front of the biggest players in the market consistently. Compare that $5,000, $10,000 a month to the $20-some-bucks LoopNet was getting per advertiser, very different. So the biggest design change you'll see right off the bat over the next 18 months around LoopNet are creating the presentations those high-end advertisers want. What does One Bryant Tower in New York want when - Bryant Tower New York want when they are - when they've got 100,000 square feet of speculative space they need to market to the community. And we believe we can build those products in LoopNet. So that will be a big development push. The other development push that's still early stages, but you're right, I spent two days in Atlanta doing focus groups on new products this week, because we had nothing else going on. And the - and one of the things we're very excited about is doing more work around screening, prescreening renters who are setting leads in the communities and potentially providing tools to accelerate and streamline the screening process and application process with these millions of renters coming off of Apartments.com. The renters don't like the way the system currently works, it's very inefficient, they can't tell what they qualify for, they can't tell what's really available and then the owners don't like the system where they get super high bad lead ratios. And we think we can solve those problems with some innovative tools. And we think those tools will lead us into monetizing the lowest side of the market, that sub-5 unit area. So that is one of our highest priorities. We've added some staff around that, and we continue to add some staff around that and that - we've done some very small acquisitions around that area, too. So that - not going into too much detail, I think that's where we're focusing.
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue. Please go ahead.
Andy Florance: Thank you everyone for joining us. I appreciate your patience as we went through a pretty long call today and I blame Rich for that, I cut out at least ten pages that Rich wrote for me. But we look forward - we had - we were glad that we were able to report a fantastic early indication on the LoopNet-CoStar integration. It's still very early and look forward to being able to come back at the year-end call and give you some more substance, what happened over the full three-month period. So thank you very much.
Operator: And that concludes your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andy Florance: Thank you, Rich. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. We achieved an excellent first half of 2017 as our investments into the business, along with tremendous execution on all levels by the CoStar team, resulted in remarkable increases in sales and revenue growth. We have excellent momentum heading into the second half of this year. We delivered strong performances across the board as revenue in the second quarter of 2017 accelerated to $237 million, which is an increase of 15% year-over-year. For the second quarter in a row, we generated our best sales quarter in our history. Company-wide net bookings were $37 million, a 39% increase compared to the second quarter of 2016. CoStar Suite sales bookings were the strongest they've ever been, with a 23% year-over-year increase. Overall, CoStar Suite turned in solid revenue during Q2, with a growth rate of 13% year-over-year. Revenue growth in commercial property and land rose 17% year-over-year. Multifamily revenue was up 24% over the second quarter of last year. We are particularly pleased with that strong growth in the second quarter with mid-20% growth rate of Apartments.com. Apartments.com sales climbed for the third consecutive quarter as we reached our second best multifamily sales quarter. We continue to reap the rewards of our investments in our advertising campaign and strong presence at last month's National Apartment Association Conference in Atlanta. We once again set company records for both booth visits, leads captured, demos delivered and client appointments. More importantly, millions of dollars of net new sales came from this important annual event. We had an excellent quarter in commercial property and land as the sales team turned in second-best quarter of sales. We have a robust sales of LoopNet Premium Lister, tiered advertising sales to owners and excellent sales numbers from our land and business-for-sale teams. We've had a strong start to 2017 in sales as we've achieved $71 million of net bookings in the first half of the year, up 26% from the same year-to-date period in the year prior. We're clearly benefiting from the impact of our investment into our larger sales organization, which increased in size by 40% compared to the beginning of last year. The sales management team, very well led by Max Wellington [ph] is experienced and in place and helping this larger sales force to mature. We believe that maximum productivity levels are still ahead of us and that we have a huge runway of more than 100,000 clients to sell to. Forbes recently recognized our strong performance in growing revenue by naming CoStar Group to the Forbes Fast Tech 25 list. The list recognizes technology companies with the highest 3-year sales averages. The 2017 list has CoStar placed at number 16 with 29% average sales growth for the past three years. Salespeople sell best when they have excellent services to sell. We continue to deliver new services, tools and top-flight marketing websites. This includes services like CoStar Analytics, Lease/Sale Analysis and tools like the mobile app for iPhone and our iPad mobile app, CoStar Go. Great new marketplace sites like Apartamentos.com and tiered advertising on loopnet.com are also having a positive impact. We continue to look for ways to innovate and build upon our tremendous platform. As we've spoken about on our previous earning calls, we're in the process of completing an overall CoStar Suite user interface. This will include a groundbreaking new listing management tool that will allow our clients to both -- to more easily manage their listings for both CoStar and LoopNet from one simple-to-use interface. We believe this will result in faster real-time data updates and overall, better data quality. This will free up our researchers' time to focus on other valuable commercial real estate research subjects, ultimately delivering even more value to our subscribers. Innovation drives growth. We are dedicated to driving the technology revolution of commercial real estate that we began in the 1990s. And more recently, the multifamily industry by delivering world-class services and solutions for our clients and the more than 37 million unique visitors that came to our family of websites last month. As a proof point, I'm very pleased that in 2017, for the fourth year in a row, CoStar has been named in the Forbes' world's most innovative growth companies' list. Our marketing efforts in multifamily have raised consumer awareness and driven huge numbers of unique visits and total visits. Once again, we remained the clear number 1 Apartment Internet listing service based on a combination of traffic, SEM traffic, SEO, total advertised communities, leads delivered, brand recognition, leases signed and revenue. Our aggressive and effective advertising campaign continues. Our new consumer advertising campaign hit its peak media weight in the second quarter of '17. We launched a total of 10 new spots and have already run 8,400 commercials this year, reaching 90% of U.S. households and delivering 1 billion impressions. Our goal is to reach renters at home, on the go, on mobile devices, on their computers and through social media. We also ran significant ad campaigns for Apartamentos.com and Westside rentals this year. Overall, our multifamily advertising campaign has been a major success and is leading to break-away results. According to Hitwise, in June '17, when compared to Apartment Guide, rent.com and ForRent, the Apartments.com network was number 1 in visits in 96% of the top 210 U.S. local markets. This includes number 1 in markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. According to comScore, Apartments.com has been number 1 in visits for 28 months and number 1 in unique visitors for two years. In the second quarter of '17, visits and unique visitor traffic reached all-time high for Apartments as we continued to expand our lead over the competition. Adding to that success, we're pulling away from the competition according to comScore. Apartments.com unique visitors increased in each month in the second quarter of 2017 and for June, are up 32% year-over-year. Apartment Guide and rent.com unique visitors declined in each month in the second quarter and are down 12% and 17% -- 7%, respectively, year-over-year in June. We now have 25% more unique visitors than Apartment Guide and 185% more unique visitors in rent.com. In visits, our advantage is even more pronounced as our network averaged 42 million visits per month in the second quarter. In June, Apartments.com had 22 million more visits than Apartment Guide and 24 million more visits than rent.com. Apartments.com visits were up 29% year-over-year in June, while Apartment Guide was down an astonishing 37% and rent.com visits were down 11% for the same period. Interestingly, ForRent.com has moved ahead of both Apartment Guide and rent.com in visits in June of 2017. ForRent's progress is impressive. Clearly, our investments in the multifamily space over the past 2.5 years have transformed Apartments.com into a very strong business with fantastic traffic and consumer engagement, but even more impressive for our paying clients is our ability to drive quality leads that result in signed leases. That's what property managers are ultimately paying for. For June, our leads in Apartments.com are up 49% year-over-year. On-Site and LeaseHawk are two third-party providers that provide information on leads in the apartment industry. They looked at 3.7 million leads in the first 6 months of '17. LeaseHawk found that Apartments.com generate more leads than our top three competitors combined. In that same period, On-Site showed Apartments.com generate not only more leads but more importantly, more leases than our top three competitors combined. Also, On-Site show that Apartments.com is the most efficient lead source. Their data show that it took Apartment Guide 17 leads on average to generate one lease. It took ForRent 16 leads to generate one lease. It took Zillow 15 leads to generate one lease. But Apartments was, by far, the winner requiring only 9 leads to generate one lease. Since Apartments.com needs about half as many leads to result in a lease compared to RentPath and ForRent, it follows that our clients can save a lot of time, money and hassle by using Apartments.com. So we're delivering more leases and at a lower cost leasing process. During the first half of '17, we've delivered twice as many leases as Apartment Guide, 5x more leases than ForRent and 5x more leases than Zillow. Apartments.com has taken a completely different approach than our competitors have. We focus on generating informed inquiries from legitimately interested potential renters while other companies frankly design their software to generate the most leads possible as their primary scorecard. As a result of this lead spam mentality of our competitors, many apartment leasing offices have to wade through and process thousands of unnecessary, unqualified, useless leads. That costs them both real money and significant opportunity costs. Our secret shoppers contact apartment leasing officers millions of times each year. The typical apartment community, we call, only answers its leasing office phone about 30% of time. The largest property management companies don't do much better, only answering the phone about 40% of the time. Obviously, they're a little overwhelmed and they're missing many potentially highly qualified renters when they do not answer the phone. In addition, they're creating a negative customer experience, which, I think, prevents them from building a positive brand image. I think the spam mentality of many of our competitors is directly responsible for this problem. Our clients are beginning to give us credit for driving the most efficient leasing process. We think that over the course of the next few years, we can make the apartment leasing process even more efficient for both the renters and the landlords. Renters have reported that the apartment hunting process is stressful. One of their very real concerns is that once they give notice to move out of their existing apartment, they must find a new apartment quickly. And if their credit's not perfect or their income is not high enough, there is no guarantee that they will qualify for their next apartment. Two things happen to renters who are rejected at one or more apartments they apply to. First, they typically lose more than $50 and valuable time at each community they unsuccessfully apply to, depleting their limited financial resources when they would need them most. Secondly, when they're rejected, they tend to panic a little bit and dramatically accelerate the number of inquiries they put out there. This means that poorly qualified renters tend to generate many more leads than do highly qualified renters. This frustrates leasing officers and drives their costs up. Neither renter nor landlord likes this situation. It does not have to work this way. We intend to create a free premium renter service so that renters can confidentially establish their renter qualifications with Apartments.com at the beginning of their apartment search. We will collect their income and debt information, run a simple credit eviction criminal screen on them. Apartment leasing officers could confidentially enter their qualifications standards into Apartments.com. When renters search, they can see exactly which communities they prequalify for as they search. It will no longer cost them $50 each time just to learn they don't qualify. They would have the confidence and ability to find the apartments they're qualified for easily and quickly. When the leasing office receives leads from premium renters, they will see immediately that a renter is prequalified and has a very high chance of successfully completing their screening process. The leasing agents' limited time is best spent focusing on these higher probability leads. A number of our clients have indicated they would extend special offers to these highly-qualified and low-risk renters to bring them to their communities, making our premium membership even more valuable to our highly-qualified renters. More highly-qualified renters are drawn to Apartments.com and we could offer our advertisers an even greater flow of highly-qualified renters. Renters that fail to prequalify are still able to apply to a community even if they initially fail to get a positive indication on Apartments.com. In the home mortgage world, mortgages are often price adjusted for risk. This is not yet happening in the apartment world but could and perhaps should. There could be an opportunity for us here in this area as well. To help facilitate these goals, earlier this month, we acquired a California-based company called The Screening Pros. They have over 25 years of applicant screening experience, and we believe that they're an excellent fit for Apartments.com. They have been developing a prescreen tool for some time, which we plan to enhance and incorporate into Apartments.com. Their process does a soft credit inquiry on the applicants, which does not affect the applicant's credit rating like a hard inquiry does at the time of application. Data points such as, does the applicant own a -- I'm sorry, does the applicant owe a previous landlord money? Do they have past unpaid utilities? Do they have an eviction filing? Or has a judgment been rendered? And can the applicant afford the rent? All are taken into consideration. For property managers and landlords, this could make listing their apartments on Apartments.com even more valuable and allow us to win over even more apartment communities to Apartments.com. Investments in sales, technology and marketing have played an enormous role in driving top line success in CoStar, but frankly, it all begins with research. We're a research operation at our core. Our highest value proposition is the high-quality and comprehensive commercial real estate information we curate. The CoStar research team collects, investigates and analyzes the in-depth market data necessary to help clients and consumers make the best decisions and drive connections between millions of properties and the hundreds of thousands of companies that need those properties to grow their businesses. In 2016, 83% of all commercial real estate transactions involved a CoStar Group user. We believe that today, CoStar presents listings with potential deal value of about $1.5 trillion. As of June of 2017, our researchers and technology resources were presenting about 1 million available apartment rentals, making Apartments.com the most comprehensive marketing site for millions of consumers looking to find an apartment. Last year, an estimated 4 million people found their homes in Apartments.com. Back in October of '16, we announced our intention to build a new Global Research Center in Richmond, Virginia, to support our core commercial real estate research operations. I'm really amazed at how well our team has cycled up a major and very productive research center in such a very short period of time. With 600 researchers and software developers in the Richmond Center, it's now, by far, our largest center. Already, the Richmond Center is responsible for 60% of our U.S. research activity. This time last year, we were still only visiting cities to determine where to locate our new research center. So this has gone really quickly. Through our Richmond Center, we have proactively improved the way we do research. We are building new software tools to streamline the research process. We're better branding the company through our substantial communications with the commercial real estate community. We've rebuilt our training processes to better equip our researchers to do the best job they can. We've launched a new 233-person tenant research team in the Richmond Center to enhance and improve the highly-valued tenant information we provide in CoStar. Productivity has grown in all of our research centers across the U.S., as our team of over 600 professionals in Richmond are pushing the bar even higher for excellence in research. The increased amount of information we're collecting by consistently making more frequent contacts with commercial real estate professionals is having a huge positive impact on data quality. Last month, we achieved a major milestone in research when we successfully found and interviewed representatives of 80% of the active commercial real estate players in North America and United Kingdom during the course of just one month. This is a huge accomplishment we have aspired to but have never before achieved. I want to congratulate our Vice President of Research, Lisa Ruggles, and the entire research team on achieving this milestone on behalf of our hundreds of thousands of clients. There is no doubt in my mind that our investment in stronger research has been a significant factor in our sales booking growth in the first half of 2017. I want to give you a quick update on LoopNet and CoStar conversion. We're on track to integrate CoStar and LoopNet databases early this fall. As an organization, after many months of hard work and preparation, we're ready to move ahead. Our data has never been better. Our software teams have integrated the LoopNet and CoStar databases into one unit by database on the back-end. We haven't deployed it yet, but work is largely done. We have launched a B2B advertising campaign, clearly branding CoStar and LoopNet and differentiating the brands. We expect to begin notifying some customers in September of the upcoming integration. We believe this will generate meetings and sales in the fall, but the fourth quarter is expected to be the first full quarter of sales resulting from this effort. I'm just back from visiting our offices in Spain, Germany and Scotland and England and want to update you on what we have going on in Spain right now. We launched a completely new public commercial real estate website for Madrid in June at Belbex.com. Check it out. Belbex will be similar to loopnet.com. Belbex is a listing site that lets brokers and owners publish their office, retail and warehouse listings for lease or for sale in Madrid to both the brokerage community and end users. It's free to list and search as we look to expand content and build traffic. We plan to initiate advertising opportunities on the site later in the year, similar to those that you find on Apartments.com. Belbex continues to offer their legacy robust information solution on a subscription basis. Once we've collected more content, we expect to launch CoStar in Spain probably at about a year or so. We've invested this year building up our research strength in Madrid. We quadrupled the size of the research team there and launched a major field research effort. We inspected tens of thousands of properties and discovered tens of thousands of new listings we've not known about. We have nearly tripled the number of listings we present there from the beginning of the year to now. We anticipate double the number of active listings again within the year. We believe that we'll be able to offer by far the most comprehensive commercial real estate marketplace ever offered in Spain. The commercial real estate markets remain healthy, with occupancy rates at or near business cycle highs across the apartment office, industrial and retail property types. That said, as new construction deliveries have ramped up, occupancies have softened a bit in many areas. As job growth is healthy, the market can easily withstand this new construction, and these construction jobs are part of why the economy is healthy today. As this new supply hits the market, rent growth in the apartment office sectors has also slowed from cycle peaks, especially in segments exposed to new construction. At the same time, recent strong job growth bodes well for commercial leasing as a household formation that drives the apartment sector. These factors, rising supplies, day job growth, create a good situation for CoStar since we're an integral part of the leasing and marketing program for building owners and managers. In the office sector, vacancy rates were essentially stable at 10.3%, that's up slightly from 10.2% in the prior quarter but down from 10.4% a year ago, so it's flat. Completions are now outpacing the absorption for the first time since 2010. The vacancy rates are expected to inch up a touch in the near term, but still be in the healthy territory. Recent activity is in-line with our expectations with net office absorption totaling 25 million square feet over the past two quarters compared to 37 million square feet of completions. Similarly, rent growth in the office sector softened to 1.8% compared to 4.4% a year earlier, but basically in line with inflation. As we reported in prior quarters, the apartments market is normalizing and that means slightly softer occupancy rates. Effective rent growth has dropped to 2.4% from 3.7% a year earlier, and lease-up on new construction is slowing a bit. That stems partly from the 220,000 new units delivered over the past 12 months. That's a bit more than 187,000 units of net absorption. This rush of deliveries has pushed vacancy up to 5.9%, which is still right in-line with historical averages. Since apartment advertising spending is highly correlated with weaker apartment markets, a more competitive apartment market with a lot of construction is actually good news for Apartments.com ad sales. Investment sales activity declined slightly in the first half of 2017, a trend that has started in '16 and annual real estate trading volumes fell about 10% from a year earlier. Investment sales are running at about 10% above historical averages, though, of the past 10 years. I have to say, we've had an excellent first half to 2017 in all aspects of our business. Our sales success that we're able to report to you today is driven by the fact that all of our core elements for our business are performing at full speed, and we're really happy with the progress we're making. At this call -- at this point, I'm going to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy.
Andy Florance: You're welcome.
Scott Wheeler: Certainly, had a strong first quarter. Thanks for those highlights. Great to see the benefit of our investments showing up really in a big way in our results this quarter. So as Andy mentioned, the revenue in the second quarter of 2017 increased 15% over the prior year. Organically, our revenue growth rate in the second quarter was 14%. This is after normalizing for the acquisitions of WestsideRentals and LandWatch, both of which closed earlier this year and the THOMAS DAILY acquisition, which we completed in the mid-second quarter of 2016. The second quarter organic revenue growth increased from 13% in the first quarter, reflecting continued strong momentum in sales, particularly in our online marketplace businesses. Looking at our revenue performances by services. CoStar Suite revenue growth was 13% in the second quarter of 2017 versus second quarter of 2016. Because of our strong sales performance, we expect CoStar Suite growth rate to continue at 13% through 2017, which is at the upper end of the 12% to 13% range we previously discussed. Revenue growth rates in information services remain negative in the second quarter of 2017, as expected. So we continue to wind down the LoopNet information products ahead of the planned integration with CoStar Suite. The revenue decline from the LoopNet information products in the second quarter was moderated a bit by strong double-digit growth in our other information services areas, which includes portfolio strategies, real estate manager and our THOMAS DAILY operations in Europe. We've no change to our expectations, Information Services revenue will decline at low double-digit rates in the second half of the year. This will leave us with expected full year revenue and Information Services declining around 8% to 11% for the year. We had a very strong second quarter in multifamily as revenue increased 24% year-over-year and 22% on an organic basis, adjusting for the acquisition of Westside rentals in January. Approximately three quarters of the organic revenue growth is driven by the addition of new paying properties, while the remaining 25% of the growth is a result of existing customers selecting more valuable advertising packages. Revenue contribution from Westside Rentals of approximately $1 million in the quarter was not particularly material as expected. We continue to expect this will wind down as we complete the transition of WestsideRentals to the Apartments.com advertising model. Based on continued strong sales performance, we expect our full year 2017 growth for multifamily revenue to be at the top end of the 21% to 23% range we communicated previously. Rounding out our services performance, commercial property and land grew 17% year-over-year in the second quarter. Organic revenue growth, adjusting for approximately $1 million in revenue from our recent LandWatch acquisition, was 15% in the second quarter and continues to accelerate above the 11% revenue growth we reported in 2016. This improved growth rate is a result of our increased focus on selling LoopNet Premium Lister and tiered advertising to property owners. We expect this organic growth trajectory in the business to improve to a range of 13% to 16% for the full year of 2017, an increase from our previous guidance range of 12% to 14%. When we include the revenue from the acquisition of LandWatch, we expect commercial property and land services to grow in a range of 16% to 19%, which is an improvement from the 15% to 18% we discussed last quarter. On to gross margins, we came in at 77% in the second quarter, also consistent with the first quarter of 2017. We expect gross margins to remain at approximately this level for the rest of the year. The vast majority of our cost of revenues relates to our research operation, and as Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with the productivity improvements we've seen from our investment in the new research center in Richmond, Virginia. The center now houses more than 600 employees, is ahead of schedule with regards to this year's resourcing plan. Operating expenses for the second quarter of $154 million were favorable to our forecast, primarily due to the timing of our marketing spend and other investment initiatives. We expect this to reverse in the third and fourth quarters. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA of $54 million in the second quarter exceeded our guidance range by $11 million. It was only $2 million lower than the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 23% in the quarter, approximately 5% above the high end of our previous guidance range. Net income for the quarter ended June 30 was $22 million, ahead of both expectations and prior year, aided by a reduction in our effective tax rate from 40% in the second quarter 2016 to only 14% in the current quarter. This change in the effective tax rate is a result of adopting a new accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions, which we implemented at the beginning of the year. Under this new guidance, the tax benefits related to stock price appreciation on share-based payments are now recognized as an income tax expense rather than as an adjustment to stockholders equity on the balance sheet. This new accounting guidance is expected to result in increased volatility in our GAAP income tax rates from quarter-to-quarter. Cash investment balances were approximately $575 million as of June 30, 2017, just down slightly from a balance of $582 million after the first quarter. The reduction in the cash investment balance is a result of the acquisition of LandWatch and timing of income tax payments. Beginning this quarter, you'll notice we included a cash flow statement in our press release for the first time ever in response to requests from our investors. Now let's take a look at some performance metrics for the quarter. As Andy mentioned, our sales force, which totals approximately 715 sales reps, delivered an all-time high of $37 million in net bookings in the second quarter of 2017, despite continued negative net new bookings from Information Services. Certainly, a high point for the quarter. We saw strong sales performance across all three of our growing revenue sectors. We're making great progress towards our planned integration and cross-selling efforts of CoStar to LoopNet users, which we expect to commence before we talk again in the fall. Consistent with the guidance we provided previously, the cross-selling of LoopNet users to CoStar is not expected to have a material impact on our 2017 sales and revenue results. The renewal rate on annual contracts was 90.6% in the second quarter of 2017, up very slightly from the 90.5% achieved in the second quarter of 2016 and 30-basis points above the renewal rate we achieved in the first quarter of this year. The sequential increases in the renewal rate is a result of improvements in our multifamily business. The renewal rates for CoStar Suite remain strong and in-line with recent quarters. The renewal rate for customers who've been subscribers for five years or longer was 97.1%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 78% of our revenue in the quarter, up from 77% this time last year. I'll now talk through our outlook for the full year in the third quarter of 2017. Based on the strong sales and revenue performance in the second quarter, we're raising our top line outlook by $7 million at the midpoint. We now expect revenue in the range of approximately $954 million to $960 million for the year, representing an increase in the expected growth rate to 14% to 15%, up from a range of 13% to 14% communicated previously. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2017 in the range of $243 million to $245 million, representing top line year-over-year growth of around 15% at the midpoint. LandWatch is expected to contribute approximately $2 million in revenue in each of the third and the fourth quarters of this year. In terms of earnings, we're raising our guidance range for the full year 2017 to approximately $4.42 to $4.52 for non-GAAP net income per diluted share based on 32.7 million shares. This includes an increase of $0.12 per share related to the strong projected organic revenue result, substantially all of which is expected to convert to earnings. As I mentioned earlier, our second quarter EBITDA results were favorable to our published guidance ranges, partially a result of the timing of expenses for marketing and various investment initiatives. We still expect our full year 2017 investments to remain at the levels consistent with our prior outlook, although the quarterly timing has shifted somewhat. For the third quarter of 2017, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in the range of $1.09 to $1.15 and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $67 million to $70 million. Margins are expected to increase sequentially through the third and the fourth quarters. Costs associated with the Xceligent litigation were approximately $3 million in the second quarter, and we continue to expect costs in a range of $10 million to $20 million for the year. Our guidance range for this litigation has not changed from what we communicated previously and includes $15 million in legal costs for the year and $5 million in the third quarter related to this matter. Overall, I'm very pleased with our sales performance and the success of our investment programs in the second quarter 2017, and we remain on track to reach our stated goal of achieving a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018. With that, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens.
Brett Huff: My question is on Spain. This sounds like the first sort of major ramping up of investment following, I think, you guys did a small inorganic deal and kind of thrown some effort behind that. It seems like it is both a LoopNet-like expansion as well as a curated research-type expansion. Can you kind of walk us through, if that's true? And if this is going to be a model - if Madrid is going to be a model for other cities across Europe? And give us a tenure for that kind of investment?
Andy Florance: Sure. So from your perspective in terms of any impact in next two to three years, I think the impact is de minimus on our EBITDA expansion. So it might involve the addition of 20, 25 staff something like that for Madrid. But what we're doing is, it's a robust and significant market. There is, in our mind, no material competition. There is a huge opportunity. It's a trillion dollar economy. And the market needs information on what's happening in commercial real estate. The brokerage firms there don't have as big a presence as they do in other countries. I mean, they're there, but they're not as prevalent, don't have the same market penetration. So what we've seen is that the owners there are bigger drivers of what's happening in the market. And that's true in Germany as well. So we think there is a lot of potential to sell advertising to owners who take real pride in their properties and are more motivated to spend marketing dollars to try to bring in tenants. We will - we think it's also less expensive from a sales and marketing perspective, if we start with just generating - a marketplace, generate a lot of eyeballs that drives content. And then, as we watch the content grow and the buyers will see the marketplace grow over the course of a couple of years, we'll build up analytic histories that are quite valuable, and we'll build up those research relationships, and then, we'll migrate into a CoStar platform. So it's something that we'll - we're going to watch it here in Spain. And if it goes the way we want it to, we'll use that model in other markets. I think it makes sense, and - I think in the first three or four months - three months of Belbex, we got a 0.25 million visits to the sites. So actually, it's working well. We're getting some good traffic there so - and I also believe, we're now the #1 information source for - we're the best information for Madrid and that will be worth something at some point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: So one question. I was really trying to decide whether to ask about revenue or the safe harbor statement. So I think I'm going to go with the revenue.
Andy Florance: Well, thank you for asking about our safe harbor statements first up because, as you noticed the Beatles references, Bill.
Bill Warmington: Well, the - so I wanted to ask my question about the conversion up-sell and how that's going to work? Meaning that, of the 715 sales reps, how many of those are actually going to be working on the leads? How many leads are they going to get each month? What kind of close rates should we think about? And how long does it take for the bookings to basically flow through?
Andy Florance: I would - I'll give you some general guidelines, you know, plus or minus. But the - it will really be the focus of the CoStar field sales team, the customer relationship managers and the inside CoStar sales team. So that is roughly a little more than half of the sales force, 350, 375, something like that. And initially, we will not give them the better leads. We'll - we will target some of the - unfortunately, one of the - I won't name the company, but one of the best prospects I was the most excited about converting signed up last month and so I didn't even get to move them through the ringer. So - but we're not going to give them the best - I mean, I'm actually very excited about it, but it was supposed to happen during the integration process. But the - we're going to initially give the salespeople about ten leads per month per rep - ten leads per rep. And then we'll gauge how effectively they work those. The leads are - these leads are pretty valuable, and we want to give them time to work them properly. There is no rush. There's nothing about these two months versus those six months or this year. We want to do it properly, want to handle our communications with them well, answer their questions, move them into process - move them through the process at the right pace. But right now, it feels like about ten per month per rep and I think - and then we might pick that up a little bit. We will again start with the intermediate priority ones and then we'll - later in the year, we'll ramp up to the higher priority ones and into 2018, we'll approach the higher priority ones. Was there another component to that question?
Bill Warmington: Bookings effect?
Andy Florance: Bookings effect. Yes, so probably more material in the fourth quarter, first, second, third quarter of next year.
Scott Wheeler: And we haven't assumed a significant amount of bookings in this year, Bill, in our outlook.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Dobell from William Blair.
Brandon Dobell: As we think about the progression of net new through the balance of the year, maybe some color around the puts and takes versus last year? As well as how some of these - as a lot of efforts going on here on a lot of different products, how those are going to flow through into it, the balance of this year?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, so when you look at the strength we've seen in the second quarter, obviously, we've got a great quarter in CoStar and multifamily, strong. And commercial property and land is very strong as well. We expect those trends to continue into the second half of the year. We'll have a seasonality that will decline a little bit in multifamily as the rental season declines, but that's difficult every other year. When we talk about the LoopNet CoStar integration, as that thing starts to come on board, we should see more bookings move into the CoStar Suite factor of the business and decline faster in the info services component. But that's - there'll be a net wash over time as those come along. And then really in commercial property and land, like I mentioned, we expect that to continue strong for the rest of the year, and we're focusing a lot on adding sales force there on the sales-to-owners, we're seeing that become very effective. So that mid- to high double-digit rate that we're going now, we expect that to be sustainable as we go forward with commercial property and land. Any other color, Andy, you want to add to that?
Andy Florance: I think that covers it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.
Jackson Ader: This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling. Question from our side. How much of the shift in OpEx - and I guess, more specifically the sales and marketing expenses - were directly due to the pushing out of the LoopNet integration versus maybe some other factors?
Andy Florance: I'll take a shot at it. But I think it's nominal. I just checked with the CMO this morning and I think we pushed $1.3 million of marketing expenses over the quarter with CoStar [mill] at $2.7 million. So it's $1 million or $2 million pushed into the next quarter. So it's not that much.
Scott Wheeler: We also had some - in the launch of Belbex, we had some marketing in the second quarter for that, which we decided to actually save and spend a little later in the year. And then, we also had such favorable results in Apartments that some of our SEM spend, we decided to save a little bit for the next part of the year. And so those were a couple other small components giving us about $4 million favorable in total in the quarter that we'll expect to spend later in the year. I once heard a wise saying from my son, Abe, says, "Dad, you are really aggressive accountant, but you got to save some stuff for the second half though. Please hold back and be ready to spend as something comes up." I listen, sometimes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen from Citigroup.
Peter Christiansen: Thanks for the cash flow statement. I appreciate that.
Andy Florance: Somebody noticed, and you're welcome.
Peter Christiansen: So two things real quick. I think you called out 25% of the multifamily growth was attributed by existing customers. Any sense if that's pricing or lifting volume or vacancy rate kind of related or not? And then, my follow-up would be in the last quarter, I guess, multifamily kind of just started to break even, I was just wondering if you could comment on the trajectory of profitability there if the trend is continuing?
Andy Florance: I think a big part of that 25% is basically people who are looking for more lead flow or pushing their ad priority up higher, so they're going from a gold ad up to a platinum ad or diamond ad. So that's something - that's - a nice thing about that business is people are constantly cycling up, looking for - the more ads we sell, the more firms that need higher lead flow, need to spend more to be more prominently featured on our site. So I think that's the single biggest driver of that. And I guess - and that could be related to some vacancy growth. And then the second part of the question is...
Scott Wheeler: What was second part of the question?
Peter Christiansen: Multifamily profitability?
Scott Wheeler: Yes, multifamily profitability. We mentioned in the last quarter that we swung the profitability in multifamily and when we've moved in that business, it moves a material amount, so we're in double-digit profitability is expected in the multifamily business already by the second half of this year. So it really does swing quickly once we move into that territory. So we expect that to continue in the second quarter when we spend a bulk of our marketing, obviously, that dips down but for the rest of the year, we expect it to be pretty strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey: So it sounds to me like the investment you've made in research is really paying off in a meaningful way. I wonder, Andy, if you could comment a little bit on sort of the next step is? I heard your world-class IR guy, Rich, tell it, in terms of allowing brokers to perhaps begin entering some of their own data into maybe a combined CoStar LoopNet front-end, enhancing or maybe in some ways outsourcing the research gathering function. Does that provide potential scale, revenue growth opportunities? I'm going to be just kind of frame that out for us.
Andy Florance: Sure. So what's happening here is, for the - in the fall, for the first time, people will be able to - brokers, owners will be able to edit some of their information on our system directly. So if they want to change their rent, put a new suite on, they will do it directly. It's really going to be something that's available to known listers, people that we know who they are and we know that they're legitimate. As they do that, we think they'll be at the positive customer relationship benefit because very often they wanted to do like, make a simple quick change themselves, they don't want to have to have a conversation with the researcher. At the same time, focus group after focus group, lots of market research says that the industry really wants those researchers curating that data and being aware of what is being placed out there and making sure it accurately reflects and positions their properties to their prospective customers. So there will be a combined role there. We think it will allow us to accelerate the velocity of data through our system. It will be a little bit of a learning process because we're going to have to learn how we interact with those brokers. As we're doing some of the research, they're doing some of the input. But it creates the opportunity to reduce our research costs, accelerate our update frequencies and quality of our data. I think it - but I think the biggest impact will just be improved data and faster response times. And I think that's going to be a pretty positive thing. I think it will have more positive impact than we're prepared to talk about now because we just want to know more about any unknowns before we start counting the benefits real loudly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities.
Pat Walravens: Great and congratulations on the new bookings, guys. Can I ask about this Xceligent litigation? And I know there is going to be some real limits on what you can say given that it's live, but how long will this level of spending go on? And then, maybe, Andy, at a high level, why is it so important that you're willing to spend this kind of money?
Andy Florance: I am so excited to answer that question. I'm going to turn that over to Jon Coleman, our General Counsel.
Jon Coleman: Thank you, Andy.
Andy Florance: You're welcome, John.
Jon Coleman: So the case is ongoing. It's at the relatively early stages. We're about seven months in. And we don't have - beyond 2017, we don't - are not really giving any information on the budget, but - I mean, we expect - we don't have a trial date, and we expect it to go well into 2018. So we expect the spend to continue as it's been going. And what was the other part of the question?
Pat Walravens: So why is it important that you're willing to do that?
Jon Coleman: Well, I mean, we think it's extremely important to protect our intellectual property, and we think it's just not fair that Xceligent has - we have evidence that we think demonstrates that they've been stealing our content on an industrial scale. We believe when we filed the lawsuit that we had extremely strong evidence that, that was occurring and that evidence has only gotten stronger as we've gone forward. As for the counterclaims that they filed, we think that they are smokescreen and an entirely predictable reaction to our lawsuit. We think that they're extremely weak and have absolutely no merit. If anything, we think their recent filing is more of an admission of guilt that helps our case as opposed to anything else. So the update on the Xceligent case is that we very much look forward to proving our claims in court.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Crawford from B. Riley.
Sameet Sinha: This is Sameet on for Mike. So a quick question on the - and thanks for the statement of cash flow. A quick question on M&A. I think it looks like from your statement of cash flow that you provided, you spent about $30 million on acquisitions in Q2, which I'm guessing is for LandWatch. I know it's still pretty early, but you could talk about how that acquisition has been going so far? And part two of the question is, given that you have $574 million cash in the balance sheet right now, like what's the view on potential future M&A?
Andy Florance: Sure. So LandWatch is still - so first of all, is it just LandWatch, it's also...
Sameet Sinha: Just LandWatch?
Andy Florance: Yes, so it's still early, but we're basically executing on the business plan we had laid out prior to the acquisition of LandWatch, which is integrated in the two platforms, rationalizing where the staff is and how many folks we have. Our goal is to eventually flow all the content of all these various sites into a new URL that we own, land.com. But at this point, we think we're capturing about 57% of the search traffic on the Internet around that land in real land space of those companies that are actually engaged in that. So this gives a real strong market position. And again, it's two months in, but it's going well and going as expected. So it's an exciting beginning for us. In terms of the balance sheet and other M&A activity in potential, there - there remains an awful lot of opportunities out there. We are, at any given point, looking at a dozen companies and looking at potential combinations that will move our platforms forward, either giving us more scale in one of our core areas or a parallel area where we think we would be competitively advantaged because the assets we have in information, our sales force or software. So there is a lot out there, and it's good to have a strong balance sheet, so we can approach those opportunities and be constantly ready to move for the right acquisition. But we are cheap we're looking for good values.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
Andy Florance: Well, thank you very much for joining us for the second quarter earnings call, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the third quarter. And again, congratulations to the sales team on a fantastic acceleration in sales bookings and to our research management team for quadrupling the number of contacts with our customers year-to-date. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Time permitting, you could always requeue. And this time I would now like to turn call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Rich. That was some riveting content. I'm sure our listeners will be talking about it for days. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. We have got some numbers to report to you today. Revenue in the first quarter of 2017 was $227 million, up 13% versus the first quarter of last year. Brexit had an unfavorable foreign currency impact on our revenue growth, and if excluded our revenues were up 14% year-over-year in local currencies. Our flagship product, CoStar Suite turned in solid organic revenue growth of 13% year-over-year. Multifamily revenue was up 22% over the first quarter of last year. Revenue growth in commercial property and land accelerated to 13% year-over-year. With all of our key growth drivers turning in very strong results, we accelerated to our best quarterly sales bookings ever. Net new bookings rose 18% from the prior quarter to $35 million in the first quarter. Our sales team has now reached 718 strong, up 40% from the first quarter last year. The commercial property and rural land advertising sales teams have seen the most dramatic growth in the past year. Those sales teams now have 135 sales professionals, up 73% from a year ago. As a result, the commercial property and land sales bookings number increased 77% year-over-year to reach $7.3 million in the quarter. Sales bookings for the quarter in Europe and Canada increased 67% year-over-year to $1.2 million. We added 81 customer relationship managers this past year. Our investment in CRMs is creating more time for our field sales team to hunt for new sales and cultivate clients with the most upside potential. Our relationship managers are aggressively meeting with our existing clients and have reached 36,000 clients this past year. These visits are directly resulting in more usage of our services. For example, we have seen a 24% increase in the creation of lease analysis models after training, and clients produced 13,000 more market analytics reports in the quarter. More usage is great for renewals. This new group of CRMs will play a key role in cross-selling LoopNet to CoStar clients and CoStar to LoopNet clients. When we acquired Apartments.com, we introduced a new tiered advertising plan that has been very successful in driving revenue growth. We offer silver, gold, platinum and diamond ad levels. The advertisement sort by their ad level and the ad level also determines the size of the ad along with various other advantages. Diamond ads receive orders of magnitude more exposure than do silver ads. Accordingly, a diamond ad might cost five times what a silver ad costs.  We recently introduced tiered advertising pricing for advertisers listing properties on LoopNet. The early returns are in and they are really quite good. In the first quarter of 2017 we generated approximately 3 million of net new bookings from tiered ads on LoopNet. In the first quarter 2017, our family of websites drew an all time high of 33 million average monthly unique visitors. That is up 24% from the prior quarter, and that is more than triple the traffic we were drawing just three years ago. Our investments in the multifamily space over the past 2.5 years have transformed Apartments.com into a very strong business with fantastic traffic. The competition is reeling and we are capitalizing as we continue to generate more revenue and take more share in multifamily advertising than any other competitor. Our annual multifamily revenue run rate is now approximately $260 million. We believe we are the clear number one apartment Internet listing service based on a combination of traffic, SEM traffic, SEO, total advertised communities, leads delivered, brand recognition and revenue. In the first quarter of 2017, visits and unique visitor traffic reached all-time highs for Apartments.com and our multifamily network as we continue to expand our lead over the competition. We increased visits 26% year-over-year in the first quarter to nearly 42 million average monthly visits. For the Apartments.com network, average monthly unique visitors increased 21% year-over-year to 23 million. According to comScore, Apartments.com has been number one in visits for 25 months and unique visitors for 21 months. We are beginning our third consecutive year of our major national Apartments.com marketing campaign; our investment in these three years well exceeds $300 million. We have been highly successful in building a nationally recognized brand with this investment and you can see the traffic results. As we begin the 2017 campaign, we feel we are going to get more value for the same advertising dollars. We are getting more efficient. We plan to run approximately 10,000 TV spots along with major digital campaigns and aggressive SEM campaign. We expect to run nearly twice the number of commercials we ran last year, spending roughly the same dollars. We are also planning to continue to advertise on major TV networks for 20 weeks in 2017 compared to 14 weeks in 2016.  In 2017, we expect to reach 90% of US households, delivering over 5 billion impressions. Recently we commissioned an independent third-party research firm to conduct a survey of 500 property managers and advertising decision-makers involved in marketing apartment properties. This survey revealed a number of positive figures. When asked to list the top of mind listing services on an unaided survey, two thirds of property managers named Apartments.com as the place to advertise their apartments for rent.  At 66% we had the highest unaided awareness of all the apartment marketing websites. We had risen from 54% in the prior year to 66%. At 66%, our unaided awareness score was higher Apartment Guide’s 38%, For Rent 31%, craigslist 38%, and Zillow’s 29%. Our score as the most effective site was the highest, nearly twice the second highest score and more than five times the fifth placed site score. Our net promoter score from property managers tripled from last year to a score of positive 30. Every other competitor had a negative net promoter score, and most of them were double-digit negative. Final proof that our ad campaign is driving B2B awareness is measured by the fact that nearly 70% of the property managers surveyed knew our slogan, Change Your Apartment, Change the World. In February 2017, we launched Apartamentos.com, a professional Spanish language version of Apartments.com. We initiated a national TV campaign to promote the site on Telemundo and Univision, combined with local TV in primetime in the top 10 Hispanic markets running over 50 spots per week. We have also used digital channels including social media, display and retargeting ads in SEM support. We have also benefited from very positive coverage in the major Latino media. So far the site has received over 1 million visits and 5 million property views. As of April 17, 2017 in the top 30 Hispanic markets in the United States, we moved into the number one search position for organic searches on Google using the keyword Apartamentos. This is another value add that we are offering our clients and it is great news for the 32 million Hispanics who rent in the United States, and who make up approximately 20% of the US rental market. The client reaction to our Spanish site has been very positive. Since closing on our acquisition of Westside Rentals in Southern California in January 31, we have added all of the Westside Rentals availabilities to Apartments.com making this site even more comprehensive and valuable to renters searching our site in Los Angeles. Conversely paid advertising from Apartments.com is being displayed on the Westside rentals site. Organic Westside Rentals listings are up sharply by 25% since we closed the deal, and up over 100% including the Apartments.com listings. Our primary objective is to increase our share of rental traffic in the valuable Southern California market. The Los Angeles market is the largest apartment market in the country based on either searcher traffic or the number of apartment buildings. Since we closed the acquisition, we have seen visits to Apartments.com from Los Angeles climb over 46%, which is almost twice the growth pace of Apartments.com in the rest of the US. Finally I can share with you today a piece of news that illustrates the transformative impact of Apartments.com on our business. For the first time in 31 years as of the first quarter of this year, our single largest client is no longer a commercial real estate brokerage firm. Our new largest client is a leading apartment owner property manager. None of these leading clients is individually more than 2% of our revenues. As we stated previously, we continue to make significant investments in building even higher quality content and analytics in CoStar to capture greater market share and support the LoopNet, CoStar cross-selling activity we are expecting to focus on later this year. First over the past year and a half we have dramatically improved and expanded our analytic capabilities. We have added 40 new analysts to attract analyze and write sub-market and market reports. This team is doing a great job and has enabled us to increase the number of written market analyst reports from 1,250 to 2,400. So it basically doubled. We have moved from quarterly updates of market conditions to daily updates with all reports and forecasts updated every day to reflect the latest market conditions. We have decreased the amount of time it takes to produce our 18,000 forecasts from three weeks down to three days. We have also decreased the amount of time it takes to update our market reports from six weeks to a few hours. We have gone from producing historical apartment data in quarterly increments to daily increments. We have engineered a same-store rent series that allows us to report true rent growth versus changes in rents that could be due to changes in the mix of what is being reported. Finally we are now harnessing the billions of user searches we have to define via collaborative filtering, which buildings are truly competitive with one and another. Our white paper on same-store rent series and collaborative filtering was recognized by the American Real Estate Society as a best paper this year. Our authors of the paper were also recognized for the Association’s [Scholar Practitioner Prize].  We expanded our research operations by opening our new global research headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, on December 1, just five months ago. We expected that it would take us 18 months to take this center to 500 staff. To a tremendous team effort, we have reached that level one year ahead of plan. Richmond is now one of our top performing centers and one of our largest centers, and is making a major contribution to building the highest quality CoStar products possible. The esprit de corps, enthusiasm and morale enrichment is very strong. I firmly believe that this center will be pivotal to our success in capturing the full potential we have to up sell LoopNet information users to CoStar information services. We now have 1068 researchers supporting the CoStar product, up from 701 staff and 50 contractors back in December of 2015. The 304 additional headcount give us the capabilities we need to convert the LoopNet database, improve our data quality, increase our update frequency and improve our tenant tracking databases. More importantly, our productivity gains in the past year are remarkable. We are conducting a 144% more direct broker interviews than we were back in December of 2015. The average researcher is conducting 122% more daily interviews than in the prior time period. This means we are cycling and updating our massive property database at three times the frequency we were in December of 2015. More importantly – much more importantly, we are capturing 172% more new listings a month in aggregate than we were at the end of 2015. This translates to hundreds of billions of dollars of additional potential deal value to our clients. So we are creating real value in the product that we believe we will be able to monetize. The establishment of our Richmond center is enabling us to build a much more accurate, comprehensive and timely database of tenants in the market occupying commercial space. This information is valuable to people analyzing market demand drivers to owners looking for tenants to lease their buildings, and brokers looking for new clients. We have replaced our outsourced contract tenant researchers with 178 full-time employee staff in Richmond. Our in-house team is collecting broader data, but more importantly they're on pace to interview and verify 2.8 million tenants in a year. This is an increase of 240% over what the outsourced team had produced. I firmly believe that we have never had better content quality than we do right now. We are going to continue to improve, but I'm very happy with the progress we have made. You can imagine how hard those researchers worked to cycle these massive databases, and I want to give them a big thank you – a big thank you goes out to the best research team in the world. Our software teams are working hard to integrate the LoopNet and CoStar databases into one unified database on the back-end. That work is going really well. We recently launched a new iPhone mobile app for CoStar in the first quarter this year, and 16% of our users have already downloaded the new app. Brokers are raving about the new app. We plan a similar release for android in the second quarter of 2017. We are about to initiate our planned LoopNet information to CoStar conversion. I estimate that we will begin the main cross-selling effort late in the summer or early fall. We remain confident about this pacing and have a detailed go to market strategy in place, including a combination of in-product marketing, in-product result comparisons, retargeting, direct mail and direct sales. I believe the opportunity to sell CoStar information to LoopNet only clients along with the opportunity to sell LoopNet marketing to CoStar only clients is massive. Today only 18% of the CoStar client base is utilizing LoopNet’s industry-leading marketing service premium lister. Conversely, only 26% of LoopNet’s paying client-base is subscribing to CoStar’s industry-leading information service. This means there are 153,000 cross-selling opportunities within our client base. In addition, there are hundreds of thousands of prospects that use LoopNet without paying anything for the service that we can prospect as well. We believe that there is a revenue opportunity of hundreds of millions of dollars here. That is why we are investing so much time, effort and money into building up the quality of our content to improve our capture of this opportunity. We feel we have one solid crack at it and we want to make sure we do it right. I am proud that we could report a 32% year-over-year increase in net income while at the same time making such significant investments in our sales force, our research team and our continued marketing blitz. Rural land is a multi-trillion dollar real estate asset class in the United States. It is actually about 95% of the country. CoStar currently owns and operates two of the leading for sale sites in this space, LandsofAmerica.com and LandandFarm.com. We believe this is a huge area with lots of future potential and we are taking steps to increase our leadership position. Earlier this month, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire LandWatch, another top online leader in marketing rural properties and land for sale, including hunting land, timberland, farms and ranches. The acquisition of LandWatch solidifies our position as the number one online network of marketplaces for rural real estate as we believe the addition of LandWatch will nearly double the scale of our existing land marketplace business in terms of revenue, leads and SEO footprint. The deal is expected to close in May of 2017. In fact, I am so excited about the potential for these land businesses, for these farm businesses that I in fact went out and bought a farm. Why? I don’t know. Have been looking at too many farms in our land business. Once again, we have recently successfully defended our intellectual property and have prevailed against theft of our data. As we previously announced at the end of March, we obtained a permanent injunction in litigation against Apartment Hunters. The judge ordered Apartment Hunters, which owns apartmenthunters.com to pay damages of $10,000 per stolen listing and $10,000 per infringed image for a total of $760,000, which we have now received. The courts continue to come down pretty harshly on data stealers. A couple of weeks ago Craigslist, I would say justifiably, a couple of weeks ago Craigslist won a $60 million judgment against RadPad in a copyright and breach of contract suite with Craigslist, alleging unlawful collection of Craigslist’s apartment data by RadPad and its third party agents. RadPad had hired scrappers in India to harvest listings and contact data from Craigslist. After litigation began, RadPad wound up ceasing operations. We believe that there are similarities with cases we are involved in. You will recall we are suing Xceligenet because we have uncovered tens of thousands of instances of their copyright infringement of our content. We have also brought suite against its agent MaxVal in India, and its agent Avion in the Philippines. We have collected more than a 100 TB of evidence in connection with the case, which we believe significantly strengthens our case against them. We believe that the evidence clearly shows that Xceligenet and its agents willfully and illegally stole massive volumes of valuable content from CoStar and LoopNet. When faced with industrial scale theft of our content we take all reasonable steps to protect our shareholders and clients’ interest. We anticipate incurring significant costs in connection with this litigation over the course of the next two years. We believe it is a vital and prudent investment. The commercial real estate markets are at a healthy level with strong occupancy rates across the apartment, office, industrial and retail property types. That said, new construction is on the rise and it is beginning to make an impact on property market fundamentals in the apartment sector and office markets. Also recent job growth has been strong, which bodes well for commercial leasing activity as well as the apartment household formation that drives the apartment sector. Fortunately, CoStar is an integral part of the leasing and marketing program for building owners and managers. Therefore the combination of a healthy economy and the need to lease space is good situation for us. In the office sector, vacancy rates were essentially stable at 10.3%, up slightly from 10.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016 with absorption of 10 million square feet. This level of office leasing was lower than the previous three quarters, which may stem from the fact that some of the companies have pushed off leasing decisions until after the presidential election. At 19 million square feet, deliveries of new space for hire with an average of 15 million over the previous four quarters. That makes sense as many markets now have rents that support new construction activity. With the rise of construction, rent growth has slowed to 2.3% from market cycle peak near the 5% level in most of 2015. So we are tracking around inflation now. As we reported in prior quarters, apartment markets are showing signs of becoming increasingly competitive, effective rent growth has dropped to 2.3% from 4.4% a year earlier, and lease up on new construction is slowing somewhat. The slowdown stems partly from the 225,000 new units delivering over the past 12 months, which is 50% more than the ten-year historical average making apartments the only real estate sector in which construction is outpacing the short-term historical supply. The supply numbers we are seeing now are well below supply levels we saw in the 60s and 70s. And there is also a little bit of bifurcation there, where there is an abundance of supply in the upper end of the market and a real shortage in the lower end. Fundamentally, when you look at household formation and new home deliveries and new apartment construction, we have a housing shortage if anything. The rush of deliveries has pushed vacancies up from 6.1% to 5.6% a year earlier, since increased apartment advertising, spending is highly correlated with weaker apartment markets, a more competitive apartment market would be very good news for Apartments.com to add sales. Investment sales activity declined slightly in the first quarter, reflecting a trend that started in 2016 with annual real estate trading volumes down about 10% from a year earlier. Investment sales activity is still at a high level compared to long-term average about 40% above the average of the past 10 years. We are off to a tremendous start in 2017 in all aspects of our business. We remain committed to reaching $1 billion in revenue as we [reach] 2018, Scott might say, for the year, and reaching our 40% target margin numbers. But to give you more color and detail on this, I'm going to turn the call over to our ever confident CFO, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Thank you, Andy. It seems like that farm purchase has really got you confident.
Andrew Florance: You got to be committed to your business. You've got to be committed. I'm a farmer now.
Scott Wheeler: We can't wait to see it. So we certainly had a strong start to 2017 and we are definitely excited about the trajectory of the business as we go into the year.  As Andy mentioned, the revenue for the first quarter increased 13% over the prior year, 14% excluding the impact of foreign currency movements. Sequentially our revenue increased $8 million in Q1 versus the fourth quarter of 2016 fueled by our strong multifamily sales results in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2017. This compares to an average sequential quarterly increase of $6 million for the year in 2016. Looking at our revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue grew 13% in the first quarter of 2017 versus the first quarter of 2016 and 14% on a constant currency basis. As we previously discussed, we expect CoStar Suite growth rates to continue within a 12% to 13% range throughout 2017.  Revenue growth rates in the information services sector remained negative in the first quarter of 2017 as expected as we continue to wind down the LoopNet information products ahead of the planned integration with CoStar Suite. We expect information services revenue to decline at mid to high single-digit rates in the second quarter of 2017, and in the low double-digit rates in the second half of the year. We expect full-year revenue in information services to decline in the 9% to 11% range as we communicated in February. We had a great first quarter in multifamily, as revenue increased 22% year-over-year. This is consistent with our 2016 full year pro forma growth and is at the high-end of our guidance range. Revenue contributions from Westside Rentals of approximately $0.5 million in the quarter was not material as expected, and this will wind down as we complete the transition of Westside Rentals to the Apartments.com advertising model. Based on our very strong sales performance, we are raising our full year 2017 growth expectations for multifamily revenue to a range of 21% to 23%, up 100 basis points from our previous guidance.  Rounding out our service performance, commercial property and land grew 13% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2017, which is an increase above the 11% revenue growth we reported in the full year and in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improved growth rate is a result of our investment in additional sales resources that Andy mentioned, and they are focused on selling our LoopNet premium lister and our tiered advertising products to property owners. We expect the growth trajectory in this business to continue to accelerate organically to a range of 12% to 14% for the full year of 2017, an increase from our previous guidance range of 10% to 12%. When we include the revenue from the pending acquisition of LandWatch, we expect the commercial property and land sector to now grow in a range of 15% to 18% for the year. Our gross margin came in at 77% in the first quarter down from 79% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and slightly above our expectations. The vast majority of our cost of revenues relates to our research operations, which we continue to expand with our new research center in Richmond, Virginia. The improvements in our research performance have been impressive, and we expect to reach our research staffing goals by the end of the second quarter. Accordingly, we expect gross margins to moderate in 2017, within the 75% to 78% range that we communicated previously as we scale up our team in Richmond.  Operating expenses for the first quarter were in-line with our expectations and reflect the continued investments we are making in the business. This includes the cost of our expanded sales force, additional technology resources focused both on our products and research processes, and the addition of operating costs for Westside Rentals.  Now, let's take a look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. As Andy mentioned, our sales force delivered $35 million in net bookings in the first quarter of 2017 despite continued negative net bookings from information services. We are making great progress towards our planned integration and cross sell efforts of LoopNet and CoStar, which we expect to commence in late summer or early fall. Consistent with the guidance we provided in February, the cross-selling of LoopNet users to CoStar is not expected to have a material impact on our 2017 sales and revenue results, but represents a huge opportunity for the business going forward. The renewal rates on annual contracts was 90.3% in the first quarter of 2017. This was up slightly from the 90.1% in the first quarter of 2016, and 10 basis points below the renewal rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect the renewal rates to moderate slightly in future periods due to the increased scale of our multifamily products, which currently have a lower renewal rate as compared to CoStar Suite contracts. The renewal rates for CoStar Suite remain strong, and continue to perform at a high 93% to 94% rate, very consistent over time. The renewal rate for customers who have been subscribers for five years or longer was an impressive 97.4%. Subscription revenue on annual contracts accounts for 78% of our revenue in the quarter and this is up from 74% at this time last year.  I'll now discuss our outlook for the full year and the second quarter of 2017. Based on the strong sales and revenue performance in the first quarter, along with the expected LandWatch acquisition, we are raising our top line outlook by $10 million. We now expect revenue in the range of approximately $945 million to $955 million for the year, representing an increase in the expected growth rate to 13% to 14%. This revised outlook includes an organic revenue increase of $5 million and an increase of approximately $5 million in revenue associated with the expected LandWatch acquisition. Our guidance estimates assume the acquisition closes in May. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2017 in the range of $233 million to $235 million, representing top line growth of around 13% at the midpoint. This outlook includes approximately $1 million of LandWatch revenue for a partial quarter. In terms of earnings, we are raising our guidance range for the full year 2017 to approximately $4.30 to $4.40 for non-GAAP net income per diluted share. This is based on 32.7 million shares. This includes an increase of $0.10 per share related to the strong organic revenue increase, substantially all of which is converting to earnings. Also included in the increase is an additional $0.02 per share for the expected LandWatch acquisition.  For the second quarter of 2017, we expect non-GAAP net income per share in a range $0.58 to $0.64, and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $40 million to $43 million. We expect the second quarter to be low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year, as we increase our marketing spend for the start of the peak apartment rental season. As in prior years, our marketing spend fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, and we expect total marketing cost for the year to be in line with the guidance we gave in February, and similar to our marketing spend in 2016. Margins are expected to increase sequentially through the third and fourth quarters and we expect to exit 2017 with adjusted EBITDA margins above 35%, and above the Q4 2016 margins. Costs associated with the Xceligent litigation were approximately $3 million in the first quarter. We continue to expect costs in a range of $10 million to $20 million for the year. Our guidance ranges have not changed from what we communicated in February, and it includes $15 million in legal costs for the year and $4 million in the second quarter related to this matter. Overall, I'm very pleased with the pace of our sales improvements and the success of our investment programs in the first quarter of 2017. We certainly remain on track to reach our stated goal of achieving a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018.  With that I will now open the call to questions and start searching for my own farm.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: Good morning everyone.
Andrew Florance: Good morning Bill.
Scott Wheeler: Hi Bill.
Bill Warmington: So, from my one question I wanted to ask about the apartment market, in two parts, the first being you had this theory that the slower apartment market would be positive for advertising and I wanted to see whether you actually were seeing a pick up in spend as vacancies go up. And the second was, you are sitting on almost $600 million in cash, are you thinking about deploying it into the apartment market?
Andrew Florance: Can you say it one more time? The first one Bill, I think keeping it all in context, so yes, we see correlation. We have looked at it in different ways and we have seen correlation where when occupancies are weak in apartments, people spend more to market them. What they are spending to market their apartment communities is de minimis relative to the value [Indiscernible] and you need to keep those occupancy levels in order to make your mortgage commitments and you will be pretty aggressive to make sure you drive lead flow in a soft market. So, we do feel there is a correlation. However, putting this in context over the last 30 years the apartment market is still very, very robust. The vacancy levels we are talking about now are very low. They are well below long-term averages, and I actually think that we bring new inventory in at the top of the market, then it filters down to the lower income units over time. And the rates at the lower income end of the market are climbing at 5% year-over-year right now, and the vacancy rates, they are very, very low. So I think that we are also – I think we are delivering about 0.6 housing units across a single home and multifamily right now for every household formed. So I think we are still in a pretty significant housing shortage overall. So, while you see some softening, it is really de minimis. In terms of our belief if there is more value for us in the multifamily industry? Absolutely. We are thinking we are at the very beginning of this opportunity and we have made some investments. We think they have paid off. We do have $600 million in cash and we would look for ways to take advantage of our strong market position, enhance that position, add more value on top of that or solidify it. And it is something we keep an eye on.
Operator: And our next question in the queue will come from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question.
Andrew Florance: Good morning Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: It sounds Andy, like you are pretty bold up and rightly so on the returns you think you can get from the Richmond Research Center and the investments you have made there. Could you just talk a little bit about sort of whether or not we have seen any of those benefits to date in bookings. I think you touched on a little bit, and how that might progress in ’17 and into ’18, just in the core business even forgetting about the cross sell opportunity. I'm just wondering standalone, how you think about the returns on that investment and what it might mean for growth?
Andrew Florance: Sure. So, yes, I do. So, as I have been looking at some of the really strong sales results we have had in the last quarter or so, I can’t definitively create a formula that proves that X resulted in Y but I have thought on multiple occasions that this dramatically better research quality, which has come with an investment has resulted in these higher sales. And one of the things that is happening is just the volume of communication our researchers are having with people in the industry and the higher quality training they have and the better job they do at branding the value of our market places, just positions CoStar and LoopNet higher in the minds of these prospects, which I think translates to sales. So, our research operations, when they are having these conversations with people about how they can put their listings in front of the biggest market of buyers and lessors of real estate ever created, it sparks the imagination of that person with a listing and I believe that shows up in those people buying product from either LoopNet or CoStar down the road. So I think our research department is not a research department, I think it is actually a marketing department of some nature. And when we go into ’17 and ’18 – when we go into the latter half of ’17 and ’18, I still think it can't be separate from the LoopNet CoStar cross-sell opportunity. These folks build relationships with people in commercial real estate. They will help position our products for the cross-selling. We can quickly adapt any positioning we need to do overnight with tens of thousands of communications a day to that research department. And then ultimately when we present to someone who has been using LoopNet as an information pack for years with a strong value proposition to upgrade now to CoStar information, having just infinitely better information that CoStar product, with really good tenant information, I believe will result in dramatically higher sales. So, did that – was there a second part of the question I missed there? I get so excited about our research department I start joining on.
Andrew Jeffrey: No, that was the question. Thank you.
Andrew Florance: Okay.
Operator: And our next question in line will come from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks, this is [Jackson] on for Sterling this morning.
Andrew Florance: Hi [Jackson].
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. You guys mentioned that the integration between LoopNet and CoStar in the back-end is going well. Can we just quickly get some more detail on that, and what has already been done? What still needs to be done and any kind of time frame you can put around what needs to be done?
Andrew Florance: Sure. The most to me – the most important thing show there is a technical component, where everything in the LoopNet product has to be rewritten to address the new backend database. There are hundreds of routines and systems that have to be rebuilt to look at a common system. You had to come up with methodology standardization between what was in LoopNet and CoStar. That is a pretty big technical load. We are through the majority of that. One of the more challenging things we had to do, not to just do the integration, but to do the integration really well and capture as much value as possible is we had to increase our research firepower, and make sure that we went into that conversion, that the quality of the product the people were evaluating was as good as possible. So I think the biggest accomplishment is having nearly triple the research flow by hiring hundreds of new people, setting up new centers, negotiating tax breaks, multiple leases, so on and so forth that was a lot of work. We have interviewed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to build that team. So that one is in place and I think that you will get the peak value of that research investment and quality, we will start to get to where we want to be -- in June of this year is where you really hit the full stride of that investment. You probably want to cycle for a month or so at that level before you really unleash the sales force to go have 50,000 demos. And we also have built the CRM system, the CRM team, which is important to do the integration and trainings that we expect will happen, and then we have gotten the sales force up dramatically in scale to be able to address the opportunity. We are adding some additional features CoStar to make the product even more attractive to people considering investing more to get the CoStar information solution. We have probably completed – we will complete a significant amount of the marketing required to support it and we are going to do a little bit more there. We are in a place where there is nothing magical about April 30th or June 10th or July 5th, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try to pull together two major ecosystems of commercial real estate and design it as such that you have the best possible outcome and we are more concerned with doing it really, really well than doing it really, really quickly. So, we are editing now basically. We are not authoring, we are editing. And we are editing. In good writing, you should know be editing and editing and editing. So that is where we are.
Operator: And the next question will come from Brandon Dobell with William Blair. Please go ahead, sir.
Brandon Dobell : Thanks. Good morning guys. Focusing on the information for the core business for a second, given the net new momentum and recognizing the currency headwind, what is to stop that business from seeing an acceleration in organic growth as you work through the year, and I guess maybe include that little broader just to keep the combination of information services and kind of the core suite business and see an acceleration in work through this year and the next year.
Andrew Florance: I love the way you say net new momentum. We call it the NNM.
Brandon Dobell: Nice acronym.
Andrew Florance: Yes. The nice thing is we are getting this increase in momentum before we launch the main effort, right. So this is in advance of what we felt would be the real net new momentum driver, which is the formal LoopNet integration execution. So, if that integration is successful you could see some momentum gains, but in addition, you also there is a pretty big landmark here that now an owner is our biggest client rather than a broker. So as that trend continues and as our analytics improve and we get deeper penetration in owner audiences, lender audiences, investor audience, that also is a potential accelerator. 
Scott Wheeler: And just putting some context to the financial side Brandon, in the second quarter last year the currency started to move, so we won't see much movement in Q2, but obviously that drops away for Q3 and we will pick up that percentage point, and so the wholebusiness will then see momentum in the back half as we start to doing cross-sell, although we really haven't built in any cross sell uplift at all in the numbers in the back half, and we are going to let the business get the software done and ready to go and in the market, and then we will see what happened to the fourth quarter.
Andrew Florance: And if Brexit occurs, we have de minimis exposure to the [French].
Operator: And the next question will come from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead. 
Brett Huff: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.
Andrew Florance: Good morning.
Scott Wheeler: Hi Brett.
Brett Huff: I have a bigger picture question on margin, one of the things in talking with investors that some of the folks are trying to figure out is what happens to the 40% pro forma EBITDA margin give or take exiting 4Q ’18, as we go forward, as folks are trying to work on their DCFs, there is some debate as to whether or not that remains at 40%, if it goes up a little bit, if it goes down a little bit, depending on investments, but I think that is one of the things that folks are really trying to get their head around and I'm wondering if you guys could just give us some color on it or maybe even more precise answer? Thanks.
Andrew Florance: I would be happy to take a shot and let Scott also address it, but the natural state of the business, if you look at every component of the business we are addressing right here is very high incremental dollars of EBITDA or margin dollars on each sale. So as we add another ad contract, as we add another information subscription, the super high margin sales. So the natural state of the business, when you are at that 40% margin in ’18, that margin would naturally grow to 50%, 60%, 70% and higher. I am not sure – we by no means have run out of things to do in the business or ways to reinvest that capital and create more value. So, we would be looking for good investment opportunities with the margin growth above that 40%. I don't think this is a time to sort of stop and we are a third of the way through the opportunity and clip coupons. But at the same time, the scale of the margins we are talking about at 40% the spread between 40% and 45% margins gives you an awful lot of firepower to invest in the business, and I will let Scott say something completely different.
Scott Wheeler: Of course, we haven't laid out our investment or spending plans for 2018 yet, and that will come down the road, and of course I haven't done anything for 2019. But you certainly can expect that the seasonal pattern of margins will continue given the size and scale of apartments business, we will continue to grow. And so you will always see this lower margins in the first quarter, dropping in the second and then picking up to the latter half of the year. So, after the 40% hits in Q4, you would expect it would naturally go down a couple of quarter and come back up even if we kept the average for the year the same. As Andy said, there is a lot of levers that will come through when you're growing $120 million in revenue a year with very high drop-throughs and you will have a lot of acquisition firepower from the cash that brings in or else we can continue to invest organically. So, we will lay those plans out. We will let but there is certainly potential to let margins continue after that or if we feel there are great investments either organically or acquisition-wise we will talk about those and make sure everyone understands why they are more valuable for us in the long-term than trying to sustain the margin for the short-term.
Operator: And the next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen: Good afternoon. Thanks guys for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense in the multifamily side if we look at revenue growth there, how much of that is – given the occupancy trends is that revenue per building versus actually attracting new buildings onto the platform, and then as a follow-up, given the fact that you are taking quite a bit of market share in recent times, have you seen any changes in behavior from some of your competitors as it relates to pricing?
Andrew Florance: When you look at where that growth is coming from, I would say first and foremost that traffic advantages we have right now over other sites – that traffic advantages are huge and the change that has occurred in the last five years, three years, two years is dramatic. So, Apartments.com has more than double, triple those traffic. So people have large budgets assigned to or allocated to marketing solutions that are no longer the best value for their dollars. So I think a lot of what is happening is basically shifting from older, less effective solutions over to Apartments.com, and there is a lot – there is tens of thousands of properties that are still back spending more money to get less exposure. I do think that puts downward pressure on pricing, competitors pricing, and when you look at the exact maths for us it is about the 22% year-over-year organic growth, 15% is volume, people switching from older, less effective solutions to Apartments.com and 7% of that growth is price mix, people bringing up the exposure level of their property and trying to drive more leads in the door. So, it is about 66 or two-thirds share gain and one-third price gain. I think that will continue for a while. 
Operator: And our last question we have in queue at this time will come from Mayank Tandon with Needham & Co. Please go ahead. 
Mayank Tandon: Thank you. I had a quick question on the apartments, sort of higher level,if Andy, if you could just talk about where you are in terms of penetration today, whether it is in terms of number of units or in dollar value terms. And first, in light of the fact that you now have presence in the smaller units segment, what does that mean in terms of market share for you today?
Andrew Florance: Sure. You get me rolling on a really certain – a nerdy discussion of penetration at each level, but some real important trends here. When we acquired Apartments.com 98% of their revenue was from properties with 130 units or more, which is the upper, upper half of the apartment industry. So if you have 44 million units out there, 17 million – I am sorry, 24 million might be institutional, maybe 12 million are in that larger unit mix size.  So traditionally the businesses because they had that print history of expensive fixed cost of print, the industry really addressed the 130 unit plus area. We are seeing tremendous growth in the – all the way down to the 40 units, 30 units, and that is a huge piece of the market. So, I was looking at some stats the other day where, a lot of our growth was in that lower area, and I think we can be successful all the way down to 10 units, 15 unit properties. So that will go for a long time, and that doubles the size of the market ultimately. The other thing is that as we get deeper penetration in the apartment space, and we have a bigger and bigger share of that institutional market, say the 100 units plus, we have a fantastic opportunity to layer additional services on top of that user flow. So if you have – we now have a very significant share of apartment hunters in the United States using our product to find their apartment. Millions and millions of people are finding their apartments on Apartments.com. That is 110 million Americans and growing. That is $700 billion plus of spending. Folks are in the market every 18 months typically to find a new apartment. There is a lot we can do with that traffic in that position. That doesn't require us to sign up new apartments, though I am pretty confident we will continue to sign up lots and lots of new communities over the years to come.
Operator: And currently we have no further questions in queue.
Andrew Florance: Great. Well, thank you everyone for joining us for this first-quarter earnings call, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.
Operator: And that does conclude our conference for today. Thanks for your participation and thanks for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

So, with that, I'll turn it over to Andy Florance.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Thank you, Rich. Good morning. As you likely have seen our earnings release, we achieved outstanding financial performance in 2016. Our revenue of $838 million for the full year of 2016 was up 18% versus the full year of 2015. Our sales force added $126 million of revenue for 2016, and generated $112 million of net subscription bookings. CoStar Suite revenue was up 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Multifamily revenue for the full year grew 22% on a pro forma basis. We dramatically increased EBITDA by $125 million over the prior year to reach $215 million for the full year of 2016. EBITDA increased 139% over the full year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins climbed to 31%, up 60% from the prior year's margins of 19%. CoStar and Apartments.com are very profitable business models, enabling us to expand our margins nearly 1,200 basis points year-over-year, while at the same time making important significant investments into future growth initiatives. We continue to make significant and important investments, but we still expect EBITDA from our 2016 result of $215 million to grow to a range of $223 million to $229 million for 2017. For the seventh quarter in a row, we achieved net new bookings of greater than $25 million and the fourth quarter net new bookings increased to $29 million. We had our best year ever selling CoStar Suite and Q4 was the second highest quarter ever for both CoStar sales and Apartments.com sales. Apartments.com's bookings were exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter and were up 62% year-over-year. We prioritize subscription revenue streams because we believe the subscription revenue with high renewal rates and greater visibility is higher value revenue. Subscription revenue for the trailing 12 months climbed $162 million to reach $637 million for the full-year 2016 and now represents 77% of our revenue. Our renewal rate for clients with five years or more business with us is steady at 98%. In 2016, we reached 101,000 CoStar North American subscribers, up 17% from 86,000 in 2015. We exited the fourth quarter of 2016 with a total of 691 sales staff and relationship mangers or a 30% increase of 158 people over the same time a year ago. The investment in more salespeople is paying off as we're delivering 14% top line growth on our flagship product on a much larger base. Of the 158 net sales head count adds in 2016, 80 were CoStar customer relationship managers working in the field. They conducted over 53,000 trainings since we launched the program in April of last year. And they're reinforcing the CoStar brand in every customer contact. We are seeing immediate results and heavier usage of our services, including those stickier services that entrench CoStar more deeply in the daily workflow of brokers. In our focus groups, we hear from brokers that this service emphasis is a significant value-add to their CoStar subscriptions. Better training clients who get more other CoStar subscription are more likely to renew, recommend and spend more with us. With the addition of these client managers, our experienced sales producers are freed up to spend more time selling CoStar. The primary motivation for investing now in these 80 new customer relationship managers is to support our efforts to upsell tens of thousands of LoopNet users to CoStar over the next two years. In order to put many of our sales reps closer to our clients and prospects, we invested in opening 30 new sales offices across the U.S. in 2016. We believe the sales force is more productive when they work as a team in an office location, instead of working from home and that our local presence demonstrates to our clients a commitment to the market. We believe this increases sales and retention. Our incremental investments in sales and customer service do not maximize margin in the short run, but they do deliver long-term competitive advantages and enhance long-term high margin revenue generation capabilities. We continue to believe we will exceed $1 billion of annual revenue in 2018 with 40% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2014, way back two and a half years ago, we began investing very aggressively to expand our platform into the multifamily sector. The apartment sector has an asset value of $3 trillion to $4 trillion with more than 100 million Americans living in rental properties. We feel that we're competitively advantage in the apartment space for marketing and information dollars. We also believe that the assets we are building to serve the multifamily side of commercial real estate are synergistic with our office, industrial retail, and landside of commercial real estate. As we close 2016, we've been working hard for seven quarters to make those investments a success. And I want take a moment to take stock of how we've used our capital to create real value for you in the Apartments.com brand. First, look at the amazing revenue growth we've achieved in such a short time. In Q2 of 2014 when we acquired Apartments.com, it had $86 million of revenue. As we exited 2016, our monthly revenue annualized for Apartments.com reached $240 million, an increase of $154 million. When you add the apartment-related information revenue we won because of this, we reached $278 million, an increase of $192 million from the start. We have grown $86 million of annual revenue at Apartments.com to $278 million in three short years. At this level of revenue, we believe we're now the largest, most successful player in the online multifamily industry globally. We did this by utilizing our information advantage, rebuilding the websites to refocus on the renter as the ultimate customer and we were the first to aggressively brand an apartment marketing side, as you would sensibly due with any mega consumer sector. Our effort to draw more renters to our sites to create more value for our advertisers has been a huge success. In the month we closed Apartments.com, the site drew just 5 million unique visitors for its advertisers. By January 2017, that number had tripled to 22 million unique visitors on our apartments network. As we have increased visitors in time, we have dramatically increased total page views from 23 million a month in Apartments.com at acquisition to nearly 250 million a month now, that's a tenfold increase. We are still hard at work increasing our traffic for our advertisers, and visits to Apartments.com are up 42% year-over-year according to comScore. We have a clear number one position in this industry in visits, unique visitors, and time on site as reported by comScore for December 2016. In 2016, the second full year of our operation of our new Apartments.com, we had 165 million more visits to the network than we had in 2015. More traffic is equal to more leads for our advertisers. In fact, the number of leads from the beginning of our acquisition of Apartments.com to now has increased 210% on a quarterly basis. Again, we're still working hard to grow that lead flow, and leads have increased 62% year-over-year alone. As we grow traffic and leads, we have grown sales. In Q2 of 2014, total Apartments.com bookings were $1.1 million. That number has grown more than twelve-fold, to $13.7 million in Q4 of 2016. The impact on our overall business has been significant. In Q1 of 2014, before we acquired Apartments.com, our overall CoStar Group bookings were $13.7 million for the quarter. That has now grown 114% to $29.3 million last quarter. When we acquired Apartments.com in Q2 2014, Apartments.com had 18,000 properties advertised on site. That number has grown 86% to 34,000 by the fourth quarter of last year. In Q2 2014, the average advertising price per property was $441. That number has climbed 37% to $606 a month in the most recent quarter. As the number of advertised properties has grown, we have gained very valuable data for our information products. There were no electronic – unit level fees connecting Apartments.com into the customers' property management systems in Q2 2014. Now we have over 20,000 plus electronic feeds, covering the majority of our advertisers' properties. Because of this high-speed flow of content, we have now collected 1 trillion rent points. Jay Spivey, John Affleck, Robert Jennings and I were awarded best paper from an academic journal article on how to use this big data accurately model apartment rents. Our annualized revenue from sales of the information derived from this model is now over $38 million. We have worked hard to win clients to Apartments.com. We held nearly 200,000 meetings with customers in 2016. And what we hear in focus groups is that they now consider us the best sales force with the best customer service. We conducted 22,000 surveys and asked, on a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Apartments.com to a friend? We scored 9.7 on average. That rounds to 10 on a scale of 10. I believe this customer satisfaction and hard work has resulted in a 23% sales productivity increase of the average apartments rep in 2016. Clearly, our leadership position is strong and growing in multifamily, and we're still in the earliest phases. We intend to build on that competitive advantage. The Hispanic population in the U.S. is approximately 57 million, 32 million of which are renters. This is the very fastest growing segment of the market, and could be as large as 128 million people by 2050. Hispanics represent 20% of the rental market, yet they are very underserved. We launched Apartamentos.com at the beginning of February with high value content translated by humans and low value free content translated by a machine. As our customers put ads up in English, we automatically translate them into Spanish. Renters can submit leads in Spanish and the site translates them on the fly for the leasing managers who don't speak Spanish. We plan to drive awareness of the Apartamentos.com launch with Spanish ads on stations such as Univision, Telemundo, and ESPN Deportes. In addition, we have a very aggressive SEM program in place to drive traffic. The initial feedback to the site has been very, very positive and I'm proud of what we've done with the site. Launching Apartamentos.com was and is a significant investment. Westside Rentals has been the number one website in Southern California for finding small rental properties for 20 years. It has collected content from 350,000 landlords. This unique content will give us a rich database of listings, availabilities, and landlords in a brand name that we expect will continue to draw massive amounts of rich content. Last year, Westside Rentals placed 71,000 branded For Rent signs in lawns and windows across the LA market, creating massive brand awareness. In the first few weeks post acquisition, we have made all that content available on Apartments.com. By doing this, we have nearly doubled the small property content we previously offered renters in Southern California. It is our belief that if we have dramatically better content, we will draw more renters to Apartments.com. More renters in the site will mean more leads for our advertisers and that, in turn, will drive more sales and continued share shift to Apartments.com. We expect the richer site will also drive increased organic traffic. We plan to capture what we learned from Westside Rentals and deploy those content lessons in markets across the U.S. We will see the existing Westside Rentals subscription to fade down as we've put the content in Apartments.com, and we hope to replace that revenue with ad revenue growth on Apartments.com. We have an aggressive marketing campaign to drive even greater awareness of Apartments.com in 2017. You will once again see Jeff Goldblum in the role of Brad Bellflower, the Silicon Valley maverick, as he shows renters from all walks of life a better way to find an apartment using the Apartminternet. We are filming five spots with him, including several Southern California spots featuring Westside Rentals. Our advertising spots focus on general audiences, seniors, and students and will most likely be translated into Spanish – or most will be translated into Spanish. As you know, we did not run a Super Bowl commercial this year, but we will have 9,600 TV spots during a span of seven months, up from the 5,400 we ran over four months in 2016. We hope to get better productivity and efficiency from our advertising dollars on this plan. We clearly have the most aggressive branding for online apartment rental listings ever executed. And we think this is an essential and wise investment. By year-end 2017, we plan to have invested approximately $100 million branding Apartments.com in each of three consecutive years, for a total brand investment in excess of $300 million. It's getting a lot harder to find people who are not familiar with Apartments.com or Apartamentos.com. There's a strong emerging profitability story for Apartments.com. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Apartments.com has swung from requiring investment to generating significant profits. We expect the profit profile of Apartments.com will fit the target margin investors expect from our core CoStar business over the years to come. Today, our apartment sales team is almost at full capacity, with approximately 225 field reps. There are over 80,000 large properties that we're targeting to advertise an Apartments.com that are not currently doing so. So we have an enormous opportunity to continue to grow our EBITDA with high incremental margins on new sales. Clearly, our investments over these two-and-a-half years of transformed Apartments.com into a very viable brand, we have become the clear number one apartment ILS on a combination of traffic, SEM, SEO, total communities, leased delivered, brand revenue and EBITDA. The focus for us in 2017 is up-selling and cross-selling LoopNet users to CoStar. Turning back to CoStar. The overall majority of our CoStar clients are commercial real estate professionals. They're brokers, owners, lenders, developers, appraisers, major retailers, institutional investors and the like. In sharp contrast, 99.9% of our 60 million annual LoopNet users are end-users like tenants, retailers and small investors. Only a tiny 2/10 of 1% of LoopNet users are commercial real estate professionals. Yet, 50% of the LoopNet product features cater to that small user base. Because the legacy design of LoopNet attempts to cater to both audiences, it fails to do a great job of meeting the needs of either. In 2017, we plan to change that. The 99.9% of LoopNet's audience that are end-users are very valuable target audience for our brokers and owners, who must market their commercial properties. Post-integration, 100% of LoopNet's product design will target the needs of end-users, and the need professionals have to market to them. LoopNet will become a pure optimized marketing platform. The first step is to migrate the small percentage of LoopNet users that are commercial real estate professionals trying to use LoopNet's information platform over to CoStar for their information needs. CoStar is a much better information solution for commercial real estate professionals. When we say a small percentage of LoopNet users, we mean the 100,000 professionals using it as an information platform, generating just under $40 million of LoopNet revenue. By contrast, there are 100,000 professionals also subscribing to CoStar Suite, generating approximately $400 million revenue. Many of the most intensive professionals using LoopNet pay nothing for the service at all. Obviously, CoStar information services capture a much higher price point. We believe that we can upsell thousands to tens of thousands of LoopNet information users to CoStar, generating tens of millions to hundreds of millions of net new subscription fees. We have a great track record here. When CoStar and LoopNet first emerged, we made a concerted effort to upsell CoStar to LoopNet subscribers and we generated $80 million in upsell subscription revenues for about two years. Our software teams are working hard to integrate LoopNet and CoStar databases into one unified database by May of 2017. We believe this unified database will be more comprehensive than either the two standalone databases. Post-unification all of properties listings, tenants, analytics and favorable sales and leases will be available only to the CoStar users. Going forward, LoopNet will only contain our advertisers' listings. This is a big change where currently 32% of the listings in LoopNet are from brokers not paying us a dime. Because of this, today about 54% of all active listings are visible in LoopNet. That creates a material negative substitution effect between LoopNet and CoStar. Once we eliminate the free listings, we believe that LoopNet's listing coverage will drop to 39% reducing the substitution effect, plus or minus. We believe that 28% reduction in listings will mean two things. First, the paid ads on LoopNet will get more attention, we'll not have to compete with the free ads. Second, the information value of CoStar will surge relative to LoopNet making it even more compelling upsell solution for the commercial real estate professional. Once the databases are unified, it will be a straightforward task to communicate clearly to brokers using LoopNet but they're only seeing a fraction of the market and they need to use CoStar if want to see the whole market. We planned to convert LoopNet information users to CoStar with a combination of end product marketing, end product result comparisons, retargeting direct mail and direct sales. And I'm going to throw in telesales. As we have approached the integration of CoStar and LoopNet, we have stopped pushing sales of LoopNet information products. We do not want to move a new customer into a product we know full well we're just about to discontinue. This product discontinuation creates a significant headwind to sales bookings in 2016, reducing our annualized net new bookings by $7.4 million. $3.2 million of headwind occurred in Q4 of 2016, reducing $32.2 million in Q4 net sales bookings to the $29 million we were reported for Q4 2016. Post integration, we plan to keep and strengthen our LoopNet marketing solutions that are currently generating around $100 million annually. According to Hitwise in January, LoopNet and our network of online commercial real estate marketplaces captured four times the unique visitors as the next 50 websites in that space combined, that's share. That market presence is unprecedented and our customers tell us that LoopNet really generates the lease they need to lease and sell their properties. We believe that LoopNet's share of traffic of the top 50 U.S. commercial real estate websites is greater than that of Zillow's, Rightmove, (24:58) Scout24, (25:00) or FINN.no's share of the traffic of the top 50 residential websites in their respective countries. These residential sites charge the average broker $7,000 to $33,000 annually for marketing services. By contrast, LoopNet's only charging an average of $653 per agent, per year. Eliminating all those free LoopNet ads is the first step in increasing the average price. There's a lot of room to grow LoopNet's marketing revenue and we look forward to having that opportunity. Over the next two years, we'll work to migrate tens of thousands of LoopNet users to CoStar potentially generating more than $100 million of subscription fees. Most of these prospects will carefully consider the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the information in CoStar before they make that investment to upgrade to CoStar. In anticipation, we've been hard at work upgrading our research capabilities to ensure that our information is the best it's ever been when we begin this one major upselling effort this year. In the fourth quarter 2016, we began expansion of CoStar research capability for this need by opening a new research headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, where we sit today in $27 per square foot space as opposed to the $50-some space in Washington – $60 space in Washington. After just four months, we already have 250 staff in place here in Richmond. We're doing more than just adding more researchers. We're working to make all of our researchers more productive and more effective. Moving to Richmond, we've begun to reexamine how we position our research process with participants in our industry. Historically, our researchers have reached out to brokers to "collect information" from them to update our database. Our branding was more about what we wanted from the interaction, a lot less about how they would benefit from the interaction. We have turned that around and now when we interact with brokers, we're reaching out to make sure we're maximizing the exposure their properties are getting in front of our massive audience of buyers, brokers, and tenants so that they can sell their properties as quickly as possible and earn their fees. Not surprisingly, they're much more receptive. Our audiences are very valuable to these brokers. 200,000 commercial real estate professionals use our sites to find properties for sale or lease. Our audience is responsible for up to $1 trillion in leasing and sales transactions each year. We believe our audiences are responsible for the vast majority of all commercial real estate deals done in the past year. On a typical day our audience executes 8 million searches for properties on our sites. 93% of the top 1,000 U.S. brokerage firms use our sites to search for properties for sale or lease, and that's just the CoStar site, we're probably 100% of the top 1,000 with all sites. Brokers are responding really well to this new branding and our researchers are much more productive. On a per researcher basis, we're conducting three times the number of broker interviews per day than we were conducting in the fourth quarter of 2015. We believe that having more researchers that are more productive will translate to higher quality data and more successful LoopNet to CoStar upsells. We are surging our investment in research this year, as we execute the final phase of the LoopNet to CoStar upsell process. We believe it will have a very high ROI, while reducing risks inherent in migrating so many clients to a new product. Research is the foundation of CoStar, in Wall Street parlance is the competitive motor on the business. It's what has differentiated CoStar from all the rest and allowed us to achieve outsized returns over many years. I view our investment in research as an excellent use of capital as we look to strengthen our competitive advantage for many years to come. Our research head count will continue to increase through 2017, but we expect some of the research head count to drop in the out years after we complete the LoopNet integration. As you know, we initially initiated a lawsuit against Xceligent for brazenly stealing and reselling CoStar's data and images on an industrial scale. The Daily Mail Group, which owns the majority stake in Xceligent is a multibillion dollar company that has all the resources necessary to enable Xceligent to invest in the U.S. to build content honestly. Instead Xceligent has paid an army of low-paid workers in the Philippines and India to steal our content. We filed this lawsuit only after an initial investigation revealed no fewer than 10,000 instances of CoStar's data and photos appearing on Xceligent's publicly accessible website. We believe that a comprehensive review of Xceligent's subscription database will reveal tens of thousands more – many more. What we know so far is Xceligent and its agents in the U.S., Philippines, and India illegally created thousands of LoopNet accounts, made 1.7 million requests for copies of photos and property information and systematically cropped out logos and added their own logos to our copyrighted photos. We also know that Xceligent has used listings and property information stolen from CoStar's subscription database in connection with its efforts to research and open new markets. We have amassed a significant amount of evidence of Xceligent's theft and we feel confident we will win in this case. Apart from the evidence of widespread illegal access and copying that we've already gathered, Xceligent's own former employees condemn its business practices as unethical and have confirmed Xceligent's method of building its databases based on "stealing CoStar information." Also what we believe is an early indication of the merits of our case, judges in the Philippines and India reviewed the evidence gathered to-date and found probable cause and ordered the extraordinary search or seizure of hundreds of Xceligent's agents' computers. Xceligent's public response does not deny that they have accessed LoopNet and CoStar without authorization a million times in aggregate in order to take CoStar content, or that they have copied or – and published thousands of CoStar copyrighted photographs. We firmly believe that even though this litigation will be time-consuming and expensive, taking the necessary steps to protect our intellectual property is absolutely the right thing to do and serves the best interest of our shareholders. Winning this lawsuit of course means securing a permanent injunction that will ensure Xceligent purges and stops stealing our content. We're also seeking monetary damages from Xceligent, including substantial damages for their infringement of our copyrighted works. Courts have wide discretion towards statutory copyright damages depending upon the willfulness of the infringements, and in this case we believe we already have the overwhelming evidence of Xceligent's willfulness. We know that despite having received hundreds of access denied notices and also having their IP addresses blocked by our security teams over 100 times, Xceligent rotated its IP addresses and used anonymizers and proxy services like Tor and HideADoor (32:36) to mask their identities. A former researcher for Xceligent said, I quote, "Xceligent managers specifically instructed me and my colleagues to crop out the watermarks on any image that we copied from the Internet, including the CoStar watermarks on the photos we copied. The removal of watermarks was part of the training I received at Xceligent." These are not the hallmarks of unintentional copyright infringement. On the contrary, Xceligent is an information company that understands copyright law and its blatant widespread theft of its competitors' copyright content at the direction of management paints an overwhelming picture of willful copyright infringement. Taking into account the number of our copyrighted photos we've already found on Xceligent's public website, we believe it's reasonable to expect that, once we conduct a comprehensive review of Xceligent's subscription database, we will find tens of thousands more. We also know that one of our previous copyright cases, captioned CoStar Realty Information Group versus Field d/b/a Alliance Valuation Group, the court awarded us $14,000 per infringed image. While we respect the wide discretion courts have in awarding statutory copyright damages and understand that it's almost impossible to predict outcomes, we believe the most likely scenario is a statutory damage award in the thousands of dollars per infringed image and the number of infringing images in the tens of thousands, resulting in very significant damages award. Xceligent's owners have the financial resources to pay such judgment. You can find details of litigation at www.costar.com/xceligent. We continue to see strong demand for CoStar's analytic capabilities. Today, we generate approximately $140 million in annualized subscription revenue tied to commercial real estate analytics. 39% of our revenue now comes from owners, lenders, and institutional investors. The commercial real estate debt and equity sector is now one of our biggest growth drivers. We expect outsized growth in the debt and equity area in the future. We're prioritizing our investments in research, product development and sales in that area. We have invested dramatically to increase the number of markets that our economists cover with quarterly written reports. We have built and are about to launch daily property level forecasting into CoStar, making this an even more powerful tool. Building on the success and popularity of our multifamily underwriting reports, we just released the Office version of Underwriting Report. We also plan to release Underwriting Reports for industrial later this year. We now show fantastic daily rental movements in our rent charts, and we added 50 new customizable real-time charts analysis to our products in 2016. In 2016, we integrated our CoStar and Portfolio Strategies into one unified platform. And we migrated all the remaining 200 client companies from the old Portfolio Strategies platform into CoStar. This represents 1,800 individual users, plus or minus. The conversions have resulted in $4.6 million in net new annualized revenue. We believe that combining the best of the high level analytics from Portfolio Strategies with the granular, always-current on-the-fly analytics of CoStar, we have the best-of-breed analytics combination going forward. This allows us to move away from a boutique offering servicing the top 1% of the potential clients, to a robust service that has tens of thousands of client opportunities, and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of high-margin revenue. Portfolio Strategies continues to sell excellent advisory services, which we will sell in tandem with CoStar Market Analytics. Lands of America, BizBuySell, and Commercial Real Estate Manager are three of our emerging high potential companies. Over the past five years, the three in aggregate have grown revenues from $19 million to $39 million, and they've grown their EBITDA from $2 million to $9 million. We have solid leadership at each of these groups, and we believe they'll continue to grow profitably for many years to come. CoStar Real Estate Manager is now managing a quarter of a million leases for our clients. It provides market-leading real estate management software to retailers and global companies, and was one of the first in its industry to market with its new lease accounting module. The new module helps companies get in compliance with new FASB standards for lease accounting. The new standards require companies to include the value of practically all leases on their balance sheet. In November of 2016, we announced an alliance with BDO to help companies to get in compliance with the new accounting standards. We're also working with PwC and other leading accounting firms here. I have to say, I wish Professor Ryan Hart, my accounting professor in college, could have been there as one of our multibillion dollar customers raved about how good my accounting software was. He would have fallen over dead if he'd heard that. Release of the new leasing standards is already driving demand for our service, as net new sales of Real Estate Manager increased by 32% in 2016 over 2015. New customers in 2016 included major retailers and global companies such as GE, Adidas, Cardinal Health, Citi, State Street, Windham, Owens Corning, Five Guys, and many others. Our recently acquired German commercial real estate information provider, Thomas Daily, turned in a strong initial performance, growing revenue 17% fourth quarter 2016 over fourth quarter 2015, as we grew their field sales staff from two to seven. Our Spanish commercial real estate information provider, Belbex, is making strong progress growing its coverage of the Madrid market. At the beginning of 2016, they tracked 2,700 space available listings in Madrid. We have tripled or quadrupled their research team, canvassed the entire market, and have uncovered 26,000 potential new listings. We can confirm these listings in the months to come. We could increase our coverage tenfold this year over the legacy Belbex databases. So finally, to wrap up with commercial real estate markets, occupancy rates at year-end 2016 reached new business cycle highs for office, retail, industrial properties and rent growth for the industry as a whole averaged 3.9%, which is nearly double the 2.1% inflation rate. The real estate capital markets invested $600 billion in sales in 2016. Although that was down 7% from the record set in 2015, it was still the second-highest volume ever recorded, and 90% higher than the average since the year 2000. There is broad strength in currency rates. More than half of the office and retail metros reported business cycle high in occupancy in Q4. Furthermore, over 70% of apartment logistics markets have higher occupancy rates than the 2006 and 2007 average of their last market peak. So clearly, the key driver of investment returns, occupancy, is very strong right now. Analysis of the apartment market shows that it is becoming increasingly competitive. Effective rent growth has dropped to 2.4% from 5% a year earlier. The slowdown stems partly from 209,000 new units delivered in 2016, which is over 50% more than the 10-year historical average. New apartment supply pushed vacancy up to 6.1% from 5.6% a year earlier. And 2016 marked the first year in this market cycle with higher vacancy. But we believe that bodes well for Apartments.com, as owners will work harder to find renters for their properties. Office fundamentals remain strong. Occupancy hit a business cycle high of 90% in the fourth quarter of 2016, up 30 basis points over the levels in the fourth quarter of 2015. Year-over-year rent growth of 3.2% marks the 13th consecutive quarterly period when annual rent growth exceed 3%. This story, high occupancy, well above inflation rent gains, and net absorption above historical averages, is repeated in other real estate sectors, including retail, logistics, light industrial and hospitality. Real estate's broad strength has helped attract increased demand for CoStar's products and services. In summary, the fourth quarter 2016 was highlighted by solid revenue growth, strong sales in CoStar and in Apartments.com and huge margin expansion year-over-year. At this point, I'll turn it over to Scott Wheeler, our CFO, for the really interesting stuff.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Great, Andy, thank you very much. 2016 was certainly an outstanding year financially for CoStar Group. As Andy mentioned, our revenue in the full year increased 18%, which translates into a 14% growth rate on a pro forma basis. These pro forma results include the revenue from Apartment Finder for 2015, net of the revenue streams that we eliminated such as Finder Social. In the fourth quarter, we reported $218 million of revenue, increasing 13% versus Q4 2015 and 14% including the impact of foreign currency movements in the UK. Looking at our revenue performance by services, CoStar Suite revenue growth accelerated throughout the year, exiting Q4 2016 at a 14% growth rate or 15% on a constant currency basis. This is a full 400 basis point improvement over the comparable 11% growth rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015. The acceleration of the growth rate in 2016 is the result of continued investments in our sales force and analytics products as Andy mentioned earlier. As we move to 2017, we expect the CoStar Suite growth rates to moderate somewhat from the 2016 levels to be within a 12% to 13% growth range. This moderation in the growth rate is a result of timing of large contracts in 2016, as well as the effect of continued strong revenue growth on a larger revenue base. Revenue growth rates in information services, which is approximately $19 million per quarter, turned negative in the fourth quarter of 2016 as expected. This is a result of our decision to wind down the LoopNet information product ahead of the planned integration this year with CoStar Suite. We expect information services revenue to decline at mid to high single-digit rates in the first half of 2017, and low double-digit rates in the second half of the year. We expect full-year revenue in information services to decline in the 9% to 11% range overall. Over time, as we move the LoopNet commercial real estate professionals to CoStar Suite, the related revenues will also move out of information services and into CoStar Suite services. We do not expect this to be a material impact to CoStar Suite revenues in 2017, but rather in 2018. In multifamily, our 2016 revenue increased 40% year-over-year, which is 22% on a pro forma basis. For the fourth quarter of 2016, multifamily revenue growth was slightly below 20% as expected at 19%. For 2017, we're raising our growth expectations for multifamily revenue to the 20% to 22% range, based on strong fourth quarter sales. This is driven by the rebuilding and the effectiveness of our sales force in multifamily. We do not expect a material amount of revenue from the acquisition of Westside Rentals in 2017 as we transition this revenue model from rental subscriptions over to advertising revenue. Rounding out our service performance, commercial property and land grew 11% year-over-year, both for the full year and in the fourth quarter. We expect these services to continue to grow in the low double-digits in the range of 10% to 12% for 2017. Over to margins, our gross margin came in at 79% in the fourth quarter. Vast majority of our cost of revenues relate to our research operations, which as Andrew mentioned, we're expanding with our new research center in Richmond, Virginia. Accordingly, we expect our gross margins to moderate in 2017 into the 75% to 78% range as we scale up our team in Richmond. Our operating expenses in the fourth quarter were down $5 million sequentially versus the third quarter of 2016. This is a result of our expected seasonality in our marketing spend, which was partially offset by legal costs related to the Xceligent litigation of approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses increased $13 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to increased sales and customer service investments, litigation costs and new product investments. Now, let's take a look at some of the performance metrics for the quarter. As Andy mentioned, our expanded sales force delivered $29 million in net bookings in the fourth quarter of 2016 despite the negative net new bookings effect from information services. We expect this negative net new bookings effect to continue throughout 2017. Our cross-selling of LoopNet users to CoStar is expected to result in increased CoStar Suite bookings in the second half of 2017, but it's not expected to have a noticeable impact on revenue growth until 2018. Net new bookings were strong in the fourth quarter as with annualized net new sales on annual subscriptions of $27 million. Both of these metrics showed positive sequential trends with increases of 13% and 10% respectively. We believe net new bookings is the most relevant of the two metrics to indicate the overall direction of the company. Accordingly, we plan to continue to provide net new bookings each quarter in the future, but we'll no longer provide the annualized net new sales on annual subscription metric. Renewal rates on annual contracts were 90.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016, equal to renewal rates in Q4 of 2015 and broadly in line with trends for the past six quarters. I'll now turn to our outlook for the full year and the first quarter of 2017. For the full year of 2017, we expect revenue of approximately $935 million to $945 million or 11% to 13% year-over-year growth versus 2016 results. Our revenue growth rates are modestly lower than the growth rate achieved in 2016, primarily as a result of the expected revenue decline in information services of approximately 9% to 11% that I mentioned previously. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2017 in the range of $223 million to $225 million, representing top line growth of around 11% to 13%. In terms of earnings for the full year 2017, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $4.18 to $4.28, based on 32.8 million shares, which is broadly in line with the results we achieved in 2016. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow from $256 million in 2016 to a forecasted range of $260 million to $265 million with a margin of approximately 28% at the midpoint. This represents a modest year-over-year decline of 200 to 300 basis points when compared to the 1,200 basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margins we just delivered in 2016. When taking the two years together, by the end of 2017, we expect to have grown our margins 800 to 900 basis points from the beginning of 2016 while also making these very significant investments to support the future growth and security of our business. Our outlook for 2017 earnings and adjusted margins include two important initiatives since we last updated you on our October call. First, our full year forecast includes $50 million (48:46) or $0.28 per diluted share associated with the Xceligent litigation. As Andy discussed, taking the necessary steps to protect our intellectual property is absolutely the right thing to do and serves the best interests of our clients and our shareholders. We currently expect the 2017 cost of this litigation to be in the range of $10 million to $20 million, and have not assumed any potential outcomes in our forecast even though there is potential and precedent for material damage awards. We'll continue to provide updates quarterly as we progress throughout the year on this matter. Second, our outlook includes the impact of the January 31 acquisition of Westside Rentals, the leader in content for small rental properties in Southern California. We expect this acquisition to create valuable content, traffic and advertising synergies when added to our Apartments.com network. Accordingly, we need to transition the Westside Rentals revenue model away from rental subscriptions and over to advertising revenue, consistent with our existing multifamily business. This transition results in modest dilution of approximately $5 million or $0.10 per diluted share in 2017. With regards to our plans for marketing costs, we anticipate total marketing costs for 2017 at the same level as 2016, but with a higher level of spending for direct marketing in our information business to support the LoopNet and CoStar integration effort. Advertising spend is more heavily weighted in the first half, but the second quarter expected to be our largest marketing quarter, with as much as 40% of our annual marketing budget expended in that quarter. As a result, we expect the second quarter would be the low point for adjusted EBITDA margins for the year, as was the case in 2016. With regards to margin progression throughout the year, we expect margins to decline in the first three quarters of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. The decline coincides with the ramp-up of our research investment and the timing of the vast majority of our annual marketing spend. For the fourth quarter, we expect to exit 2017 with adjusted EBITDA margins above 35% and above our Q4 2016 margins. The high degree of leverage in our business model following periods of investments gives us confidence in achieving our goal of 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018. We expect first quarter 2017 fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.92 to $0.97 based on 32.4 million shares. Our outlook assumes approximately $4 million in costs associated with the Xceligent litigation in the first quarter. Overall, the company delivered an impressive and exceptional performance in 2016, and will continue to focus on investing to deliver this profitable revenue growth in the future. And we'll now open the call up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. Okay. The first question is from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon or good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yes, we can.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Yes. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us a little more detail – the detail you guys gave on kind of the tenor of the sunsetting revenue, the booking of the cross-sell revenue into Suite happening in the second half, but not hitting the P&L until 2018? Is there any more detail you can give us on that? A lot of the questions we got after the release last night was, is that the primary driver of what people thought was the lower guide or is there additional sort of incremental spending on research or things like that that we're not seeing or is it all just the timing of the Loop sunset?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: I'll let Scott answer most of that, but I would say that the LoopNet sunset does create a very material and significant headwind, and you saw a lot of it in the second half of 2016. We still perform very, very well, but it's just a significant headwind. You're trading out $60 a month subscriptions for $300 a month subscriptions, but the $60 going out, and we haven't yet sort of seen the – we're seeing the money going out from the $60 ones being discontinued. We're not yet seeing the mass of the $300 ones come in and those come in the middle of the year. So we're being conservative around that real and ugly sort of reality.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. And Brett, that played a lot into our thinking obviously as we came out with our numbers for the year. We certainly know that the direction of travel of info services, which we just talked about is $7 million, a 9% to 11% drag. And then we fully expect there'll be good selling efforts in the second half, but as we've talked before, we don't intend to build those into revenue until we let those sales build and are taking a cautious approach that those will help us in 2018 and not materially in 2017. With your question on investments, yeah, there's no new investments from what we've talked about before, we're putting a lot of our investment power this year into research. You heard us talk about obviously Richmond, we're also investing in further field research, we're investing in research in Canada and in our international markets. And so when you take all of the grounded investments in research to put our data and our products on the best footing, it's all those things together that puts us into the guide that we came out with today. And which when we talked about back in October, you'll recall we were concerned that 2017 was expected to have a significant margin growth, just like we had in 2016. And at that point we said, we need to caution everybody that wasn't going to be the case. And so when we finally finished our planning this year and came out with our guidance, those are still the primary investments, and the uncertainty on the top line from the LoopNet conversion is the other factor in deciding where we wanted to come out today in our communication.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks and good morning.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Hi, Andre.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I guess I just had a question on the margins as well. If you guys maybe talk a little bit about 2018, I know you just put out 2017 guidance, but there's a lot of focus on the exit of 2018 at 40%, I guess, how do you think about the full year margin as opposed to just exiting at 40% given you just talked about the first three quarters of 2017 being down, but then obviously a huge pop in the fourth quarter exiting at 35%?
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah, good question. The reason I talked about the trajectory of margin this year is really to demonstrate when we finish a period of investment, which Andy mentioned a lot in Apartments as well, but as soon as you finish that period and obviously the sales continue to run up at that very high and predictable rate that we have, then the margin and the profit move up very quickly, which you've seen us do many times in the past. So we still expect that in 2018 that we will see margins moving north for the entire year, and then as we have seasonally shown that in the fourth quarter is always going to be the highest. I believe if you look over the past couple of years, it's typically 5%-ish higher margin in Q4 than in the other quarters. So that's going to change based on obviously sales pace and cost management, which is again in our control. So, obviously, we're not giving any guidance on 2018 yet, but we can't say that, that we still expect to be able to deliver what we said in our commitments for the over $1 billion of revenue and the 40% exiting, and the full year will be higher as well.
Operator: Next question from the line of Mayank Tandon, Needham & Company.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. I just had a quick question around the acquisition pipeline, your expectations in terms of timing of future deals. And then, also maybe some word on the international opportunities as you're looking at investments outside the U.S.?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Sure. So, there is definitely a robust set of opportunities for us both in the – a lot of them are around the apartment space, but there are a number of things we're looking at. We're always talking to people. The amount of work we're doing right now around this LoopNet to CoStar conversion, keeps us focused on that task at hand to big lever in the business. So, we're focused on that through for a long time like at least through May and really through the summer. But there are opportunities out there. We obviously can't discuss specific things and some of those could accelerate sooner if the timing on the other side was such that if we had to move, but there's a broader range of opportunities. On the international front, I'm pretty happy with where things are shaping up there. The United Kingdom, which was our first foray overseas. It was a lot of work, a lot of learning. It's been very successful. We have, I don't know, 97 of the top 100 brokerage firms there as clients. It's a profitable business. It's a very strong business. We've got a good management team there. Canada, our second material foray overseas, there was a competitor there, been there for many, many years. Within our first two years, we outpaced them in the revenue, and I think we're really just at the starting point there. I think we have a lot of potential upside there in Toronto. We are investing a little bit in research out there to fill that out, make sure that we're covering all the markets there, Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Toronto. We believe we now have the best databases for commercial real estate in Canada. And as you can see, as we're moving into the more language software, we will be doing a polyglot version of CoStar in the next 18 months or so. So then, Madrid has been a fascinating experience. It's like looking at data flow in 1980. We've really gone to that market, and to increase the perceived amount of listing opportunities for brokers tenfold in the first year is dramatic. In – really that's our primary focus right now, is standing that up and making that happen. And then Germany, we've got a good solid business there, but we think this is an opportunity to grow without changing anything, just to leverage the product further and drive more sales by just doing a different philosophy, more focused selling efforts there. So, we are continuing to keep our eyes open for other opportunities overseas, but it's probably at about the pace that you're seeing right now, which is a country a year.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Co. LLC: Good pace.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. There's not many countries.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Co. LLC: It takes 140 years to cover the world and something like that.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. We'll be down to North Korea in 120 years.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. You guys gave us a lot of data. I just want to make sure that I'm clear on a couple of things. So, on the margin front, if we adjust back for the things that we didn't know the last time – last quarter when you talked to us, so the litigation costs, the acquisition, et cetera, would you say that the pace of investment that you're putting forth for 2017 is on par with what you talked to us last time, or is an acceleration? Because I think where a lot of our models where, we still had slight improvement in margin for 2017 and then the improvement to the goal. So I think this – part of the reaction is, it's a departure from that, but again, there's moving parts. So was that core investment in line with what you were talking to us about a quarter ago?
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. And this is a question, as we go through our planning process and again, back in October, we hadn't finished out what our investments would look like. Again, investing in research is the primary piece, and you heard Andy talk about other components of research that are important, like productivity of research. So they need to put technology folks in to drive software productivity that can allow these 1,000 researchers to deliver productivity over time and create a better cost profile. And so, you put all these things in and then you come out with what your investment plan is here (1:01:36) for the budget, which we do in the early part of December. I was actually pretty happy when we came to the end of that process and, on a $720-some million cost base, we came within 1% of where that cost would be when we finally ended up with our budget. So, I would rather – of course, had it been above the margin we said last time, but it was $7 million or so below. So we're not unhappy with where it came out, it's still in line with what we're investing, and we still expect the same great returns on top of the money that we're putting back into the business here.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Really, we have a great business here, except for Jon Coleman, our General Counsel, spending way too much on legal.
Operator: Okay. Next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question, appreciate it. Andy, I guess, high level question, and I think this is kind of what we're hearing today is, how do you talk to us in the investment community about the long-term growth and profitability of CoStar Group? You've made a lot of investments and, obviously, a pretty aggressive growth initiative, which seems to be working well in apartments. But are we going to have this sort of sawtooth pattern into perpetuity, or is there a point at which CoStar kind of goes into harvest mode, has the right assets in place and really sustainably grows EBITDA, because I think that's critical for the stock from here (1:02:59)?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Sure. Well, so I would say it's a very fine-tooth sawtooth blade. So you got real lumberjack stuff with big blades, real big sawtooth, and you got a real fine metal one, this is a fine metal one. So, when you really – unfortunately, I've been at this for 30 years. So, when I look at it in the broader picture, it is a very actually, fairly smooth, consistent EBITDA expansion profile. So, $215 million was a pretty significant advance over each of the X number of years – with variation. So, we're having a lot of discussion around a couple of points this year. We really frankly envision a much, much larger business than what CoStar Group is today. So, I would inspire more to what something like my friend Jeff Bezos has done, or Mike Bloomberg has done, something that is a lot. The goal of 2018 $1 billion in revenue is a important goal, we keep articulating it. The 40% EBITDA margin, that's not my goal. We'd like to be talking about $5 billion in revenue some day, so we are definitely playing a little bit of a longer-term growth game, and that's a reality. And we see things like this LoopNet-CoStar conversion this year, where it basically impacts the entire commercial real estate industry throughout the United States in a very fundamental way. We just approached that very carefully and we want to make sure that, whatever we do this year keeps us on track for our true long-term goals, which is building a business that's an order of magnitude larger than the business we have today.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from the line of Brandon Dobell, William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon B. Dobell - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. How do we think about the progression of the sales force this year? Do you have the right numbers or should we see a continuation of kind of mid-to-high or maybe even low double-digit head count growth? And if so, where should we expect those people to be concentrated in?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: I would say that we're largely stable where we are. Incrementally, mechanically, it could be plus 40, could be plus 20. Big picture, we have the sales force we need. Just finished our sales conference, you look at that sales force and said, oh, my gosh, that is an enormous sales force. And it is an incredibly competent sales force and it is a great team to go to market with. So, we are very happy with it. I think we are probably more focused on the fine tuning details, some organizational shifts here and there, minor things, and we might shift a little bit of focus to inside sales as we convert LoopNet clients and markets that are far away from one our field offices. But these are all pretty minor. It's roughly – we're very happy with what we've got right there and to stand in front of 750 people at that sales conference and see the team we've amassed, you're like wow, it's impressive.
Brandon B. Dobell - William Blair & Co. LLC: And in the last couple of quarters, you guys have talked about, I guess, let's call it a different go to market strategy with the apartments assets, just more points, better organization, et cetera. How much more work do you have to do there nationally to get it to where you really think you've got the right go to market strategy or has there been many changes in the last ample of months based on what you saw kind of middle of 2016?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: I guess you get a different answer if you talk to me or some of the sales people. The sales people feel that we have them worked at 100% of capacity, and I think doing a fantastic job I'm really happy with the customer service ranks we're getting from people, the 9.68 or whatever it is. And so I think we're in a pretty good place. We did institute the pure hunter role last year and so that's maybe four, five months old. We're fine-tuning that, but I think that's progressing well, where we want to have a little more touch point with our major accounts. We're selling more with the top 50 accounts than we do in the rest accounts overall. We still think there's more room to do even better there. But again, big picture I'd say, fairly happy with what we've got there, and I definitely believe we have by far the best sales force in the industry. I mean, there is some good sales people, some other operations out there that we compete against, but we definitely have the best sales force by a country mile.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: And the proof is in that net bookings number in fourth quarter for apartments looks very good and you can see that the outcome of that hard productivity work in the mid part of the year is starting to come through.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Peter Christiansen, Citi. Please go ahead.
Peter Christiansen - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for having me part of the mix. Quick question, so...
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Welcome.
Peter Christiansen - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: You're welcome.
Peter Christiansen - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): You cover the LoopNet CoStar transition pretty well and extensively here, but just wondering if you can give us some color on some of the conversation that you're having with clients and how they view it and what's been some of the early indication so far?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Well, we haven't hit the main thrust of this. So we're really waiting for that magical moment of when you have the unified database. At that point it gets – it's a very clean story, where there it's just there's 5 gallons in this bucket and 1 gallon in that bucket in terms of information. It's very literal and it's very clean story. We're having a conversation with people basically saying, look, almost everybody using LoopNet's an end-user. It's no longer fair that we would be hampering our whole net system back by bringing along a 0.2% group of brokers trying to use this information system. That story's working pretty well. But the other thing is that you have to roll back 5 to 10 years ago, where the industry really didn't – couldn't define differences between CoStar and LoopNet. They just thought they were two versions of the same thing and the picture has become clearer and clearer and clearer. We just ran a whole slew of focused groups around the United States and it was really nice because you could begin to see an understanding that was not there before from the industry, where they're like LoopNet is an essential tool to market your listings. It is not an information system. And look, CoStar is an indispensable information system. So we're actually just amplifying what the more knowledgeable people in the industry know, and then we're trying to push that out to the laggards and try to move them into the right slot. So I'm sure there will be – there's a little bit of folks, who have been getting a great deal for a long time. They've been getting literally hundreds of thousands of advertising exposures a year for free or they've been servicing their information needs for free for a long time, but the way we're restructuring the products, we're looking for some sort of fair price from everybody, who is really an ongoing recurring participant in the industry. And so and these are negotiators, these are brokers, the folks who are going to be – going from paying us nothing to $1 a month will make the loudest noise of all. But we're just going to work our way through it, and I think there is general acceptance to what's going on there. I also have been – I was sitting with well the CEO of Cushman & Wakefield the other day, as he was – as we were meeting with a head of – a gentlemen that runs North America. We were meeting with the person that runs Canada and it was fascinating to listen to him explain our business to his Canadian leader. And he talked as much about our distribution of – the importance of our distribution channel content from the marketing perspective and that was a new – personally I never heard a CEO or senior person actually clearly divide the two products as complementary both necessary working well together but very different functions. So, big picture, I think there's a little bit of – there is going to be a little bit of noise and pain as people figure out they're getting a great deal, the gig's up or too good a deal, the gig's up. But we're very excited about what we got here going on this year. Salespeople are even more excited than I am. They're thrilled. I don't know if I answered your question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Patrick Walravens, JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Walravens - JMP Securities LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess as you look to scale beyond $1billion in revenue longer term, what markets do you feel you need to enter and would you be open or would you consider expanding into the property management software market? That's it from me. Thanks.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Sure. Well, there's an awful lot of runway right here in the segments we're in right now, the analytics segment, international growth just penetration, like we only have 23% of the brokers signed up for CoStar property in the United States right now. A lot of opportunity to grow just right where we are for many years to come. On the subject of the property of management software, there's some very high quality companies out there in the property management world. The problem is as they each sit in a little high switch cost zone, sort of entrenched four to five positions that, we're little more interested in being able to work cooperatively across multiple zones and as soon as you acquire one of those property management companies, you sort of lock down into a fantastic relationship with 10% of the market. And we're a sort of company that needs to have a fantastic relationship with 95% of the market. And we don't want to get into a trench warfare winter invasion of Russia kind of thing with those property management systems. That's more of a longer-term outlook, something you come back to after you are in a much bigger place.
Patrick Walravens - JMP Securities LLC: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: So with that, I think that completes all the questions we can see here. And I would like to thank you all for joining us for the year end conference call. And we look forward to updating you next quarter.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: (1:14:22)
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining, while using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Thank you very much, Rich, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter 2016 financial results call. We had another strong quarter with profitable revenue growth. Revenue in the third quarter grew 12.5% year-over-year to $213 million. On a pro forma basis in the quarter, revenue grew 14% year-over-year. CoStar Suite revenue in the quarter was up 13% year-over-year with multifamily revenue in the quarter growing 22% on a pro forma basis. We continue to see tremendous momentum in our business, and our services continue to lead in each of their respective verticals. During the quarter, you can clearly see that we've made significant progress growing margins as we emerge from successful investments we made in 2015. EBITDA margin was 27% in the third quarter of 2016 versus 12% in the same quarter last year, more than double. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 32% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 19% in Q3 of 2015. I – sorry, Scott. I stole the next sentence from you. We generated $58 million of cash during the third quarter – I just had to say that.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Good one.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Sales continue to be strong. For the sixth quarter in a row, we achieved net bookings of greater than $25 million, adding $26 million in the third quarter of 2016. The first three quarters of 2016 are the best three quarters we've ever had selling CoStar Suite. Year-to-date, we are outpacing CoStar Suite sales in the same period of 2014 and 2015 by 52% and 33%, respectively. One of the factors behind acceleration in CoStar sales is that we have invested in growing our original sales team over the past few years. When we acquired Apartments.com, we let some of these CoStar salespeople to Apartments.com. Recently, we have shifted their focus back from Apartments.com to CoStar. This means we have more experienced producers selling CoStar in this year than last. But it also means we have fewer experienced salespeople signing Apartments.com advertising than we did this time last year. One of the things we're doing is getting prepared for the intensive selling efforts next year around the integration on the information sales. So, going back to Apartments, today, we believe we are approximately 30% penetrated in apartment properties with 50 units or more. 50 units or more are generally our core target market. This means we have a significant opportunity to grow our share in the apartment industry. We believe that we have the best product offering to market apartments online and that we could capture significantly more revenue if we're going to invest in growing our apartment salesforce. Our goal is to grow from the 100 or so apartment salespeople we had at the time of the acquisition of Apartments.com to a field sales team of approximately 240. We expect 200 of those salespeople to be account executives managing relationships with our existing customers, and 40 will be focused solely on new business development. We will consider growing this salesforce beyond that point if we continue to see profitable incremental production as we reach that level. I would not be surprised if we don't see that happen. Our first priority for this year for the Apartment sales team, was to improve our customer service levels to nothing short of excellent. We shifted our commission plan to reward higher customer service ratings, put a range of customer service metrics in place as well. I think the evidence has been a clear success, as measured by our client satisfaction score and our growth in face-time with clients. We completed 1,700 client interviews in the month of September. One important question clients were asked was, on a scale of 1 of 10, how likely are you to recommend Apartments.com to a friend or colleague. The average score from response was an absolutely outstanding 9.6 out of 10. I believe we achieved this score because of the effectiveness of our product and the effort we're putting in getting in front of our clients more often. In January of this year, we had less than 9,000 face-to-face meetings with Apartments.com clients. The face-to-face meetings grew through the year, and in the month of September, we completed over 20,000 meetings. Not only are we having more meetings, we also believe that we're having more effective and valuable meetings. We have produced a suite of customized reports that we review with the clients at each meeting that help them to understand the effectiveness of our marketing solutions and the competitive positioning of their properties within their market. Not surprisingly, our determined focus on increased productivity has resulted in some increased apartment sales staff turnover, slowing the rate of growth in the sales team. The apartment sales team has a combination of sales cultures from Apartments.com, Apartment Finder, CoStar and some new hires. Some of these cultures were not used to metrics or active management, which is a euphemism for the requirement to come to work regularly. Generally, as a company grows the size of a sales force, it's disruptive as territories change, managers focus on recruiting and training, and churn inevitably climbs. We began this year with 179 apartment sales reps and fell to a low of 141 reps in production in April. That did have a negative impact on net new sales. We still had strong net new sales, but that retarded a little bit. As of now, we have built the team back to 212 in production. About 70 of those reps are so new, that it's not likely they're producing any material sales. As these reps and additional reps we hire become more productive and are into production, we believe that we'll be able to accelerate sales growth and share gains. We have already added 20 additional Apartment reps that are currently in training or that have been hired for November classes and that takes the current total to 232 which is an increase of 65% over the count back in the mid-year. So it's quite an upcoming growth in number of producers in place. As we approach integration of CoStar and LoopNet, we've already begun to wind down sales of the LoopNet information products. We believe – we're convinced we are trading off lower dollar sales today for much higher dollar value subscription revenue opportunities over the next several years. This product discontinuation created a headwind to sales bookings during the past two quarters. Much of the discontinuing LoopNet information revenue is not on annual subscriptions, while 100% of the CoStar revenue we often replace it with is on annual subscription basis. Complementing this trend, we're now selling 61% of our Apartment advertising contracts on annual subscription agreements, up from basically zero on annual agreements when we first acquired Apartments.com. In the third quarter, 76% of our total revenue was from annual subscriptions, up from 64% in the third quarter in the prior year. Subscription revenue reached $162 million in the third quarter, up $40 million year-over-year from $121 million in the third quarter 2015. We like the visibility and stability that increasing our annual subscription revenue base gives us. It gives us great visibility and a little bit of recession-proofness. Our subscription renewal rate ticked up in the third quarter again to 90.7%. That's the highest level we've seen in the past six quarters. We believe that our increased focus on customer service has helped us achieve these growing and improving renewal rates. In addition, our new team of 65 CoStar field customer relations managers, working actually in our clients' office, conducted over 8,000 customer trainings in September and 18,000 in the third quarter overall, driving up the growth of usage of CoStar products, and more likely than not, to increase renewal rates ongoing. So let's focus a little bit more on the LoopNet integration. The significant important effort to integrate the two leading commercial real estate online platforms, CoStar and LoopNet, into one digital platform is well underway. Today, CoStar is an information product, while LoopNet is both a marketing product and an information product. After the integration, we plan to position LoopNet as a pure marketing product. We believe there's brand confusion around the LoopNet dual value proposition that will be resolved with the repositioning around a more straightforward, single marketing value proposition. The LoopNet users can be broken down into two general profiles. There are nearly 5 million small business owners, tenants or small investors who come to the site each month looking for a single new facility or a potential investment, making LoopNet by far the most visited website in commercial real estate. These small business users or tenants are not reoccurring users, and their highest value to us is the lead value they represent to our paying advertisers. The second segment is that there are hundreds of thousands of LoopNet users that are basically commercial real estate professionals. There are approximately 130,000 active LoopNet members that logged in to LoopNet over the course of 12 – over the past 12 months and conducted more than 100 searches each. An additional 300,000 visitors to the site conducted more than a 100 searches each in the past 12 months. This pool of approximately 430,000 intensive or more professional users is the target upsell audience for CoStar over the next few years, and I believe will result in a tremendous revenue opportunity for years to come. These users are in the market continuously and many are willing to pay for higher quality information. Today, LoopNet and CoStar are powered by two separate databases. The CoStar database is a higher quality curated database, maintained by our very large research team. The LoopNet database, while very large, is updated and maintained via broker user entry, and accordingly, is not as comprehensive or as quality-controlled as the CoStar database. Nonetheless, there's a lot of valuable content in the LoopNet database that is missing from the CoStar platform today. After integration, both LoopNet and CoStar will be powered by one unified database. A 100% of the content that is entered into LoopNet will be immediately available in the CoStar platform and it will be more tightly quality-controlled and monitored, making the CoStar platform much more comprehensive and more viable. Only the paid advertised content will be visible on the LoopNet platform after integration. This will draw a much sharper distinction in value proposition between CoStar and LoopNet for the brokers and professionals who really need to find the most effective information solutions to do significant transactions. Post integration, CoStar will always have dramatically more information available than LoopNet in all cases, or virtually all cases. We plan to market this reality aggressively in highly targeted online campaigns. We've identified about 24 segments that will break users into and will be tailoring highly-customized messages to each one of them to get them to the optimal upgrade path. We believe that this is going to put us in an excellent position to up-sell many of the hundreds of thousands of regular consistent LoopNet searchers. We believe that the scale of the potential up-sell opportunity is more than $200 million over the period of several years. Simultaneously, we believe that by purifying and clarifying the brand value proposition of LoopNet, as the essential tool to leverage the Internet to market commercial real estate, we can significantly accelerate the LoopNet marketing revenue as well. Once we integrate LoopNet and CoStar, we expect to grow and strengthen our curated research and simultaneously look to capture the value, efficiency and preference of some of our clients to enter their own data. I'm really quite pleased with the quality of the new interfaces we're now building to empower our clients to more effectively manage their content in our future integrated environment. We believe it'll make it much easier for our clients to manage their data and to communicate with their CoStar researcher. This should in turn result in much higher quality data. We see clear indications from our clients and prospects that our value proposition to them grows very significantly as we improve the timeliness and quality of the data we can offer them. We believe there's a direct relationship between the improvements we can make to the quality of the data and just how much that $200 million plus potential LoopNet to CoStar user up-sell revenue we can achieve and how fast we can achieve it. This revenue growth would be at extraordinarily high margins, so it's particularly important that as we approach this concentrated up-sell event, our research, data quality and software is the best it's ever been. In addition to the revenue up-sell opportunity LoopNet integration offers us, it also presents us an opportunity to dramatically increase the number of CoStar users, thereby increasing the network effects benefiting CoStar and potentially accelerating sales into completely new segments of commercial real estate professionals. In an effort to improve the likelihood of success of our LoopNet upsell efforts, we are accelerating our investment in CoStar marketing, sales personnel, software and research through 2017. We are planning to hire approximately 400 additional researchers to dramatically improve the depth and accuracy of our research, particularly with respect to tenants and retailers that occupy space in commercial properties. At the same time, we're eliminating 70 offshore research positions, making the increase 330 net new. Of these 330 net new researchers, 150 are property portfolio researchers added to ensure that our data quality remains high as we're handling intensive research tasks related to the integration during 2017. The need for some of this incremental head count will fall post-integration. Our Washington HQ facilities, along with our Columbia, Atlanta, and San Diego research centers, are completely full already. So rather than leasing more space in Washington, D.C. where the cost of living is high, we conducted a nationwide search to find the best possible location to place our anticipated research staff growth, as well as to relocate a significant portion of our existing staff. Our goal has been to find a city with much more affordable cost of living so that our researchers, many of whom are recent college graduates on starting salaries, can have a better quality of life. We believe that translates to greater longevity with our company, which translates to lower training costs, higher-quality work, and better client relationships. We searched for cities with apartment rents half of those in D.C. We looked for cities that are accessible to our corporate headquarters. We looked for cities that had high-quality office properties at half the cost of D.C.'s and for cities that has significant college student population from which to recruit, half the cost. Earlier this week, we announced that we are opening a research and technology hub at 501 5th Street in Richmond, Virginia. It's a beautiful building, and we're getting a great value. Greater Richmond is 1-hour and 42-minute drive from Washington D.C., and has – if you leave at the right time – and has office and apartment rents half of Washington's. Richmond also has tens of thousands of new college graduates each year. We intend to provide competitive salaries to our staff who could then be able to afford a relatively higher quality of life, and we believe we'll be able to achieve higher longevity and quality. The State of Virginia in concert with the City of Richmond provided more than $10 million in potential incentives to CoStar to support our new research center in Richmond. Over a period of years, we expect to have over 700 professionals in Richmond – 730 exactly, including tenant researchers, portfolio researchers and software developers. We will incur cost at the start-up, but over the intermediate and long term, we believe that this investment will lead to lower cost and allow us to further strengthen the quality of our CoStar information services. Richmond will allow us to provide even stronger data service to our customers. Stronger data means we expect to sell more services. We believe it will absolutely help us to convert on the huge opportunity we have in moving hundreds of thousands of LoopNet information users to CoStar information products, as we seek to deepen our overall penetration with brokers in the United States. We expect some of the research head count increases to drop after we complete the integration. I just want to reiterate that. Maybe someone could ask a question about that. Turning back to Apartments, we have reached an important milestone for Apartments.com. After 2.5 years of successful investment in the site, revenues have grown to now transition the product from losses to profits. I'm proud to say that we have turned the corner, having reached the breakeven mark in the third quarter of 2016, and we expect to be profitable with Apartments.com in the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that we're now entering an extended period where Apartments.com can contribute materially to our future earnings growth, rather than being a drag on earnings. Our investments over these past 2.5 years have transformed Apartments.com which was the number one – the number three – when we acquired it, it was the number three apartment listing site in visits and it was third in annual revenue by some distance with $86 million in revenue at the time of acquisition. We have now become – after all these investments we've become the clear number one ILS based on combination of traffic, SEM, momentum, total communities, and leads delivered. We believe we are the number one annualized revenue in the multifamily space in – with approximately $0.25 billion in marketing information revenue on an annualized basis, annualized in this particular quarter. From a competitive position, we have the size and scale to provide what I believe is the best marketing site and information services available in multifamily. According to comScore, Apartments.com increased its lead as the most trafficked apartment Internet listing site as unique visitors increased 28% while total visits were up 39% in the third quarter of 2016 year-over-year. Our apartment network had 37 million unique visitors in aggregate in the third quarter 2016 which is 26% more than the former top network in the apartment listing space. While the renter traffic to Apartments.com has grown year-over-year, our closest competitor site traffic continues to fall off. Our leads delivered to clients grew 20% quarter-over-quarter and 35% year-over-year. Since we have more than doubled the number of leads we're delivering to our clients on a quarterly basis since we acquired Apartments.com, we are now able to achieve higher prices for the superior service. Our average revenue per advertised apartment community on Apartments.com has climbed 56% to $602 per month, up from $385 per months in the first quarter 2014 when we had announced the acquisition of Apartments.com. So it's quite a significant increase there. Our average revenue per community has climbed 28% year-over-year from $471 per month in the third quarter of 2015 to $602 per month in the third quarter of 2016. In the same timeframe, the number of properties advertised on Apartments.com has climbed 38% or 8,692 properties from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016. Assisted – this was assisted by the integration of the Finder acquisition, but the net result has been very successful as we've achieved higher pricing and more volume and we believe very high customer satisfaction. Reflecting continued strength in the U.S. economy, commercial real estate markets are very healthy. A lot of questions about that, but I'd have to say that I really feel quite bullish about where the markets are right now. National employment is 6.3%; that's 4.6% over last cycle's peak in 2008. So, employment is 6.3 million over the last cycle's peak in 2008. What's more, the combination of solid job growth and low unemployment rates have supported personal income gains of 3.1% over the past year, and that's pretty significant when you consider that inflation is about 1%, so it's a really good result. As a result of the steady economic and job growth, occupancy rates for all property types except apartments reached a new business cycle high in 2016 Q3. Because of high occupancy rates, rent growth for all property types is well over the national inflation rate, ranging from 2.9% for retail to 7.1% for light industrial properties. Construction activities are very low in office, warehouse and retail sectors, and we're only adding 1% to the inventory of commercial space over all the product types. The apartment sector is the only property type that stands out for healthy levels of supply, about 4% of apartment inventory is underway for delivery over the next two years. However, the apartment sector also has very high occupancy rates and needs additional supply to satisfy very strong demand. Overall, commercial property occupancies are high, but supply is relatively modest. As we reported last quarter, the pace of commercial real estate sales has slowed for all property type. Specifically, year-to-date, real estate sales are down 9% from the same point in 2015, but those were very high peaks back in 2015. Year-to-date, sales changes range from a 4% increase in multifamily sector to a 20% decline in industrial sales. In summary, real estate markets maintain a high level of liquidity which is a strong indicator of investor confidence in the sector. Analysis of the apartment market shows it's becoming increasingly competitive as rent growth has slowed to 3.2% from 5.9% a year earlier. The slowdown of rent growth in part reflects the 134,000 new units delivered in the first three quarters of 2016, which is 35% more than the 10-year historical average. Net absorption of apartment units totaled 127,000 units year-to-date, which marks a 26% decline from year-earlier levels. Again, a frame of reference is important because the current net absorption rate is still 19% over the 10-year historical average. Since apartment advertising spend is highly correlated with weaker apartment markets, a more competitive market is likely to benefit our apartment ad sales. So a more competitive apartment market is good news for CoStar. One of the things I do want to highlight is that we are currently, in the United States, building about 0.6 apartment housing units for each new household formed in the U.S., so we fundamentally have a housing shortage. And you see that reflected when you look at young millennials in Washington, D.C. spending 55% of their salary to rent a modest one-bedroom or studio. So, I think, while there's discussion of oversupply, with the dramatic drop in single-family home construction, these elevated levels of supply in the apartment market are actually inadequate. Office fundamentals remain very strong, with occupancy rates up 40 basis points year-over-year earlier levels to a business cycle high of 89.5%. Year-over-year rent growth of 3.6% marks the 12th consecutive quarterly period of annual rent growth exceeding 3%. Net – office net absorption of 63 million square feet year-to-date is down marginally from 69 million square feet from the same period of 2015, but this level is 25% over the 10-year historical average. So I have to say that with steadily declining office vacancies, very, very modest supply of new inventory, clear-cut housing shortages across the United States, I have – I don't think I've been more bullish about where the commercial real estate economy lies. So, any upcoming economic shocks for sure are not coming from commercial real estate supply activity. So, in summary, the third quarter of 2016 was highlighted by solid revenue growth, strong sales particularly in CoStar Suite, and significant margin expansion year-over-year. Our transformation of the multifamily information and marketing industry is just the latest iteration of our innovation. I am very proud to lead our team of professionals who are accomplishing really remarkable things. We have made important investments that I believe position us for a long period of top line growth and market penetration. The upcoming LoopNet integration is on track, and I'm very optimistic about the potential outcome. So, at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mr. Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Thank you very much, Andy...
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: You're welcome.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: ...for that very informative and comprehensive update.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Is it tomorrow yet?
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: It will be soon. So, as Andy mentioned, we're pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2016. So let me provide a bit more color around the results in addition to what we already communicated in the third quarter press release which we issued yesterday. And my comments will focus on the financial results, performance metrics, and then our outlook for 2016. With regard to our financial results, revenue in the third quarter of 2016 was up 12.5% over prior year, which translates into a 14% growth rate on a pro forma basis. The pro forma results include the revenue from Apartment Finder for 2015, which is net of the revenue streams that we eliminated such as FinderSocial. Breaking down our revenue performance by services, we're very pleased with the growth in CoStar Suite of 13%, which is 14% year-over-year excluding the effects of foreign currency movements.
Richard Simonelli - CoStar Group, Inc.: I hope you don't mind, but I was so excited with that growth that I arranged for sirens to be sounded.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. Celebration outside.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: In constant currency terms, this is 200 basis points higher than the comparable year-over-year growth rate of 12% in the third quarter of 2015 and a full 300 basis points higher than the comparable growth rate of 11% we achieved in CoStar Suite in the fourth quarter of 2015. This acceleration of the growth rate in 2016 is a result of continued strong sales of CoStar Market Analytics and the shift in focus of our 200 plus person info salesforce back to selling information products following the Apartments integration that Andy mentioned. With this strong performance, we believe CoStar Suite will continue growing towards the upper end of the 12% to 14% range that we've communicated for the fourth quarter. The information services revenue which is approximately $19 million per quarter, grew in the low single digits in the third quarter as expected. You recall that information services includes the revenue from our LoopNet information products which we are not actively selling in advance of our planned integration of LoopNet and CoStar. Accordingly, we expect the revenue growth rates in information services to turn negative in the fourth quarter of this year. In multifamily, our revenue increased 17% year-over-year, which is 22% on a pro forma basis in the third quarter, adjusting for $2 million of discontinued revenue from 2015. For the full year, multifamily revenue growth is expected to be in the 20% to 25% range that we previously communicated. For the fourth quarter, we expect the multifamily revenue growth rate to be slightly below 20%, primarily as a result of lower multifamily sales in the second and third quarters of 2016 as we work through the sales force transitions and increases that Andy mentioned. Going forward, we expect the long term sales levels to improve in multifamily as a result of the increased sales head count and our sale force productivity effort. Rounding out our service performance, commercial property and land services grew 10% year-over-year in the third quarter and remain in the low double-digit growth range that we expect for the year. Our gross margins came in at 80.2% in the third quarter, a high watermark for the company. The vast majority of our cost of revenues relates to our research operations, which we are expanding with the recent announcement of our new research center in Richmond, Virginia. Beginning in 2017, the net research investment is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million per year. Accordingly, we would expect gross margins to moderate in 2017 into the 75% to 80% range as we scale up our team in Richmond. As Andy mentioned, there are a number of important benefits we expect to realize from expanding our research capabilities in Richmond. First, is we're out of space in our existing centers, expanding our facility in Richmond cost less than half of what it would have cost to expand here in Washington D.C. In addition, the cost of living in Richmond is almost 50% lower than Washington D.C. which allows our employees an improved lifestyle, which we believe will result in lower turnover and a longer tenured quality workforce. Finally, our incentive package from the state and local government is valued at over $10 million, making Richmond an attractive solution. .
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Thank you, Virginia.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Our operating expenses are down $5 million year-over-year as a result of previously announced plans to reduce marketing and advertising spend and from lower head count levels as a result of the integration of Apartment Finder. Seasonal marketing expenses are expected to decline further in the fourth quarter partially offset by higher personnel cost in the areas of sales and customer service. As a result of our continued strong revenue growth and cost management, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA reserves are favorable to the third quarter guidance range we've provided in July by $5 million at the midpoint. Now, let's take a look at some performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of September 2016, we had 665 salespeople, an increase of around 80 people from the end of June 2016 and up 155 people from March of 2016. We added sales resources across all of our major service areas; the largest increase in our apartment sales force. We expect these higher sales staffing levels will produce a positive tailwind in net bookings in the coming quarters. As Andy mentioned, we added $26 million in net bookings in the third quarter of 2016 along with annualized net new sales on annual subscriptions of $24 million. We continue to see strong net booking levels in the CoStar Suite while net bookings in Information Services are down year-over-year consistent with the second quarter of 2016 as we prepare to sunset the LoopNet information product in 2017. We expect these headwinds will continue through the rest of 2016 and into the first part of 2017. Our cross-selling efforts of LoopNet users to CoStar is expected to result in increased bookings in the second half of 2017 with the resulting revenue contributing to growth beginning in 2018. I'll now discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2016. With only one quarter remaining in the year, we're tightening our revenue guidance range around our previous midpoint of $837 million. Our updated full-year 2016 revenue range is approximately $835 million – $838 million, which represents pro forma annual growth in the upper end of the 13% to 14% range we previously discussed. Our fourth quarter revenue range of $216 million to $219 million implies a year-over-year growth rate of 12% to 13%. This will be the first quarter without pro forma adjustments related to the Apartment Finder acquisition. We continue to see positive trends in our expense profile and are again raising our full-year 2016 non-GAAP earnings per share outlook. Our revised range of $4.20 to $4.25 per diluted share is an increase of $0.13 at the midpoint compared to our previous outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $1.23 to $1.28. For the full year 2016, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA margin of around 30% which represents a significant increase over the 19% adjusted EBITDA margin of 2015. Moving forward, we expect to increase the level of investments we are making in key areas of the business to support future growth, such as the expansion of our sales teams, adding to our product development capabilities, and the recently announced research center investment in Richmond. As a result, whilst it's too early to give any detailed guidance for 2017, we expect minimal expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2017 compared to 2016, while we remain confident and committed to our long-term margin expansion target of exiting 2018 at 40% adjusted EBITDA margin, we don't expect the path between here and there to be a linear one. Overall, we'll continue to focus on investing to deliver profitable revenue growth, and I believe, we are increasingly well-positioned to achieve revenues in excess of $1 billion in 2018. With that, I will now open the call for questions.
Operator: Okay. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Absolutely.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I guess I'd like to understand a little bit, Andy, sort of the sales force refocus, if you will, the shift of some of those resources back to Suite. What – can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind that and your confidence in the ability to hire, train, and drive productivity of some of the new hires within the Apartments sales force, and I guess as a corollary, whether or not you think the path toward sort of market dominance is defined by more than 50% share has changed at all?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Sure. So when we acquired Apartments.com, they had the smallest sales force in that industry. And it was – and relative to the investment and the improvements we were making in the software and the branding of Apartments.com, it was too small to be appropriate for what we were doing. So we leveraged a very strong CoStar sales force and pulled them in, and they began leading a lot of the sales efforts for Apartments.com. But that means you are, to a certain degree, robbing Peter to pay Paul. You're taking people – good resources off of your flagship products and move in Apartments, and we were able to continue growing both while we're doing that. But as we begin to stabilize, and as we've begun to build up our dedicated Apartments resources that are not coming from CoStar, we wanted to move the CoStar sales team back out of that Apartments focus in preparation for what we think is going to be the huge selling event for the next several years, which is the LoopNet and CoStar integration. And so we are – as a sales organization, we are probably a little more intense than the average sales organization. And so we're in the process of building up an Apartments team that's a little bit more in our mold of folks that want to earn more and work harder, and that's a transition period. We're achieving it. We've now built up a much more robust management team then was there when we acquired these companies. We are having no trouble hiring people. We are filing up these slots very quickly. And I have confidence that we will enjoy the benefit of two strong sales forces, two strong relatively independent sales forces in 2017, one that is completely adequately staffed to capture the opportunity on the Apartment side and one that's prepared to executing the opportunity on the LoopNet up-sell and that makes me feel very optimistic. So – and we're not – growing sales forces is not new to us. We're – that's one of our core competencies and we're just executing on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Good morning, Bill.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And congratulations on formally achieving the number one rank in the apartment space.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Thank you very much.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: You mentioned the figure of 430,000 users or frequent users of LoopNet, who would make prime prospects for the conversion to CoStar Suite. So, you guys have been at this now for let's say four years. So what is the data now in terms of your ability to convert those users?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Okay. So, let's just look at this as phase one and phase two. Phase one, and phase one began immediately after we acquired LoopNet several years ago. That was the first time we were able to see who some of these very intensive users of commercial real estate information were that we, prior to the acquisition, did not know about. So we put a lot of focus on our sales force to go in and try to upsell those high-value users. And we were extremely successful. We upsold, I believe, about 10,000 users $80 million. The typical upsell was about 500% what they were paying for LoopNet versus what they would pay for CoStar. So it was very successful, and it really delivered for us for a while, and it really exceeded investor expectations. At the end of phase one, it became clear that the next phase, in order to optimize what you could pull from this revenue opportunity, you really need to create that one database. You need to make sure that there was nothing in the LoopNet system of value that someone wouldn't get if they spend significantly more to go into CoStar. That is no small feat, that integration effort. You're dealing with millions and millions of properties that you have to resolve and integrate. And in addition, we wanted to be very respectful of every element or potential element of our FTC agreement, so we wanted to wait until after that first three-year period before we really started to do that. And at the end of that period, the opportunity with Apartments.com came up, and we frankly shifted our focus on software – put a lot of software resources on what has clearly been an outstanding investment. As we have completed the integration of Finder and Apartments.com, we now can shift towards the integration of that backend database, and that tees us up for Phase 2. And Phase 2, I believe, is more significant than Phase 1. And we'll be able to seamlessly electronically market to people who are these 430,000 users. We'll be able to show them exactly the differences between what they're using and what they could be using. We divide them into 24 different customer profile or user profiles. We'll be serving up specific marketing content and retargeting to them around those profiles. And I believe that we have the opportunity to sell significantly more than we did in Phase 1. But preparing for Phase 2 has been a patient process involving a lot of technology and a lot of data flow modeling, but I look forward to when we can begin to pursue that in mid-2017. And as we do that, we'll be able to report to folks some of the progress we're making in the summer of next year, but it won't really majorly move the dial in revenue recognition in the middle of the year. It will be more so when it kicks in the third and fourth quarter – first quarter of the following year. But we'll be able to clearly communicate the upsell activity we have, just the way we did in Phase 1 where we're giving you real good stats on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Dobell from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon B. Dobell - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Scott, just to make sure I understand how you guys are talking about margins in 2017 and the phasing of some of these expenses as we go through. Maybe just a little more color on how we get to minimum margin expansion, what minimal may mean for you, guys. It could be zero or it could be a couple hundred basis points. Just help us understand how you're getting from where you're going to finish out 2016 to that 2018 exit target and what that curve may look like? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Brandon. As we go through our planning process, which we're doing now and we'll finalize our specific 2017 plans as we get into December, we'll definitely have a lot more to share with you in February on what that curve looks like. I think what we wanted to do today was, as we've obviously pushed very hard on the margin pedal this year and seeing that major growth, that we need to do some of these investments to underpin the growth rates in the future. So we don't want the expectation to be that's going to be this straight line between here and the 40% at the end of 2018. Now what we do expect is that the seasonal margin pattern that we see in the business, particularly driven by marketing and advertising, will continue next year where you have your highest margins in the fourth quarter, you have your lowest margins in the second, then on the first and the third, end up somewhere in between that. We think the margins we've achieved this year are certainly sustainable with the investments we plan to make. We think they will probably move forward a little bit next year. Exact basis points, we haven't set that number. But we just wanted to make sure that there wasn't the straight line between where we are today and there and that we're going to pause that straight line and reduce it a bit into next year and then we'll see a return to accelerated margin improvement in 2018.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Let's follow-up on that line of thinking. So, it would seem to me that in order to hit the 40% EBITDA target exiting 2018, based on the commentary, it really looks like you'll have to cut expenses, so we'll see operating expense declines in 2018 over 2017 in order to get there. Is that correct? And when should we see – it sounds like some of the nuance to your revenue target was at least $1 billion. So are you suggesting that either in 2017 or the beginning of 2018 the trajectory of growth would improve because you're making these investments in what should be revenue-yielding assets?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: I'd love to – so, Sterling, I think you could achieve it on the revenue side, but I do want to remind everybody that CoStar has shown again and again and again that we are able to reduce costs after an investment initiative. We are very good at that. I think we get credit for that. So it is possible that costs could come down post-integration. But that isn't necessary in order to achieve that 40%. But given what we're doing, our number one priority is we're going to move any and all ammunition required up to the front and to support the offensive next year is what we're doing. And then we would expect to complete it next year and then move on to the next thing. And then the second part of his question? It's horrible when asked compound questions to avoid the one-question rule, and then I forget the second one, do you remember the...
Richard Simonelli - CoStar Group, Inc.: We'll have him repeat the second part this time. We have an exception to the rule.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: If you can still hear me...
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yes, I can.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...it was really around the revenue acceleration from...
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yes.
Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...these investments, so the timing of it. So if you're saying you can get there based on revenue without expense cuts, the market is obviously reacting negatively to the comments around margins, but if there's near-term visibility that you're going to get pay back on those investments, I think that might be a different reality than just saying, hey, the margin expectations were out of whack.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Right. Well, thank you. What you said, yeah, for sure, right? So the reason we are making the investments we're making is because we believe that they have outsized returns. And we would expect that as that sales force grows on the apartment side, that trailing maybe six months of deployment at a new hire steady state, you would see material – you'd see increases in sales associated with those folks. So per person productivity is really quite good there. On the LoopNet integration side, we clearly believe and are reiterating and saying for everyone to hear that we believe that you'll get really significant sales off that upsell. We think that is what's going to happen. But we also know that as you discontinue the low dollar sales to replace them with high dollar sales, the discontinuation is upfront and then the upsells are trailing that. So, yes, we certainly – someone would have to have a complete lack of imagination if they were to think that we are just shifting our margin expectations for the business. We're not.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. This is Blake on for Brett. Thanks for taking my question.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Hi, Blake.
Blake Anderson - Stephens, Inc.: Hey, if you're using the midpoints for 2016 revenue, you guided the top end just down a little bit, and so that maybe reduced the midpoint down by $0.5 million or so. Is that the right math? And then I'm just wondering ex these increased investments you now expect, was there anything maybe fundamentally you're seeing differently in the market that's maybe the reason for that little bit of weakness into 4Q, and any of that would trickle over into next year? Thanks.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yes. So when you look at the guidance, as we said, we're tightening up the range for the rest of the year. As this business continues to grow bigger and bigger, we look at $0.5 million movement around the midpoint, up, down, in the middle. I just don't think we should read much into that as you look at the pace and the growth of the business. The strength that we're seeing in CoStar, we obviously expect to continue, and that's a very positive thing. We'll see the revenue rates that I mentioned in the fourth quarter of apartment slightly below 20%, and then a bit of the headwinds from info solution. So you're going to see a little bit of lumpiness in there like we've talked about last quarter over the next quarter or so, but we're still very confident about the long-term trajectory of the growth of the business, and the improvements that we're making are going to deliver that type of revenue growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Pat D. Walravens - JMP Securities LLC: Oh, great. Thank you. Andy, I'd love to hear sort of how you're thinking about M&A at this point with the projects you currently have on your plate. I mean, what's your appetite for it, and where would you be interested in doing it?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Well, there is a lot of M&A potential out there. There are probably a dozen different opportunities that we are tracking and watching and engaging with. But realistically, we're interested in doing things at a little more scale. And given the efforts we've got going right now with the LoopNet integration, we wouldn't want to be distracted from that effort. We want to complete that before we do larger deals. But there are, just like Apartments.com had a lot of intersections and parallels vertical to the things we were doing and we're good at, there are many other opportunities similar to that. But again, like right now at this very moment we've got 110 software developers working on the LoopNet integration. So that we're sort of focused on that. We're focused on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mayank Tandon from Needham & Co. Please go ahead.
Mayank Tandon - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. I'm sorry if I've already missed this, but I wanted to just clarify the LoopNet revenue that is tailing off to $40 million or so over the next couple of years. How does that trend over the next two to three years? And then how do you offset that with the incremental revenue that I think you've talked about, the $100 million to $150 million that is coming from the free searchers transitioning over to the CoStar Suite product?
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Sure. So some of that, about $10 million, $11 million is Property Comps, Property Facts which is a service we're just going to discontinue in 2017. So that's something where people are paying as little as $20 a month to have a product that we normally – that's a low quality comparable sale product that would compare with something that we normally charge several hundred dollars a month for. So that $10 million will disappear pretty quickly, and we anticipate that we'll be able to recapture most of that in the course of the following 12 months or so into CoStar Suite subscriptions. The other revenue on Premium Searcher, which is close to the $37 million will not immediately tail off because we will continue to provide those Premium Searchers with access to a little bit more content in the LoopNet site. And much of that revenue will tail off in the process of a conversion sale. So, if someone's paying $70 a month for Premium Searcher, that Premium Searcher will discontinue when we move them into a CoStar property subscription, typically a $500-and-some a month. So that revenue will sort of – we'd like to see most of that revenue be one-to-one upgrade to activity. So that should be a little smoother. But the property comps and property facts drop-off will be a little more immediate in that $10 million in the second quarter.
Scott Wheeler - CoStar Group, Inc.: Yeah. And that'll happen in midyear, so you'd expect half of that revenue and half in next year and then half kicks over in the following year of 2018.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
Andrew C. Florance - CoStar Group, Inc.: Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us for the third quarter earnings call, and I look forward to updating you at, wow, year-end. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rich. Revenues for our flagship product CoStar Suite grew 14% year-over-year, which is the highest growth rate since 2013. Apartments network revenue grew 58% year-over-year in the second quarter and pro forma 24% for the same period. For the fifth quarter in a row, we achieved net bookings of greater than $25 million, adding $26 million in the second quarter of 2016. In the second quarter 2016, we delivered $207 million in total revenue for an excellent top-line growth of 21% year-over-year. At $7 million, we achieved our highest quarterly sequential organic revenue growth increase ever. I feel that there is tremendous momentum in our business right now and that our products are dominating their respective segments. Our management team has been working hard to reduce costs, especially for the consolidation of redundant operations resulting from the merger of Apartments.com and Apartment Finder into CoStar. Year-over-year, we have reduced our overall head count 372 from 3,302 to 2,930. One of the ways we did this was by consolidating much of the operations of Apartments.com in Chicago and Washington D.C. into Apartment Finder's lower cost city of Atlanta. I think the team has achieved remarkable efficiency, given that we acquired Apartment Finder this time last year, integrated the operations, built a completely new website, discontinued their print products and ended the quarter with fewer people in our Apartment group than we had before last year's merger with Finder. Such dramatic cost reduction is even more impressive, given that at the same time, we grew Apartment's marketplace revenue 58% year-over-year. Since June 2015, we've essentially stripped away all of the net incremental expenses associated with Apartment Finder, while maintaining $65 million of its revenue. We acquired Apartment Finder last year for $170 million at approximately a 7.4 times EBITDA. Now that we've effectively eliminated their net expense, you could say that it was a 2.6 times EBITDA deal. With strong revenue growth and dramatic cost reductions, we have seen a surge in profitability. EBITDA increased to $46 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to a loss of $1 million in the second quarter 2015. EBITDA margin for the second quarter 2016 was a solid 22%. We are remaining fully committed to achieving $1 billion revenue in 2018 – I'm sorry, yeah, in 2018 and 40% adjusted EBITDA margins exiting 2018. I would like to update you in a bit more detail on our progress in the Apartment sector. Driving traffic to Apartments.com is the core to our success. According to comScore, year-over-year in the second quarter 2016, our Apartment's network achieved a 58% increase in unique visitors and a 103% increase in visits, driving a 24% increase in leads delivered to our clients. The Apartments.com network has nearly 35 million monthly visits in June 2016 as reported by comScore. Our network now has over 12 million more monthly visits than our closest network competitor, RentPath, which includes Apartment Guide and more than 27 million monthly visits more than our next closest competitor, ForRent.com. While the renter traffic to Apartments.com has grown year-over-year, our closest competitor's traffic has fallen off. Among our ILS competitors, Apartments.com is now number one in SEO traffic, SEM traffic, and overall site traffic. We are clearly pulling away from the competitors. Apartments.com traffic dominance is translating into value creation for our customers. Last week, we met with one of our largest customers that manages hundreds of thousands of units across the United States. They track the source of all incoming leads into their apartment communities and how those leads convert into signed leases. They shared with us how the Apartments.com networks perform for their communities. They told us that our network generates more leads and 100% more leases than any competing network. That means our network converted leases at a 94% higher rate than the next competitor, all at half the cost. The fact that we are becoming such a huge source of vital renter leads is not news to me. It's consistent to what I'm hearing from many of our clients. I have, in fact, had clients tell me that we are now generating up to 90% of their leads. In fact, in just two years after the acquisition of Apartments.com by CoStar Group, we have now delivered our 50 millionth lead to property advertisers. We conducted 4,500 Apartments.com customer satisfaction surveys during the second quarter this year. Each customer was asked on a scale of one to 10, how likely they are to recommend Apartments.com to a colleague? On average, our customers responded with a rating of 9.6. We are thrilled to achieve a score that rounds to a 10 on a scale of one to 10. We believe that, not surprisingly, our very significant product advantage is translating into a major shift in market share from our competitors to Apartments.com. We do not have hard or verified numbers on the exact number of properties advertising on our competitors' sites, so I am estimating, but we believe that each of our closest and second closest competitors have lost approximately 3,000 and 9,000 advertising communities, respectively, over the past two years, while we have gained more than 10,000. We also believe that our closest and second closest competitors have lost approximately 2,000 and 1,000 advertisers, respectively, this year alone, driving their revenue down materially. We believe that our competitors are lowering their prices in an attempt to preserve market share. We've increased our average revenue per community to approximately $600 per month. This is up significantly from $435 in June of 2015. Our tiered pricing structure and our quality leads and volume of leads are getting property managers to spend more money with us. We believe that we have moved from being the third-place player in this space when we acquired Apartments.com in 2014 to the clear number one position based on traffic – SEM traffic, SEO, total communities – total advertised communities, leads delivered, growth, and total revenue. Customer service is an important component of success in the apartment marketing space. As we have grown so dramatically over the past two years, we felt that our sales force was falling behind on the relationship-building element required to succeed long-term in the apartment industry. Our sales force has been really busy and having a lot of success with new sales. We wanted to refocus them on customer service. I think it would be a huge mistake over the long-term, if we had the best site but lost share to any competitors because of so-so customer service. As a result, we made customer service priority one for our Apartment sales force this year. We wanted to get face-to-face in front of as many of our clients as we could to tell our very positive and great story and make sure that we built a brand, not just with great technical performance specs, but huge goodwill as well. Since we started that effort earlier this year, we have doubled the number of clients we meet with each month. In February, our team visited 9,000 client sites. By June, that number had more than doubled to 19,000 face-to-face client visits per month. We conducted 45,000 face-to-face apartment industry meetings in the second quarter. We made a strategic decision to build equity with our customers for the long-term and we're willing to forgo a little bit of short-term sales to achieve that. We are making this investment in customer service from a position of strength, not weakness. There's been a tangible pay-off from those tens of thousands of additional meetings. Property management companies sometimes cancel their advertising contracts with us for different reasons and some are unavoidable, such as when a client sells their building, but many cancels are avoided by getting in front of clients regularly. With the most customer contact we have ever had, we have also, not surprisingly, achieved our lowest cancellation rate ever. Our monthly apartment marketplace cancel rate fell close to 1% monthly from an historical rate of 2% to 3% monthly. So, it's less than half of what the historical rate had been. What is really impressive is, since our acquisition of Apartments.com in 2014, we have nearly doubled the number of paying properties and have cut the number of monthly cancels in half. Our entry into the Multifamily space is not only driving advertising revenue, it's also driving strong CoStar information sales. When we acquired and invested in Apartments.com, we took the massive amounts of Multifamily data we began generating and used it to produce Multifamily information within our CoStar information products. This information is useful to property managers who need to set rents, to lenders underwriting loans, to developers studying the feasibility of new apartment buildings, and to people buying or selling apartment buildings. This revenue stream was basically immaterial when we acquired Apartments.com, but has now climbed to $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2016, up $1.3 million from $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. This new $23 million of annualized information revenue is reported under our CoStar information revenue line, not under our Apartments.com or Multifamily revenue line. If you combine the two Multifamily associated revenue streams, we are approaching $243 million of revenue in the Multifamily space or about a $0.75 billion. We have been and will continue to make strategic investments for the long-term growth of our business. We believe that our growing field sales force is more productive and their morale is higher, when we have CoStar group offices in their market that they can work out of and that our clients can visit them in. We opened new sales offices in 10 cities in the second quarter and anticipate opening an additional 17 in the third quarter of 2016. I have to say that we have some advantage in finding good high-quality office space that someone else has built out and we're leasing without the full expense of build out. We have some inside sources there. The new offices will bring together our multiple sales teams from CoStar, Apartments, and LoopNet into an integrated setting, which we believe will accelerate our sales penetration and provide better support to our existing customers. We anticipate continuing to grow our sales force this year and into next year because we believe that we have many more qualified prospects to sell to than our current size sales force can possibly reach. We plan to grow the size of our CoStar, Apartments, Land, business for sale, and LoopNet sales teams by, in combination, approximately 200 staff over the next 18 months. We anticipate opening a major new operations and research center in the coming months, in a lower cost of living city such as Charlotte or Kansas City. We believe that compared to a location that we operate in today such as San Francisco or Washington D.C., these markets will allow us to recruit and retain employees more easily by providing more competitive local salaries to our staff, who could then afford a relatively higher quality of life. We will not be shifting jobs, but more looking to build new hires in these locations. This will cost have higher costs at startup or create higher costs as we start up a new low-cost center, but should produce savings over the intermediate-term and long-term. We are considering organically adding new homes information to the CoStar product in 2017. We believe that we have had a significant competitive advantage in this area, and that the investment would be reasonable compared to the opportunity. We believe that it would be particularly valuable to our lender clients. As mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, in an effort to drive higher customer satisfaction rates for CoStar customers, and this is opposed to the Apartments customers. In order to try to drive higher renewal rates, greater upsells, and indirectly more total sales, we have staffed a new team of approximately 60 CoStar customer service representatives whose job it is to drive more usage and adoption of the CoStar and LoopNet products within our client base and to provide customer service generally. I believe they're making a very positive impact on the business. Before the team was deployed in February of 2016, our sales force conducted a total of 3,600 on-site face-to-face client training sessions. In June of 2016 with a new sevice team in place, we conducted twice that number of client engagements with 7,300 on-site client training sessions. This means we are on pace to build relationships with tens of thousands of CoStar customers, we would not have seen before. While the short story might be that we're doing this because of some sort of problem, similar to our approach in the apartment side of the business, we are, in fact, doing it from position of strength, not weakness. We want to have a large support team in place in preparation for the anticipated demand to train thousands of LoopNet customers, when we accelerate the migration of LoopNet information customers into CoStar next year. So in total, we're meeting with approximately 40,000 more face-to-face sessions each quarter with customers and we're convinced that will have a long-term positive pay off. The single biggest investment we're making right now is in integrating the back ends of LoopNet and CoStar into one unified database. This is a huge project ultimately engaging a thousand plus software developers, designers, researchers, trainers, and sales people. When successfully deployed in early 2017, we believe the project will have a number of important benefits for the company and our customers, including the following: A dramatically higher quality database, a more efficient and lower cost of research, reduction of our customers cost to maintain their listings, a better commercial real estate marketing platform, a reduction in intercompany product cannibalization that we believe costs us tens of millions of revenue annually and better facilitation of sales and upsells of customers into our higher value CoStar information products. Right now, there are tens of thousands of subscribers to LoopNet's lower cost, lower value information products and hundreds of thousands of repeat users of LoopNet's free information services. Our goal is to convert tens of thousands of these clients into much more valuable CoStar subscribers. As we approach sun setting the LoopNet information products, we have dramatically reduced the effort we're putting into selling them and we're in fact shortening the contract terms to month-to-month so that we have the flexibility to eliminate them. And we have long anticipated this and we've communicated it, however, it is causing a significant reduction of LoopNet information revenue. We anticipate that there will be volatility in this LoopNet information revenue as we move through the anticipated conversion in the first quarter 2017. We expect to bring in offsetting positive revenue benefit in the CoStar information product line in 2017 and beyond. In the short run, we believe it makes good sense and we're willing to sacrifice the new sales and information side of the LoopNet business in order to obtain a much larger long-term benefit of having people buy higher value CoStar services. Consumer use at LoopNet continues to be strong. Profile views have increased to 66 million in the second quarter this year, up from 49 million views year-over-year. LoopNet continues to attract the largest unique visitor traffic in the industry by a very, very large margin. For a third year in a row, CoStar has been recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the most innovative growth companies. This year, we ranked number 11 globally, which represents a 16 spot jump from 2015's list. Interestingly, several of the top 20 most innovative growth companies on the list are in the digital real estate space. CoStar was also recently honored at the National Building Museum's Annual Honor Gala, which drew more than 1,000 industry professionals. Quick update on the commercial real estate markets, it looks good. The U.S. commercial real estate markets continue to show strength in the first half of the year. Occupancy rates are now at a business cycle highs for office, industrial, and retail properties and within 20 basis points of those highs for the apartment sector too. Demand for space is still driving rent growth to well-above inflation and ranges from over 6% for industrial properties, down to 2.6% for retail properties. Geographically, the vast majority of U.S. Metros reported improving fundamentals. In the office market, 66% of submarkets reported falling vacancy during the quarter. That is one of the most important statistics, I keep my eye on and is a business cycle high, and 56% of the Metro markets now have higher overall occupancy rates than in the 2006-2007 peak. In the apartment market, 63% of the Metros have higher occupancy rates than the last market peak. This is very significant since apartment construction has doubled over the past four years. So clearly, the key driver of investment returns and occupancy is very strong. The pace of commercial real estate sales have slowed for all property types and sales in the first half of the year fell 28% from the same point in 2015. Despite the slowing sales, the context of this trend is important since 2015 was a record-high year for real estate sales. Additionally, the commercial real estate sales pace is still 70% higher than the 2015 average for the first half of the year and the investment sales market continues to produce value increases. While sales have slowed somewhat, the market remains strong when compared to historical trends. Analysis department market shows this it is becoming increasingly competitive. New construction completions have doubled since 2012, which has led to a 20-basis point rise in apartment vacancy rates since the market cycle low in the same quarter 2015 and annual rent growth slowed to 3.5% from 7.2%,one year ago, still these numbers are very strong. But because the apartment advertising demand is highly correlated with weaker apartment markets, a more competitive apartment market is likely to benefit our apartment ad sales. Office real estate fundamentals remain strong with occupancy at a business cycle high of 89.4% and year-over-year rent growth more than double inflation at 3.9%. Even though rent growth is marginally lower than the 4.2% growth recorded a year ago, the real story is that rent growth is becoming more evenly distributed by Metro. This story of strong demand, high occupancy, and well above inflation rent gains is repeated in other real estate sectors including retail, logistics, light industrial, hospitality, and specialty. So the second quarter of 2016 marked my 30th anniversary since I started the company and our team began leveraging the potential of digitizing real estate markets. It's a number of years. Over the years, CoStar has provided the most comprehensive and accurate data and intelligence in marketing solutions available to professionals involved in every aspect of commercial real estate. Our transformation of the Multifamily information and marketing industry is just the latest iteration of our innovation. I'm very proud to lead a great team of professionals who are accomplishing so much, and have so much potential. Who knows, this might only mark the halfway point of my career. After all, my father was 30 years older than I am today, before he in fact retired. It is possible, I don't think my wife will want to hear that, but it's possible. Mathematically, if CoStar sustained the 20% plus growth rate of the past few years, we could, in fact, report to you $250 billion in revenues in the year I'd reach my next 30th year or my 60th anniversary. That's right, $250 billion in revenues, which is a world record for the largest forward-looking revenue possibility any CEO has ever said in any public earnings call. In the short term, we remain focused on reaching $1 billion in revenues in 2018 with a 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018 or sooner. That's a surer, safer bet. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Scott Wheeler, who is six months into his first 30 years with CoStar.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: All right. Thank you very much, Andy. Looking forward to that next 30 years and the $250 billion.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Only 29.5 years.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Only 29.5 years to go for me. As Andy mentioned, we're pleased with the performance in the second quarter of 2016. Today, I'd like to provide a bit more color on the results in addition to what we've already communicated to you in our second quarter press release, which we sent out yesterday. My comments are going to focus on the financial results, some performance metrics, and then our 2016 outlook. Regarding our financial results, revenue in the second quarter 2016 increased 21% over prior year, which translates into a 15% growth rate on a pro forma basis. These pro forma results include the revenue from Apartment Finder for 2015, net of the revenue streams that we eliminated such as Finder Social. Now, looking at our revenue performance by services, we're very pleased with the acceleration in revenue growth in CoStar Suite from 12.5% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2016 to 13.9% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2016. The acceleration in the growth rate is underpinned by continued strong CMA sales as well as the refocusing of our information sales force back to selling information products following our successful Apartments integration. With this strong performance, we believe that CoStar Suite will continue growing in the 12% to 14% range throughout 2016 as opposed to the 11% to 13% range that we've previously communicated. The information services revenue growth for the second quarter was in the low single digits, as expected. You'll recall that information services includes revenue from our LoopNet information products, LoopNet Searcher, Property Comps and Property Facts, which we are not actively selling in advance of our planned integration of LoopNet and CoStar expected at the end of this year, as Andy was talking about. Accordingly, we expect revenue growth rates in information services to decline throughout the year and turn negative by the fourth quarter in advance of our conversion. In our Multifamily service offerings, our revenue growth rate of 58% year-over-year in the second quarter includes increases in both the number of properties that advertise on our network as well the average revenue per property. In addition, despite removing the requirement to sell only annual contracts in the Multifamily space, our net new sales on annual subscriptions for the Apartments network increased in the second quarter of 2016 versus the first quarter of 2016. Multifamily revenue growth was 24% on a pro forma basis, including revenue from Apartment Finder and net of the revenue streams we eliminated, and is expected to remain in the range of 20% to 25% throughout this year, as previously discussed. Rounding out our services performance, Commercial Property and Land grew 11% year-over-year in the second quarter and remains in the low double-digit growth range expected for the remainder of the year. Now, regarding our profit performance this quarter, we continue to manage our cost structure so that incremental revenue drops through to profit at a very high rate. In the second quarter, over 100% of incremental year-over-year revenue was converted to profit, as our revenue grew 21% and expenses were down 6% year-over-year, as Andy explained. Our gross margin came in at 79.4% in the second quarter, representing an increase of 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2016 and that's an increase of over 500 basis points from the gross margin in the second quarter of 2015. The vast majority of our cost of revenue relates to our research operations, which is comprised of fixed and semi-variable costs. This, of course, enables margins to improve with revenue growth. Our expectation is that our gross margins will continue in this high 70% range this year, as our revenues continue to increase and we continue to invest in our research capabilities. Operating expenses are down $10 million year-over-year as a result of the previous announced plan to reduce our marketing and advertising spend as well as reduce resource levels in the business and the integration of Apartment Finder. Staffing levels are expected to increase throughout the remainder of this year as we had sales resources across all of our major service areas. As a result of our continued strong revenue growth and cost management, our second quarter adjusted EBITDA results are favorable to the second quarter guidance range that we provided in April by $4 million at the midpoint. Of this favorability, $3 million is due to productivity we achieved in our marketing spend that allowed us to meet our marketing objectives with lower spending than anticipated. We plan to redirect the resulting marketing savings to other advertising priorities in the second half of this year. Now, let's take a look at some performance metrics for the quarter. At the end of June 2016, we had 584 salespeople, an increase of around 75 people from the end of March 2016. We added sales resources across all our major service areas with the largest increase in our Apartment sales force. We will continue to add sales resources in the month ahead along with the local offices to support this expansion, as Andy discussed. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts continues to increase. It was $158 million for the second quarter of 2016 or 77% of total revenue, up from 74% in the prior quarter. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2016, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $564 million, which is up 34% from $420 million for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2015. We added $26 million in net bookings in the second quarter of 2016 along with annualized net new sales on annual subscriptions of $23 million. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of net bookings over $25 million and the second highest sales quarter in our history in both CoStar Suite and Multifamily. Although the net bookings are strong, they're down from the record levels achieved in the second quarter of 2015, which is when we launched the new Apartments.com site and a major advertising campaign. In addition, the reduction in LoopNet information sales in the second quarter of 2016, that Andy referenced, also contributed to the decline in net bookings, both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Renewal rates for annual subscription revenue across all service offerings improved slightly as we focused on improving customer service. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for annual subscription-based revenue is now at 90.5% and the 12-month trailing renewal rate for customers who've been with us for five years or longer was 97.3%. I'll now discuss our outlook for the third quarter and the full year of 2016. Our full year 2016 revenue range of approximately $834 million to $840 million remains unchanged and we expect pro forma revenue growth for the year of between 13% to 14%, including Apartment Finder revenues for the relevant periods. Our third quarter revenue range of $211 million to $213 million implies a year-over-year pro forma growth rate of 13% to 14%, while we expect the reported growth rate to look closer to 12% to 13%. This is because we had approximately $2 million of non-core revenue in the third quarter of 2015 and that we have since eliminated. Accordingly, this $2 million needs to be deducted from the third quarter 2015 revenues in your pro forma growth calculations. We continue to see positive trends in our expense profile and are again raising our full year 2016 non-GAAP earnings per share outlook. Our revised range of $4.05 to $4.13 per diluted share is an increase of $0.04 at the mid-point, compared to our prior outlook, and that's up $0.42 from the initial 2016 guidance that we provided in February of this year. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of approximately $1.00 to $1.04, which represents an increase of $0.11 at the mid-point over our second quarter results. This is primarily the result of planned reductions in marketing expenses coinciding with the end of the summer apartment rental season. Given our strong second quarter performance and the investment plans that support the continued growth of this business, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our stated financial goals of $1 billion of revenue in 2018, and exiting that year with 40% adjusted EBITDA margins. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.
Operator: Our first question is from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Hope you're doing well.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Brett.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Brett.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: My question is on the net new annualized bookings and the net new bookings. Just to make sure, I understand, it seems like that was a negative growth, because both the tough growth or (35:11) because of the big-time media spend last 2Q and because of the shutdown or the deemphasizing of the sales of the info products, but we had a lot of questions from folks asking, when will that normalize and when – which should we see that start to get positive again on a year-over-year, or even sequential basis?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And you're referring to the impact of LoopNet Premium Searcher, Premium Comps and Property Facts or ...?
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think two things is what you guys said that, and then also just the tough comp because you had so much media spend in 2Q last year?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. And then the shutdown of the Finder Social, and non-core revenue. So the LoopNet information products will remain volatile through the first quarter of 2017 for sure. And again we're in a position where we do not want to artificially try to accelerate or intervene to accelerate sales of a product we intend to discontinue before long. So that will – and we don't want to begin aggressively converting LoopNet customers to CoStar Suite until we have 100% of all LoopNet content available within CoStar Suite so there is no reservation factor for a convertee.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we anticipate that being first quarter 2017. So we would begin looking to report a clear consistent progress with that in second quarter 2017.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Great.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Did you want to add anything to that latter part of that, Scott?
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Keep in mind that as we transfer to CoStar Suite, you'll see that growth obviously in the CoStar Suite sector. And so, if you're looking really at only information services then as you'd expect, that's going to continue to decline as we get the more of the value shifted into the CoStar Suite sector.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And over the long-term it would go to zero and hopefully be transitioned over to CoStar.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you. Just a follow-up on that discussion. Could you size the amount of revenue that you expect to effectively eventually go away by the first quarter of 2017 and do you think you'll be able to recover all of that into CoStar Suite during 2017 and is this any different from what you've been talking about previously around doing some sort of hybrid product between LoopNet and CoStar?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It is not different, it's what we've been talking about for, I guess gosh, I hate to say it, but two years now.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, quite a while.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But ...
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: It's getting there.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so the PCPF component, the Property Comps, the Property Facts component which is immediately impacted in the first quarter is what ...
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, it's about $35 million to $40 million.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The total is $35 million to $40 million. And then the (38:24) is probably $18 million or so, roughly. And so the $18 million – and then the other part, we basically phase out. The half that we phase out over probably an 18-month cycle beginning in the first quarter 2017, but we do that prioritizing the most likely to convert and upsell first and our goal would be to be able to show a net overall uptick in revenue during the course of 2017 from that effort, but again we look at it. It's only estimating, you're just trying to make an estimate with your best belief. I'm pretty darn confident that it represents up to a $50 million cannibalization of the higher value products and it represents an upsell opportunity of $250 million. So I think, again it can't be known, but it's in the $200 million to $300 million positive range, and I think that would be captured over five years to 10 years overall.
Operator: Thank you. Next in queue is Brandon Dobell with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon B. Dobell - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. I just want to make sure I connect two dots here. First, the number of salespeople you're adding through, I guess, the balance of this year into 2017. How that will fit with – I guess it's the changes you're making in advance of combining the LoopNet and CoStar databases to really push the CoStar information suite. How do those two things align, and is there some connection between that answer and how we should think about the net new number the next two quarters or three quarters?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as you know, growing the sales force in the next two quarters does not grow the revenue in the next two quarters dramatically Now, we do have some pent-up growth already in the Apartment side. So, we probably have in the range of 30 folks to 40 folks in the pipeline to be added to productive sales or production sales for apartments that will go online in the third quarter and fourth quarter. So we have about 30 people to 40 people that will become productive in the third quarter or fourth quarter in the Apartment side. We'll probably see some benefit from that. The information LoopNet side will be a little bit slower. And then, we're going to bring on a second component later in the year, where we're creating 40 hunter territories in the Apartment side. And again, then they probably won't really be – their work will not be visible to the first quarter 2017. But that growth in cost is already reflected in our earnings guidance and in the raising the earnings guidance for the year. So, we're reinvesting some of the outsized beat for the year.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: And what's encouraging about this, Brandon, as you look at our sales head count that is obviously down 50 plus heads from where we were last year at this time. And even with that we achieved second highest sales quarters in both Multifamily and CoStar even at these depleted levels. So, we're really encouraged that the effectiveness, if you look at the productivity of the sales force on an individual basis has grown dramatically between now and a year ago. And so, that's definitely encouraging for us and we'll underpin the plans to want to continue to grow sales as that productivity is still rising.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The productivity, especially in the Apartment side is really quite impressive. And I'd also say that, just to give you some color on that, it's always tough to pull together two equal-sized sales forces into one and then restructure it all in the course of a quick 12 months. I'd have to say I just completed – last week I completed a two-day – our bimonthly two-day apartment sales manager meeting. And the group is really cohesive now and stable, and really rowing in the – pulling in the same direction, I think really strong. So we can see that we have – we're reaching 80% of our clients each quarter, which is a mandatory thing. And – but we only have enough feet on the street to reach about 15% of our prospects each quarter which is just lost revenue opportunity. And we're – when we meet with a – when we do have a demo with someone who is marketing their apartment building, we have about a 30% close rate. So, given that we can only reach 15% of the prospects, we want to reach 100% of the prospects each quarter, hence we're scaling the sales force a little bit.
Operator: Next in queue is Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, this is (43:37) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. Just quickly about the Apartments.com unique visitors in relation that you gave on the release. Does that include the new traffic from Move.com and Realtor.com? If you can just give us more color on that, so, that we can give more of an apples-to-apples comparison from a year-over-year standpoint. That would be really helpful. Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. It does include that Move.com traffic, Realtor.com traffic as well. I'd have to say that that is not a large driver. I don't have exactly a number, but I know that it represents, gosh – it represents a little less than 4.5% of our lead flow. So, one of the things is that a residential site like that, a site that's got both residential and for rent on it, drives dramatically less lead flow of like a fraction of the lead flow of the dedicated Apartment site drives and then it also has a lower conversion rate. So it's not the meaningful driver of that story. One of the things that was a remarkable benchmark this quarter was that Apartments.com, one site, not the whole network of sites – Apartments.com one site beat the unique visitors of our second closest competitors' four or five sites combined. So it's really where we thought this would be more of a story of a network of sites, the Apartments.com traffic is pulling so far ahead that it's really just about Apartments.com.
Operator: Next in queue is Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Bill.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So the $250 billion figure, is that a full year number or is that a run rate exiting 2046?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Third quarter.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Third quarter. Okay.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Third quarter. But we might revise that.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Guide upward on that number.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, now the real question. On the Apartment sales force, if you could help me understand again, how big is it now and how long before you get to parity with the CoStar Suite sales force?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's – by head count to-date on our payroll it's in parity. But 35 of them, let's say, 30 to 40 of them are still in training or just coming out of training. And that training period includes maybe currently four weeks to five weeks of training, and then a mandatory no-sell period of about three weeks to four weeks where they have to visit 100% of the clients in their territory. So it's about a two months to three months phase-up. And so – but they'll all start coming on line in this quarter and the following quarter. And then, we would have a larger sales force in the Apartments.com side of the house in the – coming in the first quarter of 2017 as we add another 10 account managers and then 40 hunters.
Operator: And next in queue is Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Andre. How're you doing?
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Andre.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good, good. So, I just want to talk a little bit about the core Suite. I know there's a lot of focus on Apartments and the LoopNet up sell, but with the headline number for growth in the Suite, could you talk a little bit about how much of that is driven by underlying user or number of corporations, or teams growing relative to pricing. And then, similarly, the year-over-year growth was about $12 million. How much of that is from the broker-client space that most people are traditionally focused on versus the institutional investors in other buckets you're trying to grow?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I would say that not a lot of it is – there's not much of it coming from price increases. So, we have – I would say it's inflation, sub-inflation, two points, three points depending on which inflation you're using. So, it's really an expansion of the client base and new logos coming on board. A little bit of – like I think there was a big Bank of America deal where they were expanding the number of heads in there, but a lot of its coming from people who are buying Multifamily information services from us in CoStar. So, a lot of business is coming from banks and lenders. We are making good progress with folks like Fannie Mae and some other organizations in that side of the world. So, a lot of its institutional owner, but we're still adding brokers. But the real season for focusing on the brokerage industry is in Q1 2017, once we do the LoopNet conversion. So we still have tens of thousands of brokerage firms who want to add to the client base and the real push on that happens next year. Did that answer your question, or what did I leave out there?
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Nope. That was it. Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Next in queue is Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.
Natasha Asar - JMP Securities: Yeah, hi. This is Natasha on for Pat. We were just wondering what ...
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Natasha.
Natasha Asar - JMP Securities: Hi.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You could be Pat.
Natasha Asar - JMP Securities: What is the appetite for M&A, in particular for property management software solutions like RealPage or Yardi?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: RealPage, Yardi. I've never heard of them.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: We should look them up.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We should look that up...no, I'm teasing. Those are – I'd have to say those are some great companies; huge customer presence, mission critical functions to those industries. And you could put MRI in there; you could put Entrata in there, but they're also very complex and they don't move share very quickly. So, I would say that in the apartment marketing space, there's been a lot of share shift. We're telling you that we believe there's a lot of share shift in the last two years. It wouldn't move like that in the Multifamily property accounting space. It is developed over 30 years to 40 years, that kind of share, and people don't – switch costs are very high moving from one system to another. We think it's more advantageous to have a positive 'coop-etition' with those players and there is an unlimited number of things we can be doing on the revenue generation side for the industry right now, without getting into direct competition with one or another of those folks. So we're open to different things. We're more focused on the revenue generation side of the business right now. We're lazy. We don't like to work hard. So... Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next name in queue is Ian Corydon with B. Riley & Co.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thank you. You talked about some of the trends you're seeing in the apartment space with respect to absorption and rent growth. I'm curious what kind of conditions would have to occur before you might get concerned that advertising spend might actually contract for the apartment space?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the thing that would worry me more is dramatically lower vacancy rates, and I don't think that's what's going to happen. Both in the CoStar information business and the Apartments business, when vacancy rates start moving to 1% and 2%, there's no such thing as marketing. The nice thing in the Multifamily spaces are such high churn though that people want to maintain that lead flow and they can in fact, push rents, but I'm more concerned about ultra-low vacancy rates. I'm less concerned about vacancy rates expanding. So, if vacancy rates expanded to the 10% rate, I think you would see a lot of bankruptcies occur. And if that happens, there's plenty of capital in the world. There is overall a fundamental housing shortage in the United States, residential housing shortage, so the capital would flow in and the new capital would come in at a lower cost base and stable balance sheet and would aggressively market to fill those vacancies. That's our view and I think we would have a painful time seeing any of our customers lose their properties, but we would come out of it and it would cause short-term friction. It could be a 90-day cycle where the property drops off, before it comes back on, but we would benefit. The one thing that I think is happening right now and again I'm only estimating, but we watch it carefully, I think one of things that is happening now is that over the past five years or six years, I believe apartment communities used to maintain substantial advertising contracts with multiple ILSs for the same property. I think that people are beginning to reduce the number of ILSs they use and that's because of these super-low vacancy rates. Fortunately, our product is strong enough that they're choosing our ILS as the one to remain with to the best of my knowledge. So big picture, I am not, I'm more concerned as a taxpayer what it might to do to bailout programs and deficit than I am to what it does to Apartments.com advertising spend.
Operator: Our last question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No problem there. Always, we do that.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, Andy, you mentioned a nice lift in apartment community revenue yield or revenue per community and it seems that that reflects pricing to value. You also mentioned, I think that some of your competition is now perhaps cutting price in order to take share in a competitive environment. It would seem that given the value add and the quality of the data, et cetera that CoStar is in a position where it could actually start to price to value more effectively. Is that something that we could see drive revenue growth over time in the Apartments business?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Certainly, so one of the things we intentionally did is when we selected Apartments.com as the first company we wanted to merge with, we made it a point to select the lowest cost provider. We wanted to have the group with a lowest cost point on the belief that if nobody had more than 10% share of the market and you have a fixed brand development marketing budget line, you're better off going in there at lower cost and trying to achieve much higher volume, and if other people play a high price point game and have lower volume and can't invest in branding, they're in a tough place. So, we like being somewhat aggressive, and we like taking share. You said – you mentioned one thing that our competitors are reducing price to take share, I think they're reducing price to hold share. I believe they're losing significant share, I think they're losing shocking share. So, we would, I mean I do believe that's there. When we get major customers who we value telling us the kinds of things they're telling us about, the kind of lead flow we're generating comparatively and the fact that our cost per lease is less than half of the competitors. Yeah, we certainly have pricing power, but I would like to see us get to 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 paid properties before we considered pricing to value. But the other nice thing is we're not raising people's prices, we have these multiple tiers. And so, companies can choose where they need to be for lead flow, and we might be aggressive in the silver and gold, the lower categories on pricing there, but we can hold and raise pricing in platinum and diamond. And then, people who really need lead flow and want to soar to the top and be the most prominent, especially new construction projects. Those prices would start to be – would probably start to reach some of the highest price points people have seen, but the main goal is share. The main goal is just getting more and more communities involved. Remember, also that the more communities we get digitally feeding to us, the higher quality information products, we're producing. So we are now running at something like 17,500 communities, electronically connected to us, digitally feeding content to us, typically on a daily or multi-hour basis. So we're trying to get volume, and we're making good progress there, obviously, having almost double the number of properties in the last two years. I think that was, yes or no, you're looking for, I'm sorry for the four paragraphs.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think we have one more question. No? We're all set. Well, thank you everybody. We appreciate you joining us in the second quarter earnings call and I look forward to talking to you on the third quarter.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference service. You may now disconnect.

Andrew Florance: Thank you, Rich, for a fantastic warm-up act.
Richard Simonelli: You’re welcome.
Andrew Florance: Good morning and thank you all for joining us for CoStar Realty’s first quarter 2016 financial results call. We had an excellent first quarter, as we continue to grow revenue while we are focusing on reducing costs and driving margin expansion. We generated excellent top line growth of 26% year-over-year, reaching $200 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2016, annualized that would be an $800 million rate. We generated net bookings of $30 million in the first quarter of 2016 with solid performances from both CoStar and our Apartments network. CoStar Suite, which represents 50% of our total revenue, grew 12.5% from the first quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016, and 4.4% sequential quarterly, quarter-over-quarter. For each of the past four quarters, we have been averaging over $30 million in quarterly bookings, which is double our 2014 quarterly bookings, which were approximately $15 million per quarter. We increased net new sales on annual subscriptions 53% year-over-year to $25 million in the quarter, and achieved our highest quarter ever of net new sales for CoStar Information Services. With these strong sales and a consistent focus on cost control, we increased EBITDA 234% year-over-year from $14 million in the first quarter of 2015 to $48 million in the first quarter of 2016. In that period, our EBITDA margin rose from 9% to 24%. With a $41 million increase in revenue over the same time period, this indicates 82% of our revenue flowing through to EBITDA. This dramatic EBITDA expansion is all the more impressive, given that it was achieved in the same quarter we invested aggressively in our first Super Bowl commercial. We are moving swiftly to rationalize down the headcount required to effectively run the newly integrated operations of CoStar and the Apartment network. We have 450 fewer employees today than we did in June of 2015. We will reallocate a portion of those headcount savings into other important positions, where we need to invest for growth. In total, we saved approximately $20 million just in annual printing costs by shutting down the Apartment Finder print guides and finder social. I believe we have significant additional opportunities to find even more cost savings over the year to come. We expect our 2016 focus on the integration of LoopNet and CoStar databases will give us another good opportunity to drive higher revenue, while simultaneously reducing costs. CoStar Market Analytics, which we launched in March of 2016, now has delivered over $25 million in sales. This is an enhanced version of CoStar Suite and it’s been extremely popular with apartment property managers and lenders. We are looking to expand the offering of CoStar Market Analytics over the course of the year with new enhancements for the Office, Industrial and Retail segments. I’m happy to report that we have successfully completed converting clients of our acquired legacy Focus Products in the United Kingdom to CoStar Suite. After 20-plus years in the role of the primary commercial real estate information product for the UK, Focus is no more. As of March, Suite revenues in the UK were 76% higher than those achieved by Focus at its peak. This reflects the fact that, we achieved both significant price appreciation and increased share during that migration. This is our third country on a fully integrated commercial real estate data model in a unified CoStar product. We expect to see another incremental sales driver when we complete the back-end integration of the LoopNet database and to begin to move users to the higher-value CoStar Information Services. The technology integration is going well, and I believe that you will see strong revenue lift in the migration in 2017 and 2018. I believe the migration of LoopNet Premium Searcher comps and facts users to higher-value CoStar services will take less time and result in higher up-sells based on our success and learning in the United Kingdom. Revenue for our online apartment marketplaces in Q1 grew 100% year-over-year, with pro forma organic revenue growth of 24% year-over-year. Sales have been very strong, and we are now moving into the prime rental season. In the first quarter 2016, we continued to expand Apartments.com’s lead in unique visitors and consumer engagement versus other apartment rental Internet listing sites. Apartments.com achieved the number one position among other apartment rental websites in unique visitors, monthly visits, total page views, total time on site, average time on site, consumer engagement, lowest bounce rate, unaided awareness, search engine marketing, and number of apartment buildings offered. The Apartments.com site had 7.7 million unique visitors in March, 27% higher than our nearest direct competitor. Similar, total views of Apartments.com were 60% higher than the nearest direct competitor site in March. We have already built significant momentum and started 2016 off strongly with our successful Apartments.com Super Bowl ad. With the return of peak rental seasons in the middle of March, we resumed an intensive advertising campaign for our Apartments.com network. The television campaign component includes television ads in prime time, on cable, in syndication, and during supports and select finals like The Walking Dead and The Voice. Once again, our TV commercials featured Jeff Goldblum as Brad Bellflower. The new ads were directed by Bob Odenkirk, who you may know for his work with Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. There are a number of brand commercials that highlight the benefits of Apartments.com. They emphasize the breadth of our inventory, ease of use, loads of information, all to help consumers find the perfect apartment. The ads also feature our mobile app prominently. In the first quarter 2016, 57% of traffic to Apartments.com originated from a mobile device or app. A second set of spots celebrate the joys of renting an apartment over the crippling debt and maintenance torture associated with homeownership. With more Americans every day making the wise choice to rent, there are now 110 million U.S. renters, and we believe that the ads will resonate with these renters and have a positive brand halo effect with our apartment manager/owner clients. The brands are really fun, I mean, these spots are really fun. They point out the benefits of renting versus owning in a humorous way. The third set of spots targets the millions of property managers, realtors, and small owners with just one or a few rental listings and encourages them to market their rentals to the millions of renters searching on Apartments.com. Renters have told us clearly that they would love a site with full selection of rentals from apartment buildings, houses, condos and town homes. We believe that if we build more content, we will get more renters searching on our site, and that means, more communities advertising on our site. You will recall in 2015, we announced our exclusive agreement with Move, Inc. to power listings and apartment buildings with 50 or more units on Move’s network of websites, which includes Realtor.com, Move.com and Doorsteps.com. We now promote our advertisers’ communities across six major apartment and real estate rental websites with a single point of contact at prices we believe are on average well-below the prices our largest competitors in the apartments listing space charge. This was the first quarter of our partnership with the Move network of sites. In the first quarter of 2016, we used Move.com to deliver an incremental additional 117 million page views for our advertisers. Our industry-leading Apartment network coupled with more exposure on the Move network creates the best place on the Internet for property managers to reach the most consumers. According to, again, comScore, our Apartment network combined with the Move network generated nearly 12 million unique visitors in March, which is number one among apartment listing sites or networks. Unique visitors are an important traffic metric, but we want consumers to keep coming back to our site. In March, we had over 34 million total visits to our combined network with Move.com, which is nearly 50% more than the biggest competitor, the RentPath network. The average time for visits to a site in our network is nearly 15 minutes per visitor, which is over 30% more time per visitor than RentPath. Our network had over 50% more page views than the RentPath network in March. Overall, that is an amazing 8.5 million hours renters spent searching Apartments.com – searching for apartments on our sites in March. I think our deal with Move has delivered very strong results and much more. As you may have heard, Move has sued Zillow for $1.7 billion in a theft of trade secrets lawsuit. Thanks to our friends at Move and National Association of Realtors, you can watch live streaming video of Zillow’s top executives’ truly zany defenses against allegations that they intentionally destroyed evidence in the case. I think it’s nothing short of the best entertainment Rupert Murdoch’s Media Empire has ever delivered. You can – you really should watch the testimony, or at least read the transcripts at Inman.com. You heard it here first. We have added over $100 million of revenue and thousands of new clients to our Apartments network over the past year. We wanted to be careful not to get too far out over our skis and make sure that we are still delivering excellent customer service, and not just great leads for our customers. And in that effort, we have communicated clearly to our apartment sales force a major emphasis on visiting with clients – existing clients and ensuring that they are receiving excellent service and communication. There is a short-term trade-off in new sales. But we believe that refocusing on great service will drive stronger overall results across this year. In the interest of winning business away from competitors, we have de-emphasized annual contracts for apartment advertising a bit. As we bring on an unprecedented numbers of new advertisers, almost none of them have ever committed to annual contracts before on alternative advertising sites. I think it’s more important to win them over to our site than to insist on annual contracts when they first sign up. In order to do this, we are raising the price for a three-month contracts and offering discounts for committing to annual contracts. We believe it will accomplish the same goal over the intermediate term. LoopNet remains the number one destination on the Internet for brokers and owners to advertise commercial real estate properties for sale and lease. It’s a great way for brokers to generate leads and for owners to have their properties move more quickly with five million unique visitors coming to the site per month. In order to improve the user experience and create even more speed and efficiency in generating more transactions, we have updated the LoopNet website and introduced tiered pricing similar to Apartments.com. We’re seeing some good results from our upgraded LoopNet site, including increased search activity. Total searches and total searches per unique visitor are up over 60%. Profile views are up 18%, and leads have increased 20%. We believe searchers are getting more utility from LoopNet than ever before. I believe that our LoopNet product can achieve significantly higher growth rates if we invest into – more into sales resources for the LoopNet product. Over the past year or so, CoStar and Apartments.com have drawn sales resources away from the LoopNet product. We are now focusing to increase the number of salespeople dedicated to the LoopNet product. With subscription sales, you always have some churn and have to devote some percentage of our sales force to replacing business lost to churn each month. As you increase sales resources, you do not necessarily increase churn in the short run. New sales resources just increase gross sales. The benefit is that, it’s possible to increase sales resources by X percent and possibly increase net revenue growth by three times X percent. We plan to focus many of these new sales resources on the commercial real estate owner marketing opportunity. LoopNet has traditionally been sold to brokers. A broker in a typical transaction might earn $6,000 from which they must pay for the LoopNet ad. The owner in the very same transaction could receive $376,000, and would be in a better position to pay more for enhanced exposure to get the deal done faster and realize the economic value. When we will sell a property – when we see a property ad to an owner rather than a broker, we typically achieve per-property ad prices 20 times higher. Looking ahead, as I mentioned on our call in February, our single-highest priority in 2016 is to complete the integration of back ends of CoStar and LoopNet. Our software development teams are working hard to accomplish this mission, which we believe will lead to better data quality, lower costs at CoStar, service integration, and up-selling beginning in 2017. In preparation for a major conversion of LoopNet clients over to the CoStar platform over the next 24 months, we have dramatically increased our investment in field customer relationship managers. We have added approximately 50 relationship managers during the first quarter. I believe that this team will have a big impact on driving more usage of our products, improving customer service, increasing renewal rates, and facilitating more up-selling and cross-selling activity. This new team visited 1,150 clients’ offices this past week to conduct product trainings. That increases the number of client trainings we are conducting in a typical week by approximately 400%. It is an investment that I think will pay off in the future. CoStar is committed to working aggressively to protect our intellectual property from theft. Two or three earnings calls ago, I mentioned that we had caught a competitor red-handed stealing our content. In March, we resolved our lawsuit against RealMassive with them agreeing to pay CoStar $1 million. In addition, the federal court entered a sweeping injunction requiring a dramatic change in their business model. Under the court order, RealMassive now has to pre-filter content submitted to their platform for infringement of CoStar IP, before anything can be posted to their site. And they will have to pay additional damages if infringing content is discovered on their site in the future. In the litigation, we have uncovered what we believe to be a very damning evidence of just how systematic the theft of our content actually was. So rather than engage in a long drawn-out suit, we decided to take their $1 million offer to settle the issue and move on to the next item on our list. We are all for fair competition, but theft is not competition. The nation’s real estate markets continued to achieve favorable results in the first quarter 2016. Occupancy rates are now at a business-cycle high for industrial and retail. And they are actually very close to those highs for the apartment and office sectors. Strong demand for space continues to drive rent growth to well-above inflation and ranges from over 6% for industrial properties to near 3% for retail. Geographically, the vast majority of U.S. metros reported improving fundamentals. Within the office market, more than half of the submarkets recorded quarter-over quarter improvement in occupancy, that’s really important. And also, more than half of the 54 major metros now have occupancy rates above the 2006/2007 peak. There is also strength in the construction industry now more than doubled what it was just four years ago, which is a trend that significantly benefits our clients. Investment sales did decline about 17% in the first quarter from one year earlier. But since 2015 was an all-time record year for real estate sales, the first quarter sales pace is still 80% over the long-term average. As we reported last quarter, the apartment market is increasingly competitive due to high levels of supply. In fact, new units underway today represent a very large 4% increase on an annualized basis, and represent a level of construction which is nearly double that of the other property types. This has caused rent growth to slow to 5.1%, as we move into the strong peak season here over the 7%, oh, I’m sorry, over 7% along with a 20% – 20-basis point rise in vacancy from the business cycle low with further increases in vacancy expected. But because apartment advertising demand is highly correlated to weaker apartment markets, a more competitive apartment market is likely to benefit apartment ad sales. For office, real estate fundamentals remained strong with rent growth and occupancy within 10 basis points of the market peak in Q4 2015. The story of strong demand, high occupancy and well-above-average investment sales volumes is repeated in other real estate sectors, including retail, logistics, light industrial, hospitality and specialty. The broad-based strength in real estate activity has helped attract increased demand for CoStar products and services. I’m very pleased with our strong results in the first quarter 2016. I believe that the strong first quarter sales hitting $800 million annualized for the first time, along with increasing cost savings puts us on solid trajectory to reach a margin approaching the mid-30s in the fourth quarter. We believe these results show that we are clearly on our way to achieving our stated goal of $1 billion in revenue and 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler: Great. Thank you, Andy. So as Andy mentioned, we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter 2016. We were able to deliver both solid top line growth and year-over-year margin improvement, while at the same time continuing to fund the important growth investments in sales, marketing, and new services. In the first quarter of 2016, we delivered a 26% increase in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2015. On a pro forma basis, our year-over-year revenue growth was 14% for the first quarter. Now, because this is the first time that we are presenting our revenue by services, it’s important to take a few minutes to explain this new information in a little more detail. You can find the new Revenue by Services schedule in both our press release, as well as our soon-to-be filed SEC Form 10-Q. Now, a number of you asked for additional revenue information following our year-end results. So we prepared the data, along with five quarters of trended information to help you understand our business, as well as the direction of travel. Our new revenue disclosures are built around the two main categories that we’ve discussed in the past, the first being information and analytics, and the second being our online marketplaces. Within each of these categories, we’ve further broken down the revenues to provide insight to our primary service offerings. First off, in information and the analytics category, is our flagship commercial real estate service CoStar Suite, which represents approximately 50% of our Q1 revenues. CoStar Suite is comprised of both the North America and the UK, including CoStar Property, CoStar COMPS, CoStar Tenant, CoStar Portfolio Strategy, and the CoStar Market Analytics. Essentially all the revenue in this category is on 12-month subscription and has a very high renewal rate. Our strategy is to continue investing in our information and analytics services within the CoStar Suite, like the CoStar Market Analytics services for office and industrial and retail that Andy mentioned. We expect the continued growth of this sector in the 11% to 13% range. Next also in the information and analytics category are our Information Services lines. These represent approximately 10% of our Q1 revenue. Information Services includes LoopNet Premium Searcher, Facts and Comps, CoStar Real Estate Manager, CoStar Risk Analytics COMPASS, and a number of other information service capabilities, which we either acquired directly or as parts of other acquisitions. There are a variety of revenue models at play here, most of which are subscription revenue with terms ranging from one to 12 months, along with consulting services and software. We have strategies in place to grow a number of these services, for example, the LoopNet search integration and migration that we’ve talked about previously, while some other services might not play a prominent role in our strategy going forward. Accordingly, we expect the revenue from Information Services to provide flat to low single-digits growth for the remainder of 2016. Now, let’s switch over to our online marketplaces category. Our Multifamily marketplaces include revenue from advertisers that list with us across our complete network of apartment sites, including Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder, ApartmentHomeLiving, Realtor.com, Move.com, and Doorsteps.com full networks. Our Multifamily marketplace revenue was approximately 20% – 25% of total revenues in Q1, and it grew 100% compared to Q1 of last year. On a pro forma basis, as Andy mentioned, our year-over-year Multifamily revenue growth was approximately 24% in the first quarter. This came in at the upper end of the 20% to 25% range that we’ve provided in the February earnings call. Revenue in this category is almost all subscription-based with contract terms ranging from one to 12 months. And we’ll continue to move more of our clients to annual agreements over time. As you are aware, our strategy is to continue to aggressively invest and grow our Multifamily marketplace capabilities in the years ahead. Finally, also in the online marketplaces category are Commercial Property and Land marketplaces, which grew 10.5% year-over-year in the first quarter. Commercial Property and Land marketplaces are comprised mainly of our commercial property-related marketing sites, LoopNet Premium Lister, Showcase and CityFeet. These sites represent approximately 80% of the revenue in this category. The remaining revenue is made up of LandsofAmerica, LandAndFarm, BizBuySell, and BizQuest online marketing sites. Revenue in this category is almost all subscription-based, and is sold to our direct and indirect sales channels, as well as through our online e-commerce tools. Our strategy is to continue investing in our Commercial Property and Land marketplaces, which in the current year involves integrating LoopNet with our CoStar database and tool sets. Growth in this area is expected in the low double-digits for the remainder of the year. And we hope these further revenue details will be useful in understanding the business, and we’ll intend to continue providing Revenue by Services each quarter going forward. Regarding our profit performance this quarter, we continued to manage our cost structure, so that incremental revenue drops through to profit at a very high rate. In Q1, over 80% of our incremental year-over-year revenue was converted to profit. There is three important components of our cost performance here to highlight. First, our gross margin reached an all-time high of 79% of revenue, an increase from the 71% gross margin reported last year in the first quarter, and a sequential 200 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2015. Most notably, our revenue increased by over $40 million year-over-year, while our costs of revenue decreased by over 5%. This inverse revenue-cost relationship is clearly very effective in delivering profit improvements. Secondly, resourcing levels have come down by approximately 450 employees since last June, as Andy mentioned, the result of efficiencies from our integration of acquisitions and other cost-control activities. And third, the success of these cost management activities allows us to sustain a high level of advertising and other investments and still grow our margins. For prospective, our ad investments in the first quarter of 2016 were at the same level as our investment in advertising last year, when we launched the new Apartments.com website. It’s very important we continue to reduce costs through productivity and shift these savings to investments. EBITDA was $48 million for the first quarter of 2016, increase of $34 million, or the 234% versus $14 million in the first quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA also increased $34 million from $24 million in first quarter of 2015 to $58 million for the first quarter of 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 29%, up from 15% in the first quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA results are favorable to the Q1 guidance range we provided in February by $14 million at the midpoint. The majority of the favorability is the result of the effective headcount management and successfully reducing non-critical spending. The rest of the earnings favorability approximately $6 million, or $0.12 per share on a non-GAAP basis was due in equal parts to a shift in timing of marketing expenditures to later in the year, as well as one-time expense reductions in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter was $31 million, or $0.95 per diluted share. Net income in the first quarter of 2016 was $17 million, an increase of $23 million versus a net loss of $6 million reported in the first quarter of 2015. Turning now to a few operating metric highlights, revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was $149 million for the first quarter of 2016, or 74% of total revenue, which is up from 70% in the prior quarter. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2016, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $517 million, up 28% from the $405 million for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2015. This reflects our continued success in growing annual subscriptions primarily within our CoStar Suite and our Multifamily marketplace clients. The renewal rates for our annual subscriptions revenue remained stable. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for subscription-based revenue is at 90.1%, and the 12-month trailing renewal rate for customers who have been with us for five years or longer was 96.2%. At the end of March, we had approximately 510 salespeople, a decline of around 25 people from last year, as we continued the integration of our Multifamily sales force. We recently increased our hiring of new salespeople to cover new sales territories and have our single-largest sales training class underway here in Washington as we speak. As we grow our sales force throughout the year, we’ll also be opening 25 to 30 new sales offices in select markets throughout the country to build local market presence and stay close to our clients. I’ll now discuss our outlook for the second quarter and the full-year of 2016. For the full-year of 2016, we expect revenue of approximately $834 million to $840 million, or 17% to 18% growth over the 2015 results. On a pro forma basis, revenue is expected to grow 13% to 14% for the year. Based on our strong first quarter sales and revenues, we are raising the full-year revenue guidance by $2 million at the midpoint of the range. This outlook assumes continued strong growth in the CoStar Suite in the 11% to 13% range, and a pro forma growth in the range of 20% to 25% for the online Multifamily marketplaces. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect revenue of approximately $204 million to $206 million, representing total growth of around 20%. We’re also raising our earnings guidance for the year, given our exceptional profit results in Q1. We now expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $4 to $4.10 for the year 2016, an increase of $0.38 at the midpoint from the prior outlook we provided in our February call. Based on this new and improved guidance, the midpoint of our 2016 non-GAAP net income range is approximately double the 2015 results. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of approximately $0.80 to $0.84. This includes a $6 million to $7 million increase in our total marketing spend from the Q1 levels, as we enter the peak apartment rental season. This equates to approximately $0.11 to $0.13 of non-GAAP net income per share. Marketing expenses are expected to decline sequentially in both the third and the fourth quarter, as was the case last year. As a result, we’ll see a step-up in earnings in Q3, and then again in Q4, exiting the year with margins in the mid-30% range. So in summary, I’m pleased with our financial results in the first quarter. I look forward to reporting continued progress throughout the year. We believe our sales trends and sustained focus on expense management has us well-positioned to achieve our stated financial goal of $1 billion in revenue in 2018, and exiting that year with 40% adjusted EBITDA margins. Having said all of that, we will now open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll first go to the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.
Sara Gubins: Hi, thank you. I was hoping to get some more color on the strategy that you mentioned within Multifamily to have yourself people make sure that they’re spending some more time with existing clients. Did you see changes in retention trends? Were they worse than you expected? I’m wondering what drove you to decide to do that. And I know that you reiterated the 20% to 25% growth forecast. But I’m wondering, if there is any additional resources that you need to put in order to get that, or if you see any risk, given the increased focus on retention? Thanks.
Andrew Florance: Yes. So the increased focus on retention is just common – for me, it’s just common sense from a lot of experience selling subscription-oriented products over the decades. And we try to stay very close to our customers in the industry. And we do a lot of market research, we do a lot of focus group work. And it’s just clear that we had a great year here. We’ve done a lot. We’ve rapidly integrated Finder into the fold, done the Move deal, we’ve just been very busy. And it’s just very important that we build it – the apartment industry is a little bit more of a relationship-oriented industry. It’s just important that our salespeople know their customers well and aren’t always focusing 90% of their time on trying to find another piece of revenue. And so I think it’s just a lifecycle in the flow of the business here. We need to make sure we establish those relationships. Now, we did move to a much more efficient territory system at the turn of the year, where we went from alphabetical assignment of accounts in major cities to geography-based accounts, which means that a lot of people have new account representatives from Apartments.com and have not met them before, just because of these shifts in territories. So it is important that we take some time and really get out there and make sure that they’re meeting all of these people, and it is a referral-oriented business. The good news is, what we are hearing in these focus groups is that hands-down, we have the best lead flow that they are – we have the best name recognition by far. But that needs to be coupled with good customer service. And it can’t always be, did I get the most amount of money today out of that client relationship? It’s got to be, did I get the most amount of that money out of that client relationship over five years, and still remain good friends? So and then on the – in terms of investing to get more out of it, we might incrementally increase the size of the sales force slightly. But not because we’re trying – not because we think that’s the necessary thing to get to the goal we’ve stated. It’s just because we may have more good prospects to address than the number of salespeople we have can possibly reach. So we continuously evaluate that. And if we think there is more opportunity there like we really believe there is with LoopNet, we’ll invest and we’ll keep you up-to-date on that. But, again, the – as we pull down that headcount dramatically, I mean, so that down 450 year-over-year year, or from June to this quarter includes the increase of 50. That’s a net number after the increase of 50 for the account management people we put out in the CoStar side. And so we have the ability to reduce where we have redundancy or technology has eliminated function or we’re not doing print anymore. For them, we want to deploy it into client sales-oriented type stuff. Also, Scott mentioned that the – Scott, and I noticed that, Scott, we had a slightly different organic growth rate for Apartments.com, and I’m definitely going with yours. And the – but the – he mentioned that the headcount in sales is down slightly year-over-year. That is – that’s only if you exclude those customer relationship management people we pushed out. So with those people, we’re up 25 net-net. And you might see a little more of that kind of reallocating as we pull all of these things together to get the best mix. Is that more than you were looking for?
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move on to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens.
Andrew Florance: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Huff: Good morning, Andy, Scott and Rich.
Andrew Florance: Good morning.
Scott Wheeler: Hello.
Brett Huff: Thanks for the new segment detail, very helpful. So first want to say that.
Andrew Florance: You’re welcome.
Brett Huff: One detailed question, one big-picture question. The detail question is, you mentioned that you are having more people out doing training, I think is what you called them to kind of training folks, as you think about merging the Loop and CoStar databases. Can you just tell us again, is the worry that, is the user interface going to change, and you want to make sure that goes smoothly, or is it more a function of, hey, we want to show people what they could get and help them up – and help the up-sell process? I’m just confused about what that comment was directed at.
Andrew Florance: Sure. What? Me, worry? The – that’s not what we worry about. So what it really is, it’s just sort of, again, I just think that in these high subscription base businesses, it’s important that you maintain close client contact across – as you approach $1 billion in revenue, you just want to make sure that you have good, solid relationships. And it’s not a reaction to any one particular thing, it’s just good business. And partially, as your sales increase, as you keep adding more customers faster and your salespeople can achieve really good production numbers on new sales, you’ve just got to make sure that you’re continuing to have a relationship with that bulk of hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue that have been in place for quite sometime. So that’s a big part of it. The other thing is, there are a number of really good clients who are using the LoopNet platform, either for information or information marketing, who are not using the CoStar property platform. There are tens of thousands of them. And these are good firms, and these are firms that we want to develop our relationship with them. When we acquired LoopNet, they had a mission statement which said: we never talk to customers after we sell them. And I mean literally, that was the mission statement. And that doesn’t really resonate with us. You should communicate with your customers. You should have a priority on customer service and relationship. So one of the things we’re trying to do is make sure that we are out there, and that we are supporting the LoopNet customers just in whatever they’re buying from us today. So that as we transition to much greater buying opportunities with our company, they will have good feelings with us, and that it will be easier to move through that process. So it’s a – some of these folks that this customer relationship management team are spending time on might be spending a couple of thousand bucks with us right now to get apartments CRM. But some might be spending a couple hundred dollars with us across a hundred brokers to use LoopNet Premium Searcher. Well, they are a client one way or another and that small client with a lot of potential might be spending $5,000, $10,000 a month more with us next year and we want to begin that process now, not at the time that we have a financial transaction in front of them. But again, it’s not a worry or weakness thing. It’s actually a strength thing. Like if you feel you’re in a great position, you want to bring your customers along and deliver all the value. And we’ve got that ability to do that, and that’s what we’re focused on. And I would say that the number of meetings we are having with customers right now on a daily or weekly basis is probably four times the number of meetings we were having the same time a quarter ago. So – and for any business, a lot of customer contact is a good thing.
Brett Huff: Okay, thank you. And my follow-up was the big-picture one. You articulated kind of the addressable market that you see over the next, whatever three to five years for the ILS business, the apartments business. Can you – any update to that? Can you remind us of how you see that, maybe how you see your share in that, and kind of the long-term margin profile of that part of your business?
Andrew Florance: Sure. And the very – so first of all, on the margin basis, remember that, we expect to be profitable in this space in the fourth quarter this year. And you can see that margin expansion. You can see that we’re able to show that margin expansion even with the Super Bowl ads and other ads running during the quarter. So we do believe that the margins are – the potential is excellent over the next three to five years, and that they are in line with the 40% ranges. We’ve talked a number of times about different size of markets in the $2 billion range. You have direct competitors, or fairly direct competitors in the billion-plus range right now. We believe that we can – we believe we are just about to cross one of our direct competitors and go from the second most revenue in the space to the most revenue in this space. And we think we can hold a significant share advantage in the multifamily space similar to the share advantage we hold in the ops industrial retail space. So and then, there is – so there is the very straightforward business we are talking about, which is the billions, $2 billion-plus business of driving renters into the leasing offices of these buildings. And that, we understand well, and we are making good progress on it. There’s a whole series of other ancillary businesses that we think are pretty exciting that are growth areas down the road. But the core is clear, addressable, and that’s what we’re really focused on, is harvesting that opportunity.
Brett Huff: Great. Thanks for the detail.
Andrew Florance: Yep.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go to the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin: Thank. Good morning.
Andrew Florance: Good morning, Andre. How are you doing?
Scott Wheeler: Hello?
Andre Benjamin: I’m good, thanks. So I want to dig a little bit more into the cost performance, given you beat revenue guidance at the midpoint by about $3 million, but EBITDA by $15 million. I guess, how did you end up being that far ahead of your cost expectations, given the guidance was given pretty late into February, and how much of that was in Apartments versus the core Suite and other parts of the business? And then last piece is just, given that how do we think about upside versus downside risk to the implied cost guidance for the rest of the year?
Scott Wheeler: So let me just make a few comments to that, Andre. The components of the better cost performance were really two broad areas. Obviously, we are all about marketing spend as a big category, and then all of the personnel-related costs. And there’s a number of other costs in the business, but they are not as big as those ones. When you first – I mentioned the marketing spend, we had about $3 million or so that didn’t get spent in the quarter and they’ll move off into later in the year. And those just were better performance in some of the things we did, and some things that will be timed better later on. We also had some really good cost performance late in the quarter that we don’t see recurring again. I mentioned those combined were about $6 million, that will shift out and not help us later. But then when you saw the ability to manage the headcount effectively and find more synergies in the business and the hiring plans that we had didn’t need to be as aggressive as we thought they would be when we went into the quarter. So those things helped us both lift the gross margin side of things and keep the personnel costs well down. And those really are the major components that gave us that. When you look going forward, we’ve obviously improved the cost picture that we expect in Q2 and the guidance that we gave. And then we left the second-half with some investments that we need to continue to make. As Andy mentioned, as we find productivity, we need to put some of that money back in over the second-half of the year, which we’ve provided for now. So we continue to find more opportunities. We continue to integrate. We’ll continue to use those and shift them around. So we feel good about the balance of where we are with the costs and we’ll always shoot to outperform those as we go forward.
Andrew Florance: Yes, the big picture, it’s also just – it’s the season of cost control. So, we came through a – two major acquisitions, major conversions of products, pulling together of hundreds and hundreds of people from new companies into one combined team. We went through a major reorganization of our management structures and the way our departments are organized in the end of the fourth quarter. Our departments that have hundreds and hundreds of people, all have new leaders right now. And those leaders were given a mandate to understand why they had staffing that they had in different areas, and was it really necessary, or was it just an artifact and momentum of an old business model that no longer applied to the reality of the combined companies. And so, there was – it’s never pleasant, but there was a lot of focus on just rationalizing why do we have what we have here? And there were areas that – as the dust settled with all of these integrations and new product launches and efforts to move from number five to number one in the major new space, you would find something where you had a 4:1 manager-to-staff ratio, and you don’t need that. You can easily operate in 1:8. So just a lot of focus on that kind of stuff. And we don’t like to – the divisions, the segment presidents, or the product area presidents, we delegate and push responsibility to them to find these cost savings that didn’t hurt the business. And we have to see them produce them in yield though, before we really talk to shareholders about them. So it’s just been the management team with a little bit of shift in their bonus structure more towards EBITDA have delivered on more cost savings than we thought we could deliver on.
Andre Benjamin: Thank you.
Andrew Florance: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone.
Andrew Florance: Good morning, Bill.
Scott Wheeler: Hi, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So congratulations on an – on the impressive profitability this quarter.
Andrew Florance: Thank you very much.
Bill Warmington: So for my first question, I was going to ask about the difference between the net sales – net new sales and annual subscriptions at $25 million, and the net bookings of $30 million? It would be helpful, I think, if you could talk a little bit about the dynamic between those two, and how we should think about those two metrics going forward.
Andrew Florance: Yes, a lot of that is and I’ll answer and then I’ll let our CFO, Scott Wheeler, answer as well. So a lot of that is just – we’re very focused right now. We have a better value proposition for people trying to market their apartments on the Internet we – than our competitors do. And so we are trying to move a lot of long-established relationships into our apartment network. And as you do that, you go meet with these folks. They have never seen a one-year contract for apartment advertising. And I do think that once they are into a relationship with you, you can get the one-year contracts. But I do not want to give up share-shift opportunity for the optics of an earnings call of saying that the difference between our bookings and our subscription growth are close. I would rather have the revenue and the business and worry about the optics in an earnings call later. So it’s just a policy shift of saying, bring these folks on into a business relationship on whatever contract term. If we deliver for them, which I believe, we are doing for the overwhelming majority of the people we’re bringing onboard, then you can give them annual contracts on renewal that give them better pricing. So it’s more of a short-term tactic thing.
Bill Warmington: So the subscription version of that would be captured in the annual subscription piece, the $25 million, and the non-subscription contracts on the apartment side are going to be captured under the net bookings?
Andrew Florance: Correct.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, that’s correct. Scott can give you the correct answer.
Bill Warmington: Anything there going on with cancellations on the Loop side, or anything there?
Andrew Florance: No.
Scott Wheeler: No, nothing really significantly moving around on the Loop side.
Bill Warmington: Okay.
Scott Wheeler: The changes from quarter to quarter on our annualized net sales versus our total net bookings numbers, they’ve both been in the sort of 25 to 30ish range over the last four quarters for each. And the noises in the apartments things that Andy mentioned, the CoStar Suite pieces continue to be strong and advance, as they have for many years. So I think once we get – once we start getting past the annualization of the apartments businesses being combined, the sales forces having their focus on customer retention, as well as growth, and you start to see these stabilize more, you’ll see less of these sort of $4 million to $5 million up and down swings sequential quarters. And you’ll see them start to stabilize more. But that $30 million overall net new number is a great number. We expect to continue to see that going ahead.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And as a follow-up, Andy, in your comments you mentioned the Apartments.com offering being a better value. And so my question is, have you been able to quantify for advertisers that your leads are higher-quality or better value than the competition?
Andrew Florance: Well, the advertisers and our clients have to do that for us, because they are the ones ultimately capturing and managing those leads. And so we see that in our conversations with them, and in these focus groups and through our share gains. So I’m getting a clear message from them that it’s a dramatic difference. And I mentioned that in a conversation not too long ago with a senior executive of the biggest apartment operator in the world. They said that they have been tracking it, and that the lead flow and closed rates of our leads continued to widen dramatically over any other source. And I forgot what the number was. We were calling 62% of all Internet traffic on the search results, on the apartment listing site. So we are just getting a really good share. And then, again, we’re not playing the games that a lot of folks have fallen into on lead-gen, where they were shotgunning leads or serving up apartments that didn’t meet the customer’s requirement. Hoping the customer wouldn’t – the renter wouldn’t notice before they communicate with the leasing office, sort of a lead-at-all-costs mentality. I think that our strategy of just giving them really straight-forward connections, it’s what the renter is looking for, your apartment works for it, and then making sure we have the most traffic by far. We are getting a much higher time on-site, which to me indicates that they are actually working to find their apartment on our site. And then I think probably the most important metric for me, which you can’t quantify, I don’t have a comp score number for, I don’t have a Google analytics for is, two years ago when we acquired the Apartments.com website, one of our young staffers, maybe 24 years old came up to me after a presentation I had given to the – all the employees. And he said, honestly he said, quite honestly, Apartments.com sucks, I would never use it to find an apartment. And I said, okay, I appreciate that position, but we’re going to work on it and see how we do. And now early in the first quarter 2016, I’m running into all sorts of very young Millennials who are telling me they found their apartment on Apartments.com, as I do it. And that’s probably the best indicator of lead flow to our clients, and effectively working. So that’s not really a comp score number. Does that answer your question, Bill? Are you now gone?
Operator: He has gone. We’ll move on to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Scott Wheeler: He left.
Andrew Florance: Poor Bill.
Sterling Auty: Hey, thanks. Hi, guys.
Andrew Florance: Hi, Sterling.
Sterling Auty: I was wondering, when you look at the net bookings number, first of all, can you give us the number for the fourth quarter? I don’t know if it was actually given in the call. And then when you look across the customers, can you give us a little bit of qualitative color around what’s driving that number? In other words, what’s the type of customer within like the core CoStar Suite that’s buying? Is it investors, who might it be? That would be helpful. Thanks.
Scott Wheeler: Yes, let me cover the numbers real quick just to reiterate the net new bookings was $30 million in the quarter. And the net new on annual subscriptions was $25 million.
Sterling Auty: And the prior quarter, what was it?
Scott Wheeler: The prior quarter was $29 million on the net new annual subscriptions.
Andrew Florance: Yes. Okay. So the prior quarter…
Sterling Auty: What was it – hold on. But what was it prior quarter net booking? So the equivalent of $30 million, that’s what was the [Multiple Speakers]
Scott Wheeler: Yes, that was $25 million.
Sterling Auty: Okay.
Andrew Florance: So the bookings went up.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. The bookings went up sequential quarter, and the annual bookings went down.
Andrew Florance: Down, right. And that’s going to be…
Scott Wheeler: By about the same amount.
Andrew Florance: Right. By about the same amount.
Scott Wheeler: Yes. And we looked at quarters before, the net bookings were back up to the $30 million. So, again, you get this shifting noises between, as the apartments pieces settle out, and that’s what’s causing some of that volatility.
Sterling Auty: And maybe just – can you guys just take a quick second just walk through the net bookings? I think the net new subscription services on annual contracts-only is pretty self-explanatory. But can you remind us, because I believe the net bookings is inclusive of churn. But can you just walk us through how you are calculating that, and how we should interpret that metric?
Scott Wheeler: Yes. So the net new bookings has all of the new contracts obviously that we bring in during any given period, and then it takes the churn of clients that we lose or things that go away out of it. So you get this net number that we first look at on a quarterly basis, and then we do the annualization to get to those numbers in total. And then we look at it obviously by the different business sectors we have and watch how those numbers progress through the quarters. And those also advise our decisions on what’s happening in the market, where we deploy our sales forces and our different resources to go after the – both the opportunities and the impacts they’re having. Keep in mind that we – as we started to move things when you get back to the annual contract ones, you start to move things to annual contracts. We’ll start to lap the full year when we started doing that for the apartments. So you’ll start to see clients, for the first time, renewing annual contracts coming up here in the next quarter or so. So there’s still going to be noise in these as we go for a couple quarters on this.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move on to the line of Brandon Dobell with William Blair.
Brandon Dobell: Thanks. Guys, given the discussions around the net new numbers and the sales force changes, how should we think about expectations exiting this year for organic growth in the old core business, as well as apartments? It seems like there is more opportunity for accelerating that growth rate than not, given how the changes are going to work through the system. But I want to understand how you guys are setting expectations, both internally and with the street?
Andrew Florance: Yes. So internally, the way we look at it is, I’m very optimistic as to where we are right now across all three major segments that we look at. So on the CoStar side, we are moving a lot of resources that had been diverted into apartments sales back into the core CoStar business. The core CoStar business is doing really well, real strong performance there. And that is before we do two of the most important things we could possibly do to capture a lot of revenue, which is integrate LoopNet and CoStar, and expand the successful CMA product that came on the apartment side into all the market segments. So I see a lot of upside over the next two years on the core CoStar Suite. I feel really good about that. I see where that is, and I feel good about that. On the apartment side, we’ve gone through that challenging period where half your sales force was just trying to move people from print to electronic with no revenue gain. We have done the – made the hard decisions to shift the way territories are aligned, so that people are much more efficient in their day. And separated out the sales structure, so that you have a cleaner focus on apartments, and a little bit of growth in that apartments group. So I would expect acceleration in their sales over the next two years at a consistent and incremental basis with a little bit of investment occurring on customer relationship in the early part of the year, and then just getting to meet everybody. There’s thousands of – about tens of thousands of customers they have to meet. And then huge opportunity on the LoopNet side, just because that one frankly got short-shift in all the excitement of the last year, so in apartments and in CoStar core. And so that sales force has drifted down to a number that we’re not crazy about, mainly because the CoStar salespeople just were focusing on apartments, not LoopNet. So we are bringing more of a stronger, independent LoopNet sales force up to speed and with a very good return on investment, because it’s the old subscription model of – you take – you are going to have, no matter, if you take three steps forward, or 10 steps forward, you have two steps back, we’re sort of in the three steps forward, two steps backward on churn with LoopNet, adding one more salesperson, adding 25% increase in salespeople can, in theory, increase revenue growth by 50%. So lot of things going on here that we’re really investing on Q4, Q3, Q1 of next year. We’re doing a lot of things just to ensure consistent strong growth over the next three to four years.
Operator: Thank you.
Scott Wheeler: To cover the – sorry, to cover the guidance part of that question in the CoStar Suite sector a 11% to 13% is the growth rate we expect going forward. In the first quarter, we were at 12.5%, as we mentioned, so pressing the upper end of that. We expect that to continue to press the upper end, as Andy mentioned, going forward for the rest of the year. On the Apartment side, we said 20% to 25% pro forma growth. For the outlook for the year, we get 24% in the first quarter. We expect to say solidly within that middle part of that range for the rest of the quarters of this year. So that’s really where the guidance is, and it’s all very strong and positive.
Brandon Dobell: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll move to the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and all the color. And I just – I’m trying to understand a little bit mechanically, and I know a lot of questions have sort of gone in this direction. But when I look at the growth in net new on annual subscriptions, which has accelerated, it did accelerate in the fourth quarter on a trailing four quarter basis. And then I consider the total percent – the percent of your total revenue that’s on annual contracts, why wouldn’t there be an acceleration in reported revenue, as we go through the year, even if we saw a decel in net new on annual in the second quarter? Why shouldn’t the business just sort of mechanically accelerate as 2016 progresses in more of a pronounced fashion than what your guidance implies?
Scott Wheeler: Well, I think, we’re – well, I think as we continue to watch the net news come in and we watch the annual subscriptions each quarter, they are strong, they continue to grow. We want to see them accelerate for the rest of the year. We’re going to watch that progress. We think there’s a good chance that we continue to progress and move forward. But at this stage in the year, we want to just keep our forecast in a modest, but optimistic range, and move forward and see how they go.
Andrew Florance: Keep our powder dry.
Scott Wheeler: That’s a good way to say.
Andrew Florance: On this rainy day in Washington.
Scott Wheeler: Keep our powder dry.
Andrew Florance: Did you have a follow-up to that question?
Operator: One moment, please.
Andrew Florance: Okay.
Operator: Okay, Mr. Jeffrey, your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay, thanks. If there is a follow-up, it would be around the sort of explicit sales of data into the apartment communities. Can you talk a little bit about the ramp in data sales, and whether or not sort of qualitatively data are pulling along share gains? And just sort of how to think about that dynamic?
Andrew Florance: Yes, specifically, you are talking about the information products around Multifamily and how they are doing, and how we’re getting share gains?
Andrew Jeffrey: Exactly, right.
Andrew Florance: Yes, well, we’ve gotten terrific share gains in that space without a doubt. And I don’t have – I do not have actual competitor numbers, but I have an idea. And my belief is, is that, we have sold maybe twice some of the traditional competitors’ entire revenues this year in the space. So I would call that a really good share gain, if you can sell their whole revenues once or twice in the year, and it’s really just the beginning. So the product is real. It works. We have – we’ll continue to evolve it, refine it. It’s on version 1.1, or 1.12 maybe. We’ll continue to push it. We’re doing – I was very happy with where it’s going overall. And our sales force is very excited about it. Our sales force is finding good traction with it. So we’re really in the very early stages on that. And I think we just have a big fundamental advantage in the fact that we are – the most heavily traffic website for people shopping for apartments. So that collects a lot of information in search behavior, that’s very valuable to our customers. For example, some cool stuff we’re doing with the product right now, that no one else can do is, people traditionally try to understand who their apartment building competes with by looking at similar-rated buildings within two miles of their apartment building. And that would be a very simplistic way to look at it. We have nearly -- we have a billion searches – a billion property views on our system in 2015. We know exactly who your competitor is, like no one else knows. So when someone looks at a one bedroom in your community, we know exactly what other one bedrooms they tend to look at when they consider your community. And it’s not similarly rated communities within one mile, it’s actually it could be someone eight miles down the highway that you’re competing against, and you don’t know it. And only we can really tell you that in CoStar Market Analytics. So we have a very unique product, and we’ll continue to surface these kinds of advantages in the product. And I think we will do incredibly well. So, we have to keep evolving it, because you’re – it’s a complicated business. And we’re getting more nuanced and we’re tweaking it. But all good. And what part of the question? I forget, because I was having fun there.
Andrew Jeffrey: I think you’ve hit all the high points. Thanks, Andy.
Andrew Florance: Okay. And we just published a paper in American Real Estate Society about our correlated filter peering of competitors. And I hope we do – we win an award for it. We’ll see.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll go back to the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin: Thanks. Just one follow-up here. Given the amount of attention that we hear on the core suite and concerns about the growth there, with the backtrack in the CRE market, could you talk a little bit about how much of the sales growth came from brokers versus some of the other initiatives, like pushing to institutional lenders, apartment managers, et cetera? And have you seen any slowdown in the growth rate of selling to brokers in this quarter versus the last few?
Andrew Florance: I wouldn’t address this – I would not say there is a concern with growth rate. We’re at the upper end of the range on big numbers. So we’re – there’s LoopNet like, it’s actually really strong with upside potential – significant upside potential, as we just showed in the UK, as we integrate the LoopNet and CoStar families together. I think I’m very optimistic about what that means. So we are hitting it on all cylinders, and the brokerage business is strong, as well as the owner and the institutional component. Our sales force always likes to go to the institutional and owner, because they are typically bigger-dollar contracts up front. If I were to look at a crystal ball over the next 18 to 24 months, I think just because of the conversion with LoopNet, I think there will be a surge of brokerage sales over the next 18 to 24 months, which is why I invested in putting the 50 more customer relationship people to prepare the field for that surge. And we’ll probably grow that group maybe to 80 people over the course of the year. So it’s good. It’s good, it’s good, and it’s good, and it’s all good, and it’s all good. So, there’s nothing I’m aware of that is bad. It’s good. So, okay, but I think with that, I think we’re all set here. We’ll wrap up, and we’ll get the call done before we get to 12:15. Thank you all very much for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Bye-bye.

Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Rich. Good morning, and thank everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end financial results call. 2015 was an excellent year for CoStar Group. We generated excellent top line growth of 24% year-over-year closing 2015 with $712 million in revenue, up from $576 million in 2014. We had $100 million of net new subscription sales on annual subscriptions during 2015. For the fourth quarter of 2015, net new sales on annual subscriptions were $29 million, an increase of 69% year-over-year. We achieved our highest quarter ever for net new sales on our core CoStar information services. LoopNet did well in the quarter as net new sales and annual subscriptions accelerate 80% sequentially from the third quarter of 2015 and 52% over the fourth quarter of 2014. Our primary focus for 2015 was investing aggressively to integrate CoStar, Apartments.com and Apartment Finder in order to drive efficiencies and achieve sustainable long-term cost savings. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we increased net income year-over-year by 65%. Margin improvement was most dramatic in the fourth quarter of 2015 as we realized cost savings from our Apartments business integration efforts and increased EBITDA by 150% over the third quarter of 2015. Our EBITDA margin climbed 29% in the fourth quarter. We believe these results show that we are clearly on our way to achieving our stated goal of $1 billion revenue and 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018. Before I update you on our progress on Apartments.com, I want to give you a clear picture of revenue growth in our core CoStar suite service and our other major products. Core CoStar Suite in North America grew 12.4% during the full-year 2015 over full-year 2014. And that is at the top end of our consistent 11% to 13% growth guidance. That is up in absolute dollars compared to the growth from full-year 2013 to full-year 2014 but down just 33 basis points from the 2014, 2013 growth rate of 12.7%, so they're roughly similar growth rates up and down a couple of basis points. Core CoStar revenue accelerated back up to 12.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 over the fourth quarter of 2014. Core CoStar in the UK grew at a higher base of 13.8% year-over-year in local Great British pounds, but with the negative exchange rate effect, it grew at only 5.5% in U.S. currency basis. Despite the diversion of resources to the Apartment marketplace services, LoopNet Premium Listers still grew at 12% during the full year of 2015 compared to the full-year 2014. As we've mentioned before, we are de-emphasizing LoopNet information services and as a result, LoopNet Premium Searcher grew at 9% during the full year of 2015 versus 2014. For the full year 2015 over 2014, CoStar Real Estate Manager grew at 20%, our Businesses for Sale Marketplace grew at 16%, our Land for Sale services grew at 17%, and CoStar Portfolio of Strategies grew at 7%. We have eight other smaller services with a wide range of growth rates. We are no longer selling two of our smallest-producing services, so we expect their growth to be negative. The Core CoStar Services are consistently strong and growing. We believe that with the Apartment Services doing so well, we can balance our focus between our Core Information Services and the Apartment Rental Marketplace Services. As a result, we expect even more growth in the CoStar Core Services, going forward. In 2015, we focused on building the premier marketplace for renting an apartment in the United States. According to comScore, Apartments.com enjoyed more visitor traffic in 2015 than any other apartment rental website. During the fourth quarter, we achieved the number one position among major competing apartment Web sites in: unique visitors, total visits, total page views, total time on site, average time on site, lowest bounce rate, consumer engagement, unaided awareness, search engine optimization, search engine marketing, and the number of apartment buildings offered and the handsomest. Apartments.com – that last part was a joke – comScore does not report on that. Apartments.com finished the year with 60% more page views than our number one competitor, and 350% more page views than our number two competitor. Our most recent focus groups tells us that our website provides the best renter experience among our competitors. Revenue from Apartments.com was up approximately 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Total Apartment related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $53.4 million, up 108% over $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. We achieved outstanding growth in the fourth quarter of 660% year-over-year in net new sales on Apartment's annual subscriptions. We believe that the sales success stands in stark contrast to our significant competitors in the space, who we believe have shown little revenue growth over the past year. According to Moody's, RentPath revenue is essentially flat since May 2012. In October 2015, Moody's reported a downgrade report that RentPath generated approximately $250 million of revenue for the 12 months ended June 30, 2015. Back in May 2012, Moody's reported that RentPath generated approximately $246 million of revenue in 2012, including approximately seven months of revenues from Rent.com following the acquisition close. 2015 was a particularly difficult year for RentPath's CEOs, as three different individuals have held the position since our relaunch at the NAA industry conference in June. We further believe that we are offering marketing opportunities to apartment communities with up to 10 times the exposure of major competitors at a price point 20% below theirs. That is driving significant share shift to us. In November of 2015, we announced our exclusive agreement with Move, Inc. to power 50-unit plus apartment community listings on Move's network of websites which includes Realtor.com, Move.com and Doorsteps.com. We now promote our advertisers' communities across six major apartment websites with a single point of contact at prices we believe are below the largest providers in the market apartment listings space. So far, the results have been very good with over 0.25 million leads generated for our apartments' customers since their listings went live on Realtor.com's site in December. We expect that in February, the Move partnership will be responsible for 10% of leads to our advertisers. In March 2015, we embarked on an unprecedented marketing campaign complete with national advertising to promote Apartments.com. There are 110 million renters in the U.S. spending just under $0.5 trillion a year on rent. That compares to automobiles at roughly the same level. And that is approximately five times what people spend on beer each year. The market for apartment renters is growing rapidly and spending on rentals increased by $100 billion since 2010. This is one of the largest consumer segments in the U.S. Since the beginning of the campaign in March last year through the end of December, we generated over 7.9 billion impressions for our ads. Most of you have seen the television campaign featuring Jeff Goldblum; it was responsible for 2 billion impressions. We also generated over 3.4 billion impressions digitally, over 2.2 billion impressions for out-of-home and radio, while social media added another 190 million impressions. As we've previously stated, we expect to lower our 2016 marketing spend by approximately $20 million below our 2015 budget levels. With that budget, we were still able to begin 2016 with a bang as we initiated a comprehensive marketing campaign using Super Bowl 50 as the vehicle. In addition to continuing to build the Apartments.com brand, we demonstrated to property managers and owners that we're committed to the apartment space as we move into 2016. The earned media opportunity around our Super Bowl ad was very successful, achieving a publicity value of more than $14 million. On Tuesday before the Super Bowl, CBS showcased Apartments.com in a special primetime sneak preview feature alongside other top brands including Audi, Coca-Cola, Buick and Budweiser. Also leading up to the game, The Wall Street Journal announced that Apartments.com would be advertising the Super Bowl, reaching our key client constituency of owners and property managers. The Moving On Up campaign featured Jeff Goldblum, Lil Wayne and saturated Super Bowl headlines with the inclusion of our Moving Day ad in 15 top commercial rankings in national news and entertainment publications, beating out well-known players like Mountain Dew, Honda and my favorite, Skittles. Our Moving Day commercial broke into leading Super Bowl polls, ranked number one in The Wall Street Journal poll for best Super Bowl commercial and top star power. I do have to say I voted twice in the Wall Street Journal poll. USA TODAY Ad Meter included the spot as one of the six finest Super Bowl commercials and we were the only tech company to take TiVo's top 10 list, coming in at number seven for most consumer engagement. Apartments.com was also widely recognized in the entertainment sector, earning inclusion as one of the best commercials in Super Bowl 50 in Rolling Stone, US Weekly, Entertainment Tonight and more. We appeared in seven national broadcast features including CBS Super Bowl's greatest commercials, the Today show, Mornings with Maria Bartiromo and Squawk Box. We secured coverage in 50 print publications including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY newspapers, and we're covered in over digital features including The Wall Street Journal, Advertising Age, The Washington Post and Sports Illustrated. Additionally, we appeared in over 700 digital roundups including the Business Insider, San Francisco Chronicle, Boston Herald, The Chicago Tribune and Yahoo! Finance. We garnered over 143 broadcast mentions including Good Day DC, EyeOpener Dallas, Extra, Good Day New York and ABC World News Now. And Al Roker selected us as his favorite ad. So Super Bowl is a highly visible venue and important branding opportunity. But our Super Bowl ad represents a small component of our 2016 advertising budget. The major component for 2016 is the half a dozen new spots we've just completed filming with Jeff Goldblum this week. And we think these spots will evolve and extend the brand when combined with our digital initiatives. I feel that we have an open field ahead of us right now, and I'm very excited about the opportunity we have this year to further distance the Apartments.com brand from our competitors. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the rebuild and launched the completely new ApartmentFinder.com site filled with rich CoStar information and current availabilities. We have integrated the back ends of Apartments.com, CoStar and Apartment Finder, thereby leveraging the same system, support, research content, sales platform to power our entire apartments network consisting of Apartments.com, Apartment Home Living, Apartment Finder, the three websites owned by Move, as well as CoStar Market Analytics. We have positioned Apartment Finder as a place for great deals and great apartments. We believe we have dramatically improved the site experience and I encourage you all to go visit Apartment Finder and see for yourself. It's a really great Web site and consumers are getting good deals as we highlight apartments that have recently lowered their price or who are offering deals like free rent for a month. The Apartment Finder print services are now gone and all of our contracts have been converted to digital advertising. Our Apartment Finder sales team is now free to go out and sell rather than convert, which I believe will increase our overall sales of apartment rental marketing services in 2016. We have now achieved Apartment Finder cost synergies of approximately $20 million within seven months after close of the acquisition. The Apartment Finder acquisition has been a great success to-date and brings a great new team to CoStar Group. And I believe it will continue to help us transform our apartment listing services. CoStar Market Analytics service is very closely related to Apartments.com in that each product is a key piece to the rent maximization puzzle. We often cross-sell the two services together. We believe we are the only company providing a comprehensive bundle of services that addresses the need for lead generation services, as well as information services. The information component of our apartment sector products, CoStar Market Analytics, generated very strong sales growth in 2015. This new service added nearly $22 million of net new subscription sales to the core CoStar offering in the 11 months from March 2015 launch through January of 2016. We believe that at $22 million in revenue, we have penetrated less than 10% of the market opportunity, and we have the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars of information and analytics sales in the multifamily vertical. We believe CoStar Market Analytics has even greater potential financial benefit to CoStar because it can help us extend penetration beyond apartment clients only into valuable customer verticals such as banks, institutional owners and owners who demand comprehensive commercial real estate information coverage for all the major sectors they invest in, and they want to find it in one place. These clients typically have more risk exposure, greater potential upside, and larger budgets from which to draw for our services than do our traditional brokerage clients. Our annual subscription services continue to enjoy high thrilling 12-month renewal rates of 90%. Our core U.S. CoStar information renewal rates remain very steady at an extraordinary 94%. The LoopNet and Apartments marketplace services historically have lower renewal rates, and the blend with CoStar information services brings the overall rate down to 90%. But at the same time, we've been working hard to move both Apartments and LoopNet to generally annual contracts with a goal to significantly increase their ultimate renewal rates. So good news in the renewal rate area. I want to take a few minutes to discuss what we're seeing in commercial real estate market economics. Fundamentals are very healthy. Annual rent growth increased for each of the four main property types to an average 3.3% in 2015, and vacancy rates declined slightly by 30 basis points, while net absorption and construction levels rose. Geographically, the vast majority of U.S. metros reported improving fundamentals. For example, within the office market, 64% of submarkets record a quarter-over-quarter improvement in occupancy, which is a market cycle high. 56% of the 54 major metros now have occupancy rates above the 2006-2007 peak. In the last commercial real estate downturn, that indicator fell dramatically 18 months before the downturn occurred. So, I look at it as one of the best leading indicators for a commercial real estate downturns, and right now, it's solidly in positive territory. While conditions are strong, there's a great deal of room to run. Office, retail and industrial construction is on the rise, but in all of these property types, construction is still well, well below 2000 levels and long-term averages. As is often typical, some markets aren't following this exceptionally positive national trend and not surprisingly, metro Houston is the best example due to energy prices. But even there where real estate demand has slowed, net absorption has remained positive for every quarter and every property type with the exception of apartments in the fourth quarter. The demand for real estate investment has been broadly based with double-digit sales gains last year for every major property type. In 2015, we saw a record-breaking $637 billion in commercial real estate sales, up 20% from one year ago and 15% over the prior 2007 peak. The fourth quarter of 2015 achieved a record $180 billion. And though property sales pricing is rising, it remains rational. Cap rates across property types are maintaining a 70 to 140 basis points spread over risk-free rates such as the 10-year treasury. This is unlike the period of 1999 and 2007 when cap rates irrationally pushed well below the 10-year rate. We see a broad base of strength in the major property sectors. For office, all fundamental metrics hit market-cycle highs in 2015 with net absorption up 8%, completions up 40%, occupancy up 50 basis points and rent growth up 60 basis points to a 4.4% annual rate. The strongest office markets continue to be technology-dominated metros with double-digit rent gains still coming out of the San Francisco Bay area. We're also find that the flight-to-quality space is very strong with four-star and five-star office properties, achieving net absorption rates twice as high as their fair market share. The apartment sector performed solidly and rents grew 6% year-over-year. Apartment net absorption matched 2014's market-cycle high of 209,000 units which is 40% over the 2010-2013 average. Net completions of 214,000 units in 2015 exceeded net absorption slightly for the first time in this cycle and were up 7% from 2014. With this robust construction activity, vacancy rates moved up 35 basis points in the later part of the year from record lows and rents began to fall from record highs. Still, the vacancy rates were extraordinarily low, so as they come up a bit, they're still extraordinarily low. And the rents have moved to extraordinarily high as they come down a little bit, they're still extraordinarily high. So, but we believe an uptick in vacancy rate would have a very positive impact on our business. We are focused on winning advertising business with approximately 53,050-unit-plus market rate properties in the U.S. that do not currently advertise on Apartments.com. 23,000 of these 50-unit-plus properties are essentially fully leased with occupancy rates at or above 98%. Fully leased properties obviously are more difficult to sell advertising to. If vacancy rates move up a few basis points or a few points, it's likely that a significant share of these 23,000 full-leased properties would move more into a more active marketing phase, thereby dramatically increasing our size of opportunity. So, a little bit of increase in vacancy rates is a good thing for Apartments.com. We had another excellent year in fourth quarter in the United Kingdom. Revenue, EBITDA and net profit targets for the UK were all exceeded. Revenue increased by approximately 14% and EBITDA growth was well into double-digits in local currency. We had several major CoStar Suite migration wins at the end of the year including JLO and Cushman & Wakefield, as we welcome back the former DTZ users to CoStar.We also secured the commitment of the Scottish government to use CoStar Suite. CoStar UK is expected to complete the migration from legacy focused platform at the end of March. These conversions were made in average price increase of 34%. We have migrated all the large brokerages in the United Kingdom, except one whose contract in England expires at the end of March. Every single major firm in Scotland has migrated. Our new acquisition in Spain is progressing in line with expectations and we expect to have more to talk about this as the year progresses. All these numbers are a testament to our strong leadership in the UK and the potential global appeal of the CoStar service offering. The LoopNet Marketplace remains vibrant as we have over 10 million registered LoopNet members. As I mentioned earlier, LoopNet net new sales on annual subscriptions in the fourth quarter accelerated significantly with an 80% increase sequentially from the third quarter of 2015 and 52% growth over the fourth quarter 2014. With our larger combined Apartments.com and Apartment Finder sales force up to speed, our CoStar sales team can begin to return focus back on LoopNet and CoStar sales. As you know, we're in the midst of making substantial upgrades to LoopNet. A few weeks ago, we launched a new Web site with a cleaner user interface. We have also begun a tiered advertising structure on the LoopNet website offering diamond and platinum packages that give brokers and owners the ability to pay more, to sort higher, enjoy a larger ad and most importantly cross market across the CoStar platform and audience. Our single-highest priority in 2016 is to complete the integration of the back ends of CoStar and LoopNet. We expect this will have a significant positive effect on our revenues, reduce our costs and increase our EBITDA. Tens of thousands of brokers and owners consistently enter and maintain good quality information on hundreds of thousands of properties in LoopNet. In fact, we often see higher quality information in LoopNet from some brokers and even many brokers, then we see through the CoStar research process. Currently, the LoopNet information does not flow automatically in to CoStar, so we collect it through our research process at material and significant expense. With two separate databases, our clients also incur the unnecessary expense of maintaining information in both systems. The LoopNet and CoStar databases are typically significantly different. So, in theory, each is less than perfect. We believe that when we create one common back end and the structure forces continuous reconciliation, we'll have a dramatically higher quality database. We believe we can identify those that digitally submit reliable content to us and begin to flow their additions and changes into our systems automatically. This is expected to reduce our required research head count while giving us more timely and complete information. In addition to merging the building listing and comps databases, we also plan to merge the contact or people databases of the two companies. We expect that this will again reduce our cost of maintaining information and improve our marketing and sales intelligence. Once we have merged the databases, we'll be able to consistently differentiate the amount of information that the lower-paying LoopNet information subscribers benefit from versus the amount of information advantage higher paying customers benefit from. Most importantly, we'll be able to automate a clear, continuous comparison of the datasets to our users to better facilitate up sells to our more robust information products. While we complete this integration, we expect to launch the second phase of CoStar and LoopNet cross-selling. In the first phase, we generated more than $80 million of additional CoStar subscription revenue while reducing our cost more than $20 million. I believe that this next phase has greater potential. I expect the second phase will be approximately a two-year up sell process after integration is complete. Currently, there are 130,000 active LoopNet members that log into LoopNet in the last 12 months and conducted more than 100 searches each. In addition, 300,000 visitors to the site conducted more than 100 searches each in the past 12 months. This pool of 430,000 potential users is the target up-sell audience for CoStar over the next few years and it is very large. After the integration is complete, we plan to convert all new LoopNet information sales to enterprise sales only. Meaning that when a firm wants to buy, all the brokers need to be licensed, not just one to prevent password sharing. We plan to offer an intermediate product between LoopNet and CoStar that the users access through LoopNet.com at a price point between LoopNet and CoStar with a clear value upgrade over the legacy LoopNet information product. It will have twice as many listings as LoopNet currently offers but will not have the breadth of information and analytics that CoStar offers. We expect our sales team to work to up-sell LoopNet legacy information users to this new product, as well as to CoStar. One of either. One of the two. In addition, we will eventually up-sell from the new LoopNet product, again, up to CoStar. I believe there is a potential to up-sell net $50 million to $250 million in subscription revenue. About a quarter of all CoStar cancels currently come from clients that use LoopNet as an alternative. We believe that the CoStar cancels will go down after we integrate the two back-ends. Eventually, we would expect to eliminate legacy LoopNet information products to focus our efforts into building industry-leading marketing services on the LoopNet platform. In 2015, we focused the majority of our resources on taking the leading position in multi-family information and marketing. We were successful in adding over $100 million in revenue in the space and have created a wide-mode platform that we believe can generate higher margin, double-digit growth for years to come. In 2016, our top priority is capturing what we believe is a huge opportunity to drive strong double-digit growth in our core information products for many years to come. Any concern with the trade-off we made to take the lead position $0.5 trillion apartment business for approximately 20 basis points reduction on our core information services reminds me of a story from my childhood. My mother came home one day from the store with two new shirts and told me to take them upstairs, try them on and come back down and show them to her. I put the first one and came back downstairs. She looked at me crestfallen and said, what you didn't like the other shirt? Of course, nothing was wrong with the other shirt. I just could not wear them both efficiently at precisely the same time. We believe both that our Core and the Apartments products can grow at strong double-digit growth rates for many years to come. We may though temporarily shift resources from time-to-time for strategic reasons, generally for brief periods of time to pursue the big picture. We're proud to exit 2015, having achieved 24% top-line revenue growth with a 65% year-over-year increase in net income. We will remain committed to reaching our goal of $1 billion of revenue and 40% adjusted EBITDA margin exiting 2018 as I believe I've mentioned. Our $100 million of annualized net new sales in 2015 indicate that our sales and marketing efforts are working exceptionally well, and that our advancements in our service offerings are being well-received by users and clients alike. A number of you have commented that you like the new margins growth and expansion that we're showing with our new CFO, Scott Wheeler. So, hey, great hire. So, I'll turn the call over to our outstanding new CFO, Scott Wheeler, for his maiden earnings call cruise.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Wonderful. Thank you very much, Andy. We have to call you Captain Florance going forward. But thanks for the warm welcome, Andy and team, and good morning, everyone. I do want to say that my first four to six weeks here with the group has been pretty eventful. I've had a chance to meet with a number of investors who I'm sure are on the phone. Also, I got to meet with our sales folks as they came in for annual sales conference. Last week, I was in Atlanta getting to meet with clients and hear from them directly. And of course, my favorite was getting to watch Lil Wayne kick a football for our commercial. Anyway, who would have expected that when you start at a new business? But over the numbers, as Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. The relaunch of Apartments.com, the related marketing investments, the acquisition and relaunch of the Apartment Finder, and our Core information businesses all drove strong sales results throughout the year and they're expected to contribute to the top-line revenue growth, as well as continue margin expansion in 2016 and beyond. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the company reported $193 million of revenue, an increase of 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Full-year 2015 revenues were $712 million, an increase of $136 million or approximately 24% over the full year of 2014. Full-year revenue growth for our core CoStar Suite business is in the 11% to 13% range as expected. Our gross margin was $148 million for the fourth quarter, or 76.6% of revenue compared to 72.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. That is a very strong increase against both prior year and the Q3 gross margin. We've completed the aggressive transition away from print at Apartment Finder and this now starts to show up in the improved gross margins, a margin which I expect to increase as our business continues its growth throughout 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $65 million or 34% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 20% from the $54 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter was $35 million or $1.10 per diluted share, an increase of 19% compared to the $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $23 million or $0.71 per diluted share, an increase of 65% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Now, in the fourth quarter we really started to see these impacts of our cost management efforts come through in the stronger EBITDA performance. Personnel costs were very favorable as we focused on integrating our Apartments businesses and we slowed hiring across the company. In addition, we tightened up on a number of discretionary expense areas and we were able to achieve our outstanding marketing results that Andy mentioned with slightly lower spending, an effective (36:43) improvement in our ROI on marketing. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all the other non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call with their GAAP basis results are show in detail along with the definitions for these terms in our press release issued yesterday and they're available on our website at www.costargroup.com. Cash investments, $437 million as of December 31, 2015, an increase of $46 million from the end of the third quarter. Short and long-term debt outstanding, net of debt issuance expenses, totaled $355 million at year-end. Cash flow generated from operating activities totaled $131 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. You can see we closed out the year in a very strong cash position, which provides us great flexibility to take advantage of growth opportunities in the year ahead, a flexibility that many of our competitors just don't enjoy. Now I'd like to give some additional color on a few metrics to highlight our strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2015. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 535 salespeople across the company, which represents a decline of around 60 people from the end of Q3, resulting primarily from continued integration and alignment of the multi-family sales force. Despite this reduction, we still delivered very strong and impressive business orders and sales results. With Apartment Finder integration and the realignment efforts now behind us, we plan to increase the number of salespeople throughout 2016. Throughout this, the information sales force remained relatively stable throughout the fourth quarter. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was $136 million for the fourth quarter of 2015 or 70% of total revenue. And this is up from 64% in the prior quarter. We made tremendous progress converting more of the Apartments customer base to annual contracts and expect this trend to continue going forward. For the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2015, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $475 million, up 22% from the $390 million for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2014, once again reflecting our continued success in growing these annual subscriptions. Renewal rates, as Andy mentioned, for annual subscriptions revenue remained high during the fourth quarter. The 12-month trailing rate for CoStar subscription revenue was stable at 90.4%, while the 12-month trailing renewal rate for customers that have been with us for five years or longer was 96.3%, roughly in line with the last quarter. So, now let's look at the outlook for the full year and for the first quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2016, we expect revenue of approximately $830 million to $840 million, or 17% to 18% year-over-year growth versus our 2015 results. On a pro forma basis, revenue is expected to grow 13% to 14%. Our pro forma calculation assumes the total revenue of $735 million for 2015, which includes the revenue from Apartment Finder for the full year and excludes the revenue from the businesses that we discontinued, such as Finder Social (39:56). The core business, again, as Andy mentioned, is expected to continue its double-digit growth of approximately 11% to 13% underpinned by our investment in CoStar marketing analytics and the refocused efforts of our sales forces post-integration. The combined Apartments business, including both Apartments.com and Apartment Finder, is expected to grow in a range of 20% to 25%. This growth range represents the combined growth of the Apartments.com business that grew at approximately 30% in the fourth quarter, along with the acquired Apartment Finder revenue base, going forward. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2016 in the range of $196 million to $198 million, representing top-line growth of around 24% to 25%. In terms of earnings for the full year 2016, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $3.62 to $3.72 based on 32.8 million shares, an increase of approximately 80% year-over-year at the midpoint. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $227 million to $232 million with a margin of approximately 27% at the midpoint, an increase of 8 full points compared to 2015. We expect to see strong margin growth in the second half of 2016 and exit the year with margins in the mid-30% range. This increase in margin demonstrates the high degree of leverage in our business model, with approximately 75% of the 2016 revenue increase converting to adjusted EBITDA. We expect first quarter 2016 fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.66 to $0.70 based on 32.7 million shares. As Andy discussed, we expect our marketing costs to be down year-over-year, with advertising spend more heavily weighted in the first half as we resume our national advertising campaign ahead of the peak rental season. Also, as in prior years, other costs are expected to be seasonally higher in Q1 including payroll taxes and our annual sales conference. So, in summary, I'm very pleased with CoStar's financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2015. The relaunch of Apartments.com, the addition of Apartment Finder, the continued investment in our information and analytics products will continue to prove our growth trajectory into 2016. We're also very focused on efficiency and cost management as we drive this strong top-line growth. We will continue to streamline the combined Apartments businesses and identify other areas for efficiencies throughout the company. We believe the current sales trends and the sustained focus on expense management will keep us well positioned to achieve our stated financial goals of $1 billion of revenue in 2018 and exiting that year with 40% adjusted EBITDA margins. So, having said all that, we can now open up the call to questions.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It would appear that we're going to do $1 billion of revenue someday, that's our goal.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Someday.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 40% margin.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: That's right.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 2018 exiting. Great. Part of our new cost saving initiatives, Rich, would you put another quarter in the phone? Yeah, we are ready to open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. First, we'll go to the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Richard Simonelli - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, Andre.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, you gave a ton of numbers. I guess I was wondering how you're thinking about the growth in the Core platform in 2016 embedded in the guidance, given the puts and takes in the CRE market these days? How you are thinking about the broker versus institutional side? I guess specifically, I'm trying to make sure my math is right. If I add up all the pieces that you gave us, the Apartment growth implies about deceleration for the Core business to about 7% in the fourth quarter? So, I guess we'd like get this back up in next year and is the slowdown more driven by pricing or users? I only have one question, so I had to throw a bunch in there.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No worries. So, we don't get the same numbers on that. We show the Core business completely stable at roughly at 12.5% year-over-year growth rate in the fourth quarter. So, it's been hovering at that 12.7%, 12.5%, 12.3% number consistently. And we would expect improvement overall in 2016 that number simply mechanically because in 2015, we borrowed a lot of sales people to supplement the Apartments.com sales force to sell apartment-related products. As we go – and then we merged with Apartment Finder in 2015 mid-year. And that entire team did nothing, but appropriately did nothing but convert people from print to digital for the second half of the year. And that was a large, 100-some-person team. So, as we move into 2016, those folks have completed that task, those Apartment people have completed that task for Apartment Finder and they're now available to do, they focus 100% of their energy on selling Apartments-related business, which gives us the size of scale of the Apartment sales force we want, and that allows us to bring some of the traditional CoStar people back to focusing on the Core. So, while we only saw a few basis points of reduction in growth that we accelerated in the fourth quarter in the Core, we should – as we bring more experienced sales people back into focusing on the Core product see continued robust growth. And then, the initiatives I talked about where we integrate the CoStar and LoopNet back-ends, I believe that is a powerful accelerant. But I believe that we'll see more of that in the later part of the year, so we'll talk about that as we approach delivery on that kind of product. I think that is a multi-year powerful accelerant. So, it could be that when you're doing the math, you're seeing FX effects, you might be seeing discontinuation of a couple of little products that may be small numbers, but from quarter-to-quarter, so there's some products like our product Resolve that we no longer sell that product because it is not scalable, it's basically software consulting services. We like the technology we pulled from it, but we're not going to continue to sell it. It's not going to be a profitable scalable business. So, that one is going backwards a little bit, and that could make the numbers look – it could be interpreted as something in (47:04) the Core. But the Core is 12.5%, which is at the upper end of our 11% to 13%. Now to answer the question on will accelerating in the Core – the other thing in the Core which is not Core to me. So, I define Core as, I do not blend CoStar and LoopNet as one thing. I think of LoopNet as a product, and I look at CoStar as a product. And then within LoopNet, I look at Core LoopNet and non-Core LoopNet. Core LoopNet is the advertising business. LoopNet Premium Lister or the advertising or Loop-like, anything around advertising, that's doing well. The non-Core LoopNet is the Information Services, Premium Searcher, Premium Property Comps and Property Facts. That is pretty much revenue waiting to be up sold to higher margin CoStar services so that one we would not be trying to grow dramatically. We're more setting that up for dramatic growth to CoStar up sell conversions. When you address, there is nothing we are seeing at all in our numbers anywhere related to negative economy. So, there's no anecdotal information coming in from the field. There is no client comment to us. I'm hearing nothing about any negative economic impact right now, and the commercial real estate market is generally are – the fundamentals are very strong, and if there's any economic disruption, it is not the fault of commercial real estate this time. So, and it's also important to remind people that unlike brokerage clients, we do not, our revenue does not drop dramatically in a downturn. So, people continue to consume information products like a CB Richard Ellis doesn't cancel their in-place contract because their revenues drop, should they drop – they are not driving, but should they drop. And in the worst we ever saw was in this 50-year low watermark for the commercial real estate market was a 3% decline in revenues for the year after which we saw a strong return. In the 2001 downturn, we saw – we did not see a decline. We just kept growing. So, we have brokerage firms revenues going down in that decline, we kept going up. So, we do not have any indication today of any slowdown in the Core or negative economic. And should there be a negative economic in the future, it's not coming from commercial office, industrial, retail, real estate for sure. And should that occur, it is – we're not highly cyclical like our traditional customers. Now, the other thing is that brokers are very important to us personally. They're less and less important to us as a revenue stream. So, when we went public, they were 80% of our revenues. Today, they're 29% of our revenues. And our revenues are diversified across banks, governments, property managers, owners, institutional investors, CMBS investors, power companies. Just all kinds of folk. So, we're not – we do not go as a large brokerage firm goes. So, you asked a multi-compound question. Hopefully I answered a compound answer, too long. Okay.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You did. Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's try and wrap this call up before 3:00 o'clock. I'm sorry.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Sara Gubins with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Richard Simonelli - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a couple of real quick ones. Could you quantify the headwinds from Services at Apartment Finder that you're shutting down in 2016 numbers? Would you characterize ad spend as being down $20 million in 2016 or was there some shift from the fourth quarter into the New Year? And then the contract sales were fantastic but they were sequentially down from the third quarter, so I just wanted to get your take on that. Thanks.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, simply put, what happened was we are taking the 2016 spend on marketing around the Apartment space down $20 million over the comparative numbers from 2015. The cost savings you saw in the quarter – in the fourth quarter were largely elimination of redundant positions, and that's probably, the single biggest beginning, middle and end of it.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Over two-thirds of it was from personnel-related costs.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. 200-some people.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Very small amount was from the marketing piece in Q4.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we think that's something that you'll see that the reduction in marketing spend, though, remember, at a reduced number, we are still the most aggressive player by a wide margin, and as you can tell like Super Bowl ads and so on and so forth. And we think that will give us significant advantage. And we think the marketing dollars at the lower level we are spending are highly efficient because if you're not competing with multiple other voices attempting to brand a similar product in the national space, you have very efficient dollars – there's very efficient dollars you're spending. So, in the fourth quarter, remember one of the things that was occurring. So, you asked about the Finder discontinuation of revenue, that number was $10 million, $13 million, something like that.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. It was roughly around that.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: $10 million, $13 million net. These were revenues – this was revenue that just in the long term would distract us from other higher margin revenue. So, it was negative or a flat margin revenue that couldn't scale and we thought it was frankly competitive and distracting, so we took that away to focus on the Core. So, you'll get a little bit of tailwind on that. Now, remember – a little headwind on that. But just year-over-year basis. Now, remember that we went in to Apartment Finder really aggressively. So, we were not messing around and other companies have done print to digital conversions in the course of two or three years. We did a – I'm sorry. A print to digital. We did a print to digital in four months. So, we want to be really quick about it. And we took 100 and some Apartment Finder sales people and said, go to your customers and migrate them from a print publication to a digital publication, keep the pricing the same, but go from a month-to-month contract to a six-month contract or a one-year contract and do it by next Tuesday. So, it was very rapid. But we did that because of the margin benefit and the ability to focus aggressively and produce a much better product at the end and have a scaled sales force and get scale advantage to these websites. One point of sales, multiple websites for the clients to enjoy leads from. So in doing that, we did have some folks not go from print publications to digital. In particular, you might be in Albany, New York or something, where they love their newsstand book. But we still turned the great results we did despite that, and going forward we're in a much better place than if we kept messing around with print. I hope that answered the question.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. The last one was just new contract sales trends.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's the new contract sales. There's a slight reduction there.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Oh, got it. Got it.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We lost contracts when we lose that company in Albany that really wanted a book.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Makes sense. Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're not big believers in the book. Okay.
Operator: And next we'll go the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good afternoon, everyone.
Richard Simonelli - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good afternoon.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Well, a question for you on the new CoStar product, the inter-media product going between LoopNet and CoStar Suite. I don't know, you have a name for it or is it CoStar Light, something like that?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Do you have a name for it?
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And so, the context of the question is given that product you have your Premium Searcher revenue. I'd like to ask about approximately how much we're talking there, that you're looking to up sell to CoStar Light or to up sell to the CoStar full test. What are the different price points? How do we sort of do some back of the envelope on the potential scenarios there?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, first of all I think you're asking a great question and it is one that I feel that is an important question for the company and I think that we have a good solution for that with a lot of potential. So, I'm feeling very good about that area. So, one of the challenges with the traditional Premium Searcher revenue, which is what, $34 million?
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: About.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Roughly $34 million. Is that it was a relatively low-quality product for LoopNet historically, and it was a throwaway. So, they signed up a number of people at as little as $19 a month, which bears no resemblance to what CoStar charges for a higher quality information product. As the LoopNet brand has strengthened, the information has gotten better in LoopNet and they're getting a lot more value than they're paying for. Now, you can't increase anybody from $17 to anything meaningful at any kind of other than usurious interest rate kind of growth rate. So, it's not a great approach. So, we are creating a new product, so we will – those folks who have Premium Searcher can see both basic and premium listings on LoopNet. Once we do the conversion, the only people that are going to be able to originate basic listings on LoopNet will be people who are paying to advertise with us, at least some property. That means some of the basic listings will disappear reducing the value of the legacy product, somewhat. And we are offering the up sell product, which has twice the listing volume and more accurate listings as the legacy LoopNet product. We'll be offering that for probably in the $195 to $295 a month per person price range. The current legacy product, it was running at $115 average per month. Now, that average is very average because as you know, we took the price up to about $325 or something a month, about a year or so ago, so that $115 is a blend of the $17 person and the $325 person.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And also, it's not apples to apples. It's comparing yens to pounds because a user at CoStar Group has an enterprise license where all the brokers of the site need to be licensed before the first broker gets the service. On the legacy LoopNet, one broker in a 100-shop brokerage firm might be the guy who bought the password and shares it with the entire office. So that $34-a-month account might be servicing 100 brokers. So, as we bring the new products on board, it will only be licensed at the enterprise site level, and it will be moving up to a higher price point. So, it'll be significant up from where we are before. So, it's probably a – if someone chooses to get the more robust intermediate information products through the LoopNet platform, on average, it will likely be a 300% price increase or so. And we think it will be compelling to people because we'll use exactly the same methodology LoopNet used to get people from just using the free LoopNet to the Premium Searcher LoopNet where every search you do, you can actually see how much content you're not seeing if you're not in the premium class. And then the CoStar service is probably another 60% increase above the intermediate service. So, we'll move people between these different price points with very clear and very discernible value proposition. So, I'm very excited about it. There's a lot of software work to do this year, but clearly our team is pretty darn good at doing that. And we're – they'll hit this one as aggressive as they hit Apartments.com, and as aggressive as they hit Apartment Finder. And then I'm really excited about what we're going to deliver to our CoStar sales force. And then ultimately by coming up with a clear branding message around LoopNet that it's a marketing vehicle like Apartments.com is, we will ultimately, I believe, sell a lot more marketing revenue as well. And you didn't ask, but there, that's also another pricing opportunity because our average broker-client pays $17 per month for an ad on LoopNet. Whereas when we sell to owners they pay on average $400 or $500 and we're going to be moving more towards that, so.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Wow. Okay. Well excellent. I appreciate the...
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think you wanted (61:47) numbers. I don't know if that helps?
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: I appreciate the insight. And I also want to say welcome aboard to Scott Wheeler.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you very much. Great to be here. Look forward to meeting you soon.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We call him – around CoStar, we call him continuous-margin-expansion-Scott. Is there an acronym for that yet?
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: CMX (62:09)?
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC: It's actually Darren Jue on for Sterling.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon, Darren.
Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC: My question is about how you guys think about prioritizing spending between the Apartments.com and the Apartment Finder brands? And then like how do you see the growth rates of those two brands trending, do they sort of converge in terms of growth rates over the long term?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Good question. They are – we are prioritizing the branding spend around Apartments.com. So we put all the major media dollars into Apartments.com. And then – but we can leverage that investment, Apartments.com, to Apartment Finder or to Apartment Home Living in that, as someone is acquired by Apartments.com, we cookie them. And when they search for – this is an example – they search for a pet friendly, one bedroom in Cleveland Park in D.C., we know that. And then we retarget them, we spend digital dollars retargeting them, saying that Apartment Finder is the ideal site to find a dog friendly apartment in Cleveland Park. And that's very successful. We capture a lot of traffic by – and what we're trying to do there, is a typical renter goes to two, three, four sites, and we would like to be half the sites they go to by moving them around through retargeting and so on and so forth. And then, the product is being sold – we are not, when we go out there today, we're not selling Apartments.com and we're not selling exposure on Apartment Finder, we're selling exposure on the Apartment Network. And that allows us to leverage the entire sales force across one clean selling message. It's much more efficient. Otherwise, you'd have to have two competing sales forces. The clients don't want that. The clients really like being able to pay one price and move across a whole network of websites. And the nice thing is, there was not a ton of redundant client base between Finder and Apartments.com. So, what we did is we really just increased share and then we're trying to move the overall forward.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. I think it's an important message to bring up because as we move forward into this year, as we're selling this network through the sales force, there's not going to be a visible separation between Apartment Finder and Apartments.com from a revenue growth perspective. So, when I gave the guidance of look for 20% to 25% combined growth going forward, that's all of our apartments, properties together in this network cell. And it is exactly at or slightly above the growth rates on an organic basis we're seeing coming out of the end of 2015.
Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And just to clarify, the 20% to 25% growth, is that a pro forma growth, assuming that you had Apartment Finder for the full year in 2015?
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. That's right. That's assuming that. And the number I gave, I think, was $735 million as the pro forma base that we grow off of in total, it includes that 20% to 25% Apartment.
Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And we believe that combined business will be profitable in the fourth quarter.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. It is afternoon now. How are you doing, Andy?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Welcome, Scott, look forward to working with you.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Great. You, too, Andrew. Thank you.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I guess what I'm to trying wrap my head around a little bit, kind of going back to Andre's question at the beginning of the Q&A session. Net new has historically been our best look-forward metric. It has accelerated to pretty remarkable levels, reminiscent of LoopNet coming out of the last recession. And yet, the implied rev guide for 2016 doesn't seem to capture that implied acceleration. So, I'm wondering if net new isn't the best sort of forward-looking metric anymore, or if there were some puts or takes or how we should think about your guidance vis-à-vis bookings growth and, perhaps, some conservatism? I'm just – give me a breakdown on the relationship, is what I'm trying to understand better.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: It's a good question. I think as you think of – the net new is still the metric we'll be using in the annual subscriptions to show how that turns obviously into revenue in the future. The other thing we all have to get used to is now that we've got a really big multi-family Apartments business, it demonstrates a different seasonal pattern in its new and subscription revenue from quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, there's a peak season in the second and the third quarter for renting and then that cools off. That pattern is going to hold true for the sales efforts. It's also going to hold true for our marketing efforts. So, from what we've been used to in the past, we're going to see a more seasonal pattern that's decent in the first quarter, it grows second quarter, third quarter and then it softens in the fourth quarter when you look at apartment selling. So, when you peel all those pieces apart and we look sequentially and forward, each of the individual components, seasonality aside, continues to grow and will continue to grow in each quarter next year over the prior quarter. I know it's difficult to see because until we get annual periods of all this stuff in place, it's not as clear. But that's what we're seeing in the underlying metrics in the new business that we're putting on and then that's translating into consistent sequential growth going forward.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I think – I do think that it is the best single indicator of future revenue and expectations. You do have a lot happening. So, you have the Finder conversion really coming to a head in the fourth quarter, where we did record reductions. We had the shutdowns of revenue. So, that moving Finder through in essence in a three-month period creates a little bit of noise. And then I think that we're not looking to be overly aggressive as we go into 2016. We would like to see us continue to put up these unusually strong sales results ongoing. And not – don't want to speak on behalf of Scott but coming in to the new CFO role you wouldn't amp up all the dials from the prior year with your over four weeks of high confidence.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you for that good introduction.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So you wouldn't call out for example any inflation in the net new number which is resulting from the conversion of less than annual terms to annual terms, which would otherwise blunt future revenue growth, in other words, better retention, better economics but maybe less related revenue growth?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. And I believe our apartment renewal rates are doing really well. I think we're going to do a lot better in the apartment renewal rates than anyone in our industry has ever done. And anecdotally, there was one client that you would – we're bringing a lot to the table for the clients right now and so we have a much stronger hand or much stronger product than anyone has had in this space before. And there's one client that sticks in my mind that we saw a reduction in their spend, it was a major national player. Was the only major national player I was aware that we saw a reduction in their spend in the later part of the year, but they've actually brought that right back up online and above. So, I actually think our renewal rate in the Apartment side is pretty darn good. We'll be working hard to keep it up there, and I think it probably ends up being stronger than the LoopNet renewal rate. It's somewhere between the LoopNet and CoStar, and that makes that net bookings number actually a good fair representation of what's happening in the business. But don't- they're so – when you discontinue all that Finder Social on the fourth quarter, you take negative net news for terminating a book ad campaign in Albany. There's a little bit of noise there, but the big – and it's happening so quickly. I mean, remember, this is all accelerated in the last three quarters. But I'd say it's still the best indicator.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Michael Huang with Needham. Please go ahead.
Michael S. Huang - Needham & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning, guys. Just a quick one for you. So, with respect to the annual sales conference that you – that you hosted, what were the key takeaways? And could you share how you're thinking about ramping head count across the product areas and maybe the profile of who you are hiring, and whether or not that's any different than kind of who you hired in the past? Thanks.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, well, one really nice thing about the sales conference was that I felt that there was really good energy and integration between the CoStar sales team, the Apartments.com sales team and the Apartment Finder sales team. So, this was the first time they all got an opportunity to get to the same room. And it was the first time that they had one relatively common set of products and it was also the first time that they had a really good – I think a really good territory system they get a hold of. So they could understand what their mission was in this collection of products. So, I felt there was really good energy. I thought there was a little bit of a morphing of the personalities as they, three different sales forces into a more corporate central casting, send me a high-end sales person look. I mean they were really dressed up. But the expansion areas would be we're adding customer relationship management people that the CoStar information sales team, about 80 people there. They have some selling responsibilities, but their core responsibility is driving usage. They're selling responsibility is really more around LoopNet to brokers. So, they'll sustain and drive the LoopNet PL. Then the other thing we did is Max and I spent a lot of time just saying very carefully about our rationales of potential revenue – existing revenue and just set slightly different target levels in different cities, especially cities that we think have a lot more revenue upside. So, it was a really good feel other than a blizzard that came in, and potentially was going to strand 700 sales people on my credit card for three days in Washington. So we had to get them out of there quickly ahead of the storm, and we only had to pick up the tab for about 30 Brits for the weekend, so, it turned out okay.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: We'll also see the territories were aligned closely now in Apartments, and we have a couple extra regions we've done and a couple hundred territories that we've now aligned with the combined sales force. You're going to expect those number of territories will need to put more folks against. And so, that's the other piece besides the customer relationship piece that Andy mentioned. We'll see more sales force in multi-family going out to those territories.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Good afternoon. And welcome, Scott.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Brett.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Andy, can you talk about lead quality? You mentioned kind of you're expecting high renewal rates from the multi-family folks, the investment you all made in getting real time availability, I think, sort of was the game changer you're going after – it was supposed to produce higher quality of leads. Can you give us if it's a metric or anecdotes just to compel us that that's working as you've expected and that it is – the leads are higher quality?
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, again, there's not a – there is no sort of third party lead monitoring service that puts out a – a metric that we can use. But I can take an anecdotal from our biggest customers where they are watching that lead flow and they're saying that one customer, one major customer said, look, you all came in in March of last year saying you're going to have this great traffic and great lead flow and you want us to immediately switch all our advertising to you after we have been doing this for 30 years. And so, we're not going to do that until we've watched results for a period of time. And they said that, they said, and it's consistent with what others are saying, that as they monitor it, they see a clear and growing differentiation between the leads they received from us and lead is a dirty word. Is what you're really looking for is lease. And so, the leases they're seeing come from us is differentiated from all the other sources. Which is why they're spending, as you can see, from any – just pretty clear there's a major shift from other sources to us, that is the best testament of lead quality. But we did an interesting study the other day and you'd go back to the old manual way of trying to lease out your apartment building. We know from digitally tracking the results of over 10 million phone calls into apartment communities in 2015, they only answer the telephone during normal business hours 27% of the time. So, they're only available to give somebody information on apartment 27% of the time and then working on a special project that we made 1,500 calls, that were all recorded legally, and that a separate person and each community was called and asked for a one bedroom availability by two different people. Each call was recorded, and then a third party determined whether or not an accurate answer was given on whether or not there's availability. The accuracy rate for when you call an apartment community and whether or not they have a one bedroom availability is 50%. So, when you call and ask the community if they have a one bedroom available, they're only able to give the right answer 50% of the time. So, you're down to, for every 100 calls that come in only 13.5 of them are answered correctly. So, the only way the industry's going to lease stuff up is through digital presentation right from the property management systems to the customer. So, what we're doing is we're giving consumers real information as to what's available. We're making it readily accessible. We're not playing any games where we serve up apartments that aren't in the neighborhoods they asked for. We're not playing any games where we serve up apartments that are not available. So, the quality of our lead flow would follow is much better. And I think that's just is evidence. My belief is that the competing companies are seeing significant reductions in revenue other than whatever they could pick up in the print to digital conversion volatility. I think they're seeing negative numbers and that basically follows from a lead flow.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. That's great. That's what I need. I appreciate the detail.
Operator: And our final question will come from the line of Peter Lowry with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Oh, great. Thanks. Just one quick one. Can you give us an update on your current M&A stance or other capital allocation plans? Thanks.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, I would, I'd have to say there's more potential initiatives that we could pursue than I've ever seen before. There's a wide array, and they lie in our traditional business area, in the Core business area. They also are in the Apartments area. And then they're in related areas. We also separately are looking at smaller acquisition opportunities in Europe. But – so, we obviously – with growing cash balances and very conservative debt posture we have capacity. But I would not want to let anything right now interfere with our core priority of integrating LoopNet and CoStar. So, whatever happens, the first priority is getting the benefit integration done. And so, we're probably operationally adverse to adding additional workload for at least six months. But we – Frank Carchedi who's been with us for a long, long time, he's one of four CFOs that hang around here, former CFOs that hang around here, he has handed off his responsibilities for our very large research department and he's focusing on some of our subsidiaries and he's focusing on M&A. So, he's spending a lot more time on that. We are looking at a lot of things. But again, priority number one is operations and realizing the benefit of the resources and assets we already have.
Peter C. Lowry - JMP Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Andrew C. Florance - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. So, what the heck? We're going to break the rules. We have one more question from Sara and then we're going to move to the second quarter results.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. So, I just want to clarify what the Apartments' guidance that you gave for 2016. You've been talking about 25% to 30% before. And I think that referred just to Apartment.com and you're now including Apartment Finder and probably some of the products shut down that's impacting in 2016. Is that the reason for the lower growth versus the 25% to 30% that you talked about before?
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, Sara that's exactly it. When we talked in the last quarter, we said 25% to 30% for Apartments.com. And until we finish the wind-off of Finder, we didn't have a good base to start using in our go-forward organic growth calculations to know what that combine business is going to be. Now, as you point out, we have that clarity, we know where it's running. You combine the 30% from Apartments.com with the remaining base of Apartment Finder and on a go-forward basis you get 20% to 25% growth range, which is at or slightly above the equivalent of the 30% that we spoke about before. So, there's no decline there. There's no change there. It's actually a slight acceleration through each quarter we see next year from the "30%" (in quotes) that we said last year. Is that clear?
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. That's very clear.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Perfect.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Richard Simonelli - Vice President-Investor Relations: Okay. With that, we will wrap it up. Thank you all for joining us and congratulations, Scott, on your first earnings call...with the CoStar Group.
Scott Wheeler - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you very much.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the CoStar Group's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. And later we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead, sir.
Rich Simonelli: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CoStar Group's third quarter 2015 conference call. Thank you for joining us. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I have some items for you to consider. Certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those statements in our October 28, 2015, press release on our third-quarter results, and in our filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. And given the last call, we anticipate that no executives will actually cry on this call. As a reminder, today's call is being broadcast live and in color over the Internet on www.costargroup.com, where you can also find our CoStar Investor Relations page. A replay will be available, and you'll be able to access that at 1-800-475-6701 within the US or Canada, and 320-365-3844 outside the US. The access code is 370580. It will be available about an hour after the call today, and it will be online for about a month. So I'd like to now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andy Florance: Thank you, Rich. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for our third-quarter earnings call. We are reporting strong results and growing forward momentum in the business. We had exceptional sales performance in the third quarter. Our revenue in the quarter increased 24% year over year to $189 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $153 million in the third quarter of 2014.  Net new sales on an annual subscription contracts were $31 million for the third quarter of 2015, a 102% increase over the third quarter of 2014, a doubling. Annual subscription contracts in the third quarter of 2015 increased nearly 22% sequentially from the second quarter of 2015. Through three quarters of 2015, we have added over $85 million in net bookings. We had more bookings in the second and third quarter of 2015 than the entire four quarters of 2014. While those numbers are very impressive, they understate the sales team's productivity. During the past two quarters, the Finders sales team signed an additional $30 million-plus of contracts, converting clients from print to pure digital apartment advertising business. But that was not net new revenue, so it would not be in the $85 million I mentioned. When those 110-strong Finders sales force comes back into focusing on pure, net new, having accomplished their conversion task, I expect to see a tailwind behind our booking numbers, our already strong booking numbers. With strong sales in both core CoStar services and in the Apartments products, we're very pleased with this growing sales momentum. Excluding the impacts of ApartmentFinder, our business grew organically at a very strong 4.2% sequentially in the third quarter over the second quarter. That is up from the Q2-over-Q1 sequential quarterly growth rate of 3.2%. In those numbers, you can see our recent booking success beginning to translate into recognized revenue acceleration. Our annual subscription business continues to enjoy a high trailing 12 months renewal rate of 90%. Our core CoStar Information renewal rates remain very steady, at an extraordinary 94% plus. While we continue to move overall post-acquisition renewal rates up significantly for both LoopNet and Apartments, they have historically been lower renewal rates, and when you blend those with the CoStar high renewal rates, it brings the overall rate down slightly to 90%. But it's all moving in the right direction. The core CoStar Information business is solid with CoStar's subscription services achieving a sales booking increase in the third quarter of 2015 of 22% year-over-year. We continue to add to the quality of our service offering with the development of new products such as CoStar Market Analytics. We designed CoStar Market Analytics to meet the needs of property management companies, apartment owners and lenders who need access to comprehensive daily rent and occupancy information. Owners of management companies need this sort of information so that they can set and optimize their rents and occupancy levels. Small movements in rents and occupancy levels can be leveraged into very large movements in value. With cap rates at historical lows, this leverage can be magnified even more. For example, if a fairly typical portfolio of 1,500 apartment units averaging $2,000 a month rents can push its rental rates just $100 a month and hold occupancy, it can create $35 million in value.  But conversely, if it pushes rents a little too far beyond the market, it can quickly lose 5% of occupancy in a month and destroy $35 million in value. Even apartment owners using yield optimizers need comp data to manage and audit the yield maximizer's pricing. We do not believe any other information product in the market delivers adequate, comprehensive, or certainly not timely rent data. Our competitors typically have research departments a small fraction of the size of CoStar's and can only deliver two- to six-month-old data on one quarter as many properties as we do. That sort of weak data is useful as a starting point, but it's not good enough to use in underwriting loans and definitely not for setting pricing. Many property management companies spend a lot of money on in-house research, shopping their competitors in order to get the current rents they need to do the job right. An onsite leasing consultant might spend a few unpleasant hours one day a week secretly shopping their competitors. For each call they make, they're likely getting one half-call shopping them right back. We believe that the community might be spending $3,000 to $10,000 annually per property shopping competitors and being shopped. This could aggregate up to $1 billion plus in annual industry spend of property companies shopping each other and not very efficiently or effectively. Worse yet, while these leasing consultants are busy secret-shopping one another, they're not answering the phone when the real renters call them. We have made or monitored approximately 10 million calls to leasing communities this year, and 76% of the phone calls to leasing offices during business hours go unanswered. Given that these communities are spending billions annually trying to drive calls into their leasing offices, we believe the potential loss of wasted advertising leads is in the billions. We have designed more than half a dozen processes to collect rents and property information. We have a huge advantage in that we have a large digital flow of rent data into Apartments.com and ApartmentFinder. Many investments we are making into people collecting comprehensive pricing data are the same content we are using to make Apartments.com so successful. So we're driving multiple revenue streams off the same data expense and creating a competitive efficiency. For the first time ever, multifamily owners, investors, lenders, and property managers have the real-time rent and sales comp and a lot of the information they need to optimize their income. The CoStar Market Analytics service is very closely related to Apartments.com and ApartmentFinder in that they're all key pieces in the rent maximization puzzle. We plan to sell the products together and gain competitive advantage over those selling just a partial solution. We'll pause briefly there to let President Obama go by. Early adopters are giving us very positive feedback. We intend to put an emphasis on this service. Last week we took steps to expand the pool of the sales team selling CoStar Market Analytics by 100 plus sales representatives. We have sold nearly $12 million of net new sales of CoStar Market Analytics since February of this year, and we have a robust pipeline of deals pending. Of these CoStar Market Analytics deals, many of the contracts include packages with our Apartments network, adding an additional $10 million in net new sales to these contracts, making the total related sales $22 million in subscriptions in the first eight months. Companies like Widener Apartment Homes, HSL Properties, National Property Management, Bozzutto, Hunt Mortgage, and many others are now using CoStar Market Analytics. Bozzutto is a good example of a major advertiser deciding to expand its relationship with us by increasing their marketing spends in the same contract they use to add CoStar Market Analytics. It was only in February of this year that we launched a new Apartments.com site, which leveraged our technology and experience to create a better way for renters to search for an apartment online. In March, we began the first ever significant business-to-consumer apartment marketing campaign in the industry that not only reached tens of millions of potential renters, but demonstrated to multifamily property managers and owners that we were serious about building and maintaining the premiere go-to site on the Internet for the multifamily industry. Since the beginning of the campaign in March through the end of September, we generated over 6.8 billion impressions, with the vast majority coming in the key age demographic of 18 to 49 years old. Most of you have seen the television campaign featuring Jeff Goldblum. It was responsible for 2 billion impressions. We also generated over 2.3 billion impressions digitally; 2.2 billion impressions for out-of-home and radio, and other social media added another 142 million impressions. Our website traffic consumer engagements are exceptionally strong. In September of 2015, Apartments.com experienced a 74% year-over-year increase in unique visitors, according to comScore. For the sixth month in a row, Apartments.com has the most trafficked apartment listing site, according to each of the major marketing authorities, comScore, Experian, Hitwise, Amazon, Alexa, and Compete. That's pretty much the Triple Crown Plus, Plus. In September of 2015, Apartments.com was the number-one apartment listing site in consumer engagement with the most page views and minutes per visit, according to comScore, Hitwise, Alexa, and Compete. Some of the services don't actually have all those metrics. Throughout the campaign, we have conducted brand awareness surveys to measure the success of the campaign. One of the strongest indications of brand strength is measured by unaided awareness, which is based entirely on brand awareness and recall. So we asked renters, or a third party asked renters, if you're looking for an apartment on the Internet, what site would you go to?" Back in February of this year, before we launched the marketing campaign, Apartments.com was at 16% unaided awareness. Way back then, craigslist was by far the leader, with approximately 38% unaided awareness. In other words, nearly four in ten mentioned craigslist without being prompted. At the end of September, we took over the number one position with 40% unaided awareness for Apartments.com. Now it's Apartments.com that four in ten mention as the place to go online to rent an apartment. Craigslist was essentially unchanged, and every other competitor was less than 21% unaided awareness. The perception of Apartments.com as a leader surpassed key competitors and ranks in the top three based on this same study, while its strengths are being characterized by renters as smart, an ally, honest and trustworthy. Our competitor, Rent.com responded to the Apartments.com campaign by spending a significant amount of money on TV with their Legit-a-Master campaign, featuring the comedian, Jb Smoove, gyrating his bits and pieces on an elliptical. In February, yes, that actually just happened on our earnings call. In February, before their campaign began, Rent.com's unaided awareness was approximately 20% at the beginning of the campaign. At the end of September, after the campaign, it was still stuck right around 20%. That's half of Apartments.com's 40% unaided awareness. More importantly with the most current Alexa numbers, Apartments.com has nearly 60 million monthly page views, or about three times Rent.com's 17 million. I have to say that I'm grateful to our ad agency, RPA, for apparently effectively investing our money. A survey of 25,000 US renters published this month by J. Turner Research Company covering the period from June/July 2015, demonstrates how far we've moved the needle in the six months since we launched the new Apartments.com website and marketing campaign. When asked which website they used to find their last apartment, renters surveyed responded that the number one place was Apartments.com at 26% followed by another great site ApartmentFinder at 23%. 23% of the renters said they did a generic Internet search and renters saying they couldn't recall was 19%. Rent.com came in fifth place with 17% of renters saying they used that site, Apartment came in sixth place with 16%, craigslist came in at 15%, and ForRent came in tenth with 12%, for which there was no ribbons awarded. When the response, I don't recall is beating all of our competition, we're obviously pulling away from that competition a bit. Quite simply, the headline on the Apartments.com marketing campaign is, It Works. The impact on sales has been astounding. We achieved $65 million in bookings Companywide in the second and third quarters alone. When you consider the high incremental contribution margin from these sales along with the expected high renewal rates that become an annuity over many years, we believe that the return on investment is very promising. When you look at the story on a more granular market level, the story is also very impressive. Here in Washington when we acquired Apartments.com in 2014, we had $5.1 million in apartment advertising revenue in the Washington metro area. 18 months later, that revenue has grown by 59% to $8.1 million. If you were to add our Apartment Information revenue to that CMA, the growth would be well, well over 60% in 18 months. We believe we are and will continue taking a lot of business from a broader range of competitors. I believe that this year we have established Apartments.com as an absolute leader. In 2015, we've invested heavily in the marketing we felt necessary to properly introduce and brand a great new Apartments.com. We also accelerated our search engine marketing spend on ApartmentFinder to facilitate a successful migration from digital and print revenue to pure digital revenue. We have fielded a lot of questions from investors wanting to have some guidance on our spending plans for marketing in 2016. We can now say that we expect to maintain an aggressive level of investment that we believe is required to maintain our newly established leadership position and high customer satisfaction levels. But the headline is that in 2016, we plan to reduce our marketing spend below our 2015 levels. We expect to lower our total marketing spend by $20 million below our 2015 levels. Reduce by $20 million below 2015. It's more expensive to introduce a new brand than it is to maintain one. We have successfully introduced that new brand. As we move into the second year of this campaign, we believe we do not need the same level of spend to achieve brand awareness and continue the momentum. We believe that the Apartments business will move to even a positive in 2016. We continue to be committed to increasing the quality and breadth of content on our Apartment sites. This is expected to increase engagement and help attract even more traffic to our sites. Our market research tells us that apartment views are very important to renters searching on the Internet, so we built a marketing campaign and contest around winning rent for life by writing a review of your apartment on our site. We received over 155,000 reviews during the contest period, nearly 1,700 per day. I believe that's close to 10 times the number of reviews that came into Apartments.com in the prior three years total. The winner of the Rent for Life prize was Martin Hudak from Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, and I believe he was very happy. Market research tells us that consumers love our immersive 3D virtual tours for apartments with, we're using the Metaphor technology. We now have over 37,000 of these 3D videos on the Apartments.com site. More impressive, these videos are extremely popular with renters, as we've had over 7.2 million views of these immersive apartment walk throughs. It is important to both us and our clients to know well in advance when new apartment buildings are being built. These new buildings are stiff competition to our clients, requiring a change in their leasing tactics. These new buildings are also good revenue opportunities for us, as the new apartment buildings looking to lease up have the largest advertising budgets. In order to catch as much construction activity as possible, we launched an aerial surveillance plane a few months ago that flies over cities to identify new construction. It's a hide-a-wing plane equipped with a state-of-the-art Geoware ultra-high-resolution camera system with augmented reality data overlays. Of course, everyone needs one of those. We are lucky to have a few very experienced military pilots handling the flights and a team of aerial researchers operating the equipment. It's been an amazing resource in identifying construction sites. We've covered 28 metro areas in the US, and in that time, we've added nearly 120 million square feet of new construction. I believe that we will ultimately identify close to a billion square feet of previously unknown construction by the time we cover the entire US. That could be millions of potential advertising revenue. We hope to fly over the country twice a year, though initially, we probably won't be able to go that quickly. Protecting this and all of our proprietary content is important, and we monitor competitors to make sure that they're not illegally stealing our content to gain unfair advantage. Unfortunately and not surprising, we often do detect theft and recently have. We've filed lawsuits before and anticipate again filing one or more lawsuits alleging theft of a large volume of our proprietary data in the next month. We believe the facts are clear and the evidence is very damning. We believe we will prevail in the court of law in this issue and expect to receive substantial redress, including injunctive relief. So let's turn from that segway to ApartmentFinder. We've made tremendous progress at ApartmentFinder in the five months since we closed the acquisition on June 1. Our goal is to offer our advertisers exposure for their communities on a wide array of heavily trafficked rental sites. Adding ApartmentFinder to the family meets that goal. You will recall that we purchased the assets of ApartmentFinder at approximately seven times EBITDA. ApartmentFinder is an established and well respected brand in the industry with a great team of professionals behind that brand. One of the challenges the brand faced was a substantial legacy print apartment directory business. As long as ApartmentFinder had a print directory in a highly competitive Internet marketplace, it would have a proverbial boat anchor around its neck. Most of its advertising contracts provided its advertisers with exposure on the ApartmentFinder website and in the print books distributed across the country. A significant risk factor for us when we did the deal was whether or not we could convert most of those clients from print to pure digital contracts. I believe that risk is now diminished almost entirely. I am very pleased with what Finder sales leader, Marcia Bollinger and her team have accomplished in just a few months. At the time of the acquisition, we had approximately $65 million of the core advertising revenue to protect through the print-to-digital conversion process. And in those contracts, we had to maintain the revenue levels throughout the conversion process. After just two quarters, we've converted this print-based company into a pure digital one. We have shut down the print business and retained 95% of the contracts, representing $64 million in core advertising business. And after two quarters, we are no longer printing books. I believe they printed books for probably 25 years something like that, maybe longer actually. At the time of the acquisition of ApartmentFinder, we anticipated that we could achieve cost synergies of approximately $20 million by discontinuing those print products and other various non-core services. Through September, we have already achieved $15 million of annual cost synergies through elimination of the print business and cuts of approximately 100 associate staff. We believe we'll see another $5 million in various cost savings and reach the expected $20 million in synergies in the short term. As we've mentioned in past calls, in addition to eliminating print at ApartmentFinder, we eliminated various other non core or unprofitable revenue streams, such as social media consulting, street rack distribution services, banner ads, and promotional printing services, including cozies. In total, we eliminated $13 million of non core unprofitable revenue and anticipate elimination of $20 million in associated spends and costs mentioned above. This sort of cost reduction process is always hard on those involved, but I believe that Finder is much stronger now and is ripe for rejuvenated long-term growth. Since June of this year, our combined product design teams have re-imagined all the finer desktop and mobile search products to make them industry leaders and highly competitive. A small army of our combined software developers have worked really diligently over the past two quarters to build these new products and bring them to market as quickly as possible. In addition to building the client facing services, they had to rebuild just about every software system in ApartmentFinder. They had to connect Finder to CoStar's apartment back end research, billing, fulfillment, sales support and accounting systems. I am pleased to report that at this time it appears that we are within three weeks of completing all of those projects. Once we complete all the software, we plan to port all the Finder content and client data into the new systems, test it very thoroughly, and then expect to go live with the new website mid-December. I'm amazed and very impressed by what our software and product teams keep accomplishing. I was CoStar's first and original software developer, no longer the best and have some appreciation for the scale of the task this team is accomplishing here and it's very amazing. Going forward, all of this will integrate the back ends of Apartments.com, CoStar, and ApartmentFinder, thereby leveraging the same research system, support, and sales platform to power our entire Apartments network, consisting of Apartments.com, ApartmentHomeLiving, and ApartmentFinder, as well as valuable CoStar Information Analytics. This significantly leverages our investment in sales and support, product accounting, technical, and research teams, since our efforts will be monetized across yet another major marketing platform. Once complete, all of our Finder and original Apartments.com sales staff will sell the very same compelling network of Apartments.com sites. I believe that only in combination can these two sales forces give us a sales team with the coverage, scale, and experience we need to reach all the many potential clients we have for our industry-leading products. The ApartmentFinder acquisition has been a great success to date and brings a great new team to CoStar Group, and I believe it will continue to help us transform our apartment listing services. The LoopNet marketplace remains vibrant, as we reached 10 million registered LoopNet members. When we signed the deal to acquire LoopNet, it had $78 million in revenue. Since then we've grown it and reduced costs and it now has $78 million in EBITDA instead of $78 million in revenue. As my great-grandmother always used to say, buy them for revenue and convert it all to EBITDA, she didn't really. We should finish this year with about $150 million in LoopNet revenue, so we're approaching doubling the top line since the acquisition. We've got some great businesses in LoopNet beyond just the commercial real estate component, such as our land business and our businesses for sale on the Internet, both of them showing great promise. At the time we closed the deal, all 40,000 LoopNet advertising clients were on month-to-month contracts. Now, today, 33,000 are on annual contracts, 7,000 on quarterly contracts, and 18,600 on month-to-month contracts. This migration to longer-term contracts has significantly lowered the churn and cost of sales in this business and given us more visibility in the revenue stream. We have plans to make substantial upgrades to the LoopNet website in the middle of the first quarter of 2016. We expect to incorporate some of the successful features we have deployed in Apartments.com such as an Apartment like map view, larger main listings, images, and a photo carousel. We want to make it even easier for our premium listers to manage their listings, upgrade their plans, and allow them to easily buy tiered advertising. We have seen some solid early successes from our differentiated advertising offering. Similar to what we offer at Apartments.com, this enables brokers and owners and office, industrial, and retail to pay more for LoopNet premium listing in order to move up in a relevant search result with a larger ad. This provides clients with a need to sell or lease property an opportunity to do it more quickly using the LoopNet marketplace. Earlier this year we began a tiered advertising structure on LoopNet, offering diamond and platinum ads, and it's giving them the ability to pay more and assert higher with a large ad. So we've been achieving, and for the rest of the year and next year, we continue to seek higher prices per user in an effort to reduce internal competition and cannibalization between the LoopNet Information products and the CoStar Information products. Over the next year or so the two will be merging together. Higher prices are having a positive impact on the LoopNet bookings. In the third quarter, LoopNet bookings were up 74% year-over-year and as we continue to increase pricing on LoopNet, we've achieved our first and second highest scores of net new bookings in the second and third quarters of 2015 respectively. We had an excellent quarter, recording our highest ever UK revenue in the third quarter of 2015with £4.2 million in the third quarter. We achieved sequential quarterly growth of 4.2%. Earnings were strong in the UK. EBITDA margin for the third quarter was at 20.1%, the highest it's ever been. All these numbers are a testament to our strong leadership in the UK and the potential global appeal of the CoStar service offerings. In Canada, we now have over $2 million in annual contracts with over 100 clients and 725 users. Keep in mind we just opened the Toronto office in March of 2014, so the uptake has been extremely strong and I believe the Toronto market has a revenue potential in the tens of millions. We just opened up services in Calgary and Vancouver towards the end of the second quarter and have already landed 14 good firms. We plan to open up in Edmonton and Ottawa in late Q4 this year, followed by Montreal in the second half or later part of 2016. We believe we currently collect more inventory listings than any of the competitors in the local market brokers in Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver, and I believe we have outpaced our local competitor in revenues at this point though they've been in the market for 18 years. So the commercial real estate market continues to display great strength. Bottom line, we're definitely in a very strong commercial real estate market. On the leasing side, absorption's up, vacancies are down, and rents are growing. The year-to-date net absorption of office retail, logistics, and apartments was 7% higher than the same period a year earlier. The composite vacancy for the 4 million investment property types stands at 6.9%, 30 basis points lower than a year earlier. And year-over-year rent growth averaged 4.3% well above inflation. Sales volumes at unit data are 20% higher than the year earlier which is within 3% of the peak in 2007. This near record flow of capital to real estate has driven the CoStar repeat sales market price index up 9% over the past year, and it's just capital appreciation. Real estate markets in most geographies in the United States are strengthening. For example, in the office market, 65% of the submarkets had quarter-over-quarter improvement occupancy, a market cycle high, plus 52% of the 54 metros now have occupancy rates above the 2006, 2007 peak. So that's a very important metric and usually we believe is a leading indicator 18 months out of good conditions. Due to the present energy prices, Houston has been the exception, although even there net absorption has been slightly positive for the first three quarters of the year. The apartment sector is performing solidly with net absorption of 4% year-to-date compared with the same period in 2014. Falling home ownership is still a key driver of demand but the growing number of senior citizen renters and higher-income renters suggests the market's shifting to more renters by choice, which could become a very key driver of future apartment demand. Despite a 10% increase in construction deliveries year to date, which might be due to our plane, strong demand allowed occupancy to increase by 10 basis points from a year earlier and rents increased by 4.8%.  Apartment sales volume is up by 10%, with several cities posting average prices per unit well, well above the last cycle. In the office sector, net absorption of 68 million square feet year-to-date is 14% higher than one year earlier. While office completions are up 40% to 41 million square feet, that's actually a very, very small number and strong demand growth has allowed office vacancies to fall by 60 basis points to 11% over the past year. Because of tightening in supply, office rents hit a business cycle high of 4.3% year-over-year growth. Office sales volumes grew 30% compared with a year earlier, which is well above the 20% increase for all real estate transactions. This story of strong demand, high occupancy, and high investment sales volumes is repeated in other real estate sectors, including retail, logistics, light industrial, hospitality, and specialty such as bowling alleys. The broad based strength in both fundamentals and sales has helped attract increased demand for CoStar products and services and foretells a good operating environment for the next year or so, so we're happy with that. So in conclusion, 2015 has been a landmark year with our very successful move into serving the immense marketing and information needs of the apartment industry. I believe that 2015 is the year that successfully expanded our TAM, or our Total Addressable Market by $2 billion with this expansion into the Apartments marketplace. While we had to invest and draw from other areas in our business to make this expansion such a success, I believe we are following a well tread path of great long-term growth companies as we make these moves. Accelerated by the new Apartments products, our second and third-quarter 2015 sales results are tremendous. In the second half of the year, we've begun to achieve significant margin improvement, which I anticipate will continue into the full year of 2016. In fact, we anticipate our EBITDA to move upward by about $100 million in 2016 and by roughly that amount incrementally in each of the next three years overall, as we remain committed to reaching our goal of 40% margin by the end of 2018. Now that Brian Radecki is no longer here, I can actually get the costs of this business under control. That's a joke, Brian's here with us.
Andy Florance: I will now turn the call over to Scott Yinger, our very capable acting Chief Financial Officer.
Scott Yinger: Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2015. The service offerings we've introduced throughout the year, including CoStar Market Analytics and the relaunch of Apartments.com, accompanied by the national marketing campaign, are driving strong sales results and are contributing to top-line revenue growth in 2015 and beyond. In the third quarter of 2015, the company reported $189.1 million of revenue, an increase of 23.5% compared to the third quarter of 2014. The core business continues to grow at a consistent rate, while the Apartments.com revenue growth accelerated to 20% in the quarter and is expected to be in the range of 25% to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross margin was $135.4 million in the third quarter or 71.6% of revenue, which includes expenses in the quarter related ApartmentFinder's print and distribution services, including a $1.7 million charge to terminate the ApartmentFinder print agreement. As Andy mentioned, we are no longer printing books and expect to be fully out of the print business before year end, when all remaining books and racks are collected from the markets. We've been very aggressive in transitioning away from print at Finder, and we expect the resulting cost savings to be evident in our gross margins in 2016 beginning in Q2 after seasonally higher expenses we always see in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA was $35.5 million, or 19% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2015, and non-GAAP net income in the third quarter was $17.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. Net income in the third quarter of 2015 was a loss of $5.4 million. As expected, we reported an increase in all of our earnings metrics in the third quarter of 2015 versus the second quarter, as marketing expenses began to decline following the peak apartment rental season and we realized planned cost reductions related to the ApartmentFinder acquisition. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and all of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the GAAP-basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms, in our press release issued yesterday and are available on our website at www.costargroup.com. Cash and investments were $391 million as of September 30, 2015. Short- and long-term debt outstanding totaled $370 million as of September 30. As Andy noted, the integration of ApartmentFinder is ahead of schedule. We terminated all Finders' social media contracts in the third quarter of 2015 and eliminated the costs associated with that business. Our conversion out of the print business is nearly complete as well. Shutdown of the print and social media platforms is expected to result in cost synergies totaling $20 million in annualized expenses by year end, seven months from the date of acquisition and well ahead of expectations. We expect to gain additional cost synergies in 2016. Now I'd like to give some additional color on a few metrics to highlight our strong performance in the third quarter of 2015. As of September 30, we had approximately 595 total sales people across the Company compared to approximately 624 at the end of the prior quarter. We are actively integrating our sales resources to ensure that our field sales teams are appropriately sized and managed in each of our markets. We've introduced consistent job titles, compensation plans, and training initiatives to create a cohesive organization across our sales force focused on driving sales growth in all of our services.  Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was $121.4 million for the third quarter of 2015, or 64.2% of total revenue. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2015, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $442.1 million, up 18.4% from $373.4 million for the 12 months period ended September 30, 2014, reflecting our continued success in growing these annual subscriptions faster than our non subscription services. Just to repeat that important point, that's $442 million in annual subscriptions growing at 18%. Renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained high during the third quarter of 2015. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar subscription based revenue was 90.3% in the third quarter of 2015 while the 12 months trailing renewal rate for customers who have been with us five years or longer was 96.4%, roughly in line with the prior quarter. As Andy noted, the renewal rate on CoStar Information subscriptions has remained essentially stable for the past couple of years. LoopNet contracts have always historically renewed at lower rates than CoStar subscriptions, and as we continue to move larger percentages of the LoopNet customer base onto annual contracts, there's a small product mix impact on the trend of our overall renewal rate. I will now discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. We are raising our full year earnings guidance based on great progress integrating ApartmentFinder and the fact that we're reducing costs faster than we expected. We expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in a range of $1.74 to $1.78 for the full year of 2015, which is up $0.10 at the midpoint from the range we provided last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.79 to $0.83, which includes approximately $1.5 million to $2 million of marketing expense, or $0.03 to $0.04 of non-GAAP net income per diluted share that shifted from the third quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year 2015, we expect revenue of approximately $709 million to $712 million. As the integration of ApartmentFinder continues, we believe we're ahead of schedule in discontinuing non-core services, and we have revised our estimates for both the in year impact of these actions as well as for the core ApartmentFinder revenue that we expect to carry forward into 2016. Faster than expected shutdown of ApartmentFinder services is contributing to the increased 2015 earnings outlook, while having a small negative impact on revenue. The updated range includes ApartmentFinder 2015 revenue of approximately $39 million to $41 million. The company's strong sales in the third quarter of 2015 are expected to offset any impact on overall revenue related to the accelerated ApartmentFinder integration. As Andy noted, the ApartmentFinder core online advertising business is now estimated at approximately $65 million in annual revenue as we finish the transition away from print and other non-core services. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect revenue of approximately $190 million to $193 million, which includes expected fourth quarter seasonality in the LoopNet marketplace. The sales results since the launch of the new Apartments.com website and the start of the national consumer marketing campaign have been impressive. This business is seasonal in nature and we may see lower sales and traffic volumes in the fourth quarter. With our clear leadership position among apartment ILS competitors, we expect sales momentum in early 2016 as apartment communities prepare for the 2016 rental season. The growth trajectory of the business and our financial goals remain unchanged from what we've previously communicated. We still see the core business growing in the 11% to 13% range, the potential for uplift resulting from changes to the LoopNet premium searcher transition beginning to become evident in 2017. We still believe we can grow Apartments.com in the 25% to 30% range we previously communicated for 2016. At ApartmentFinder, we expect revenue of approximately $65 million. We're working on our budget for 2016 and expect to give guidance ranges early next year consistent with our practice in prior years. But hopefully, this gives investors and analysts some insight into our preliminary views of 2016. In terms of expenses, as Andy noted earlier, we currently expect to reduce our marketing expenses by approximately $20 million in 2016 while maintaining our leadership position in traffic. In addition to marketing expenses, we continue to believe that we can reduce the cost base of our combined Apartments business, and we still expect the ApartmentFinder acquisition to be highly accretive to the bottom line in 2016 and beyond. We believe we can add approximately 8 to 10 percentage points in adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016 from our full year 2015 estimate of 17%, and this puts us on a path to achieve our previously stated goal of 40% adjusted EBITDA margins exiting 2018. In summary, I'm very pleased with CoStar's financial results for the third quarter of 2015, as well as with the strong sales results we have achieved throughout the year, beginning with the introduction of CoStar Market Analytics and the relaunch of Apartments.com. We're making great progress with the integration of ApartmentFinder and are on track to relaunch that website as Andy said later this year. We believe the current sales trends and plans for continued integration of our multifamily platforms keep us well positioned to achieve our stated financial goals of $1 billion in revenue in 2018, exiting that year with 40% adjusted EBITDA margins and$1.5 billion revenue run rate at even higher margins exiting 2020. I'll now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]  We will go to the line of Andre Benjamin at Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin: Thanks, good morning. My question's in terms of the math on the amount of spending at Apartments. There are the two buckets. I believe there's $75 million to $80 million in incremental marketing and branding spend. I think that's supposed to go down by $20 million next year. The rest of the costs on my math are about $150 million or so but that could be off. What should we be assuming that those costs do year-over-year? Would those be flat, down, or up, and any color on how much?
Scott Yinger : Yes, Andre, this is Scott. So I think what we're saying is that in total the Apartments marketing spend we should be able to manage down $20 million year-over-year. So as you said there are various components in there. There was roughly $80 million incremental spend that we announced around Apartments.com, and then we put some SCM spending behind ApartmentFinder as well. And in aggregate, we expect that we can bring the marketing budget down about $20 million year-over-year.
Operator: Thank you. We will go on to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to ask about the very strong annual subscription net new number at $31 million. And we had been looking for something in the low 20s. And I just wanted to check because one of the beauties of the model is, of course, you get this net new, and you can just spread it out over the next four to five quarters in terms of the contribution. And so that works as long as -- but the only exception to that would be is if there's a component of that which is being converted from existing clients because then you already have that revenue in your model. And so that's my question is maybe you can give us a little detail in terms of that strong $31 million. How much of that represents net new business that was not previously revenue in some form within the revenue base?
Scott Yinger : Yes, Bill, so we net out in that number. We net out prior billing amounts. So if somebody was on a month-to-month contract and now moved to an annual contract, that's netted out of that number.
Andy Florance : So in fact, it is as big and as impressive and as beautiful as you think it is.
Bill Warmington: All right. Well, that's helpful. And the other just this is a sort of note. Are you guys going to be dressing up for the Halloween party tomorrow? Because I heard a rumor that Andy was going as J.D. Tucker.
Andy Florance : It's turning rough when the Washington Post writes an article about the fact that everyone in town should drop by and see our Halloween party because it's really good. That puts a lot of pressure on us and could possibly divert us away from our business. But it's really our field research team that does the really good Halloween party. So yes, I'll be participating in the spirit of it for sure.
Operator: Thank you. Next we go to the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins: Hi, thank you. Sorry if I missed this earlier but what was the core CoStar growth in the third quarter, and how does that compare to the trend in the second quarter?
Andy Florance : That's the 4.3% sequential.
Scott Yinger : 4.2% is total growth. So --
Sara Gubins: Just on a year-over-year basis, if you have it?
Andy Florance: On an annualized basis, the core business in the third quarter was running in that 10% to 13% range.
Scott Yinger : Yes, so 11% to 13% range. The core business continues to be in that range. I think absolute year-over-year was the low end of that range this quarter. And then as Andy pointed out in his comments, sequentially, if I'd strip out ApartmentFinder, the business was up 4.2% sequentially just organic growth quarter-over-quarter.
Andy Florance : And the prior quarter Q2 over Q1 would be 3.2%. So it climbed from 3.2% to 4.2% sequential quarterly.
Sara Gubins: Okay. And then just a question on M&A. So now that you've done the ApartmentFinder deal, should we rule out more brands in the Apartments space? Or do you think that's a likely area of focus?
Andy Florance : Well, on behalf on the 115 software developers who have been staying in various hotels north of Atlanta in Norcross, Georgia, for the last three months, I am not going to say we're about to do something else. They would like to have a little break after finishing this integration job. But I think that this probably has changed the calculus a little bit so that I think it would now look like we have been able to integrate in another good brand in the apartment space, get good reaction from the customers, retain the revenue, and achieve significant cost efficiencies. So I would definitely, as you look at other deals, they would obviously have to be priced correctly. We would want to capture the value for our capabilities ourselves, not give them to someone selling a business. But I would feel much more comfortable about our ability to do these deals and manage the risks of conversion. There are opportunities, but there's nothing specific right now.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey: Thank you, good morning. Rich, actually, I was hoping to hear you cry on this call, but maybe next quarter.
Rich Simonelli: There's still time.
Andy Florance : I'm thinking then we'd all cry.
Andrew Jeffrey: True. With regard to the EBITDA growth cadence and appreciate your color on 2016, as we think about the 2018 target of 40% exit margin, is it going to be pretty radical, the EBITDA growth improvement or the margin improvement, 2016, 2017, and 2018? Or would you anticipate more of a hockey stick as we get closer to the end of that three year period?
Scott Yinger : Well, this is Scott, Andrew. I think the guidance we just gave you I think will show you that we're making pretty steady progress next year. And exactly what the trajectory is beyond that, it's hard for me to give any detailed guidance on it. But I think it's fairly steady. Quarter-to- quarter it will vary based on the seasonality of the marketing and things like that. So I don't think every quarter it's up and to the right by a fixed percentage. But annually, I think we gave you a pretty good point. I think we -- I just said I thought we could be up 8% to 10% margin points next year. And I think if you plot that out over the next couple of years it gets you to that 40% exiting 2018.
Operator: Thank you. Next we go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Sterling Auty: Yes, thanks, hi, guys. You gave a number of points around kind of macro supply et cetera. I just wanted to see if you could tie them together in terms of how do you feel where we are in terms of the cycle? And you talked about the plane flying over and isolating construction. But how do you see the timing of new construction coming in impacting 2016?
Andy Florance : I think our thought is that, first of all, it's great news for Apartments.com and for ApartmentFinder to have that construction coming in because those folks tend to buy our most expensive ad packages, so that's a good driver there. There's definitely concerns out there about the amount of construction on the multifamily space specifically, and with incomes being relatively flattened down for a lot of the demand side, will we be able to continue to see rent growth with all the supply coming in? But realistically, the absorption is matching the supply still and our feeling is that you've still got 18 months to two years before you're really going to see any big problem develop. Things are obviously priced to perfection in a lot of areas. The office side is actually, $40 million in construction on the office side is nothing. The other sectors are pretty darned stable. And one metric that I put a lot of weight on, we've seen in two prior cycles, we've seen it be a good leading indicator, is the going down to the submarket level and counting the number of submarkets improving versus the number of submarkets degrading. And right now 65% of submarkets improving. We're still feeling that things look pretty solid. So let's call it a very rounded, flat mountaintop, a plateau mountaintop. Does that answer your question at all? No. Feel free to redirect if you think I didn't answer the question properly.
Operator: Thank you. And we go to the line of Mike Huang with Needham and Company.
Mike Huang: Thanks very much and good morning, guys, nice quarter. So let me see if I could get you to give me a little color inside that bookings number. I mean great number. Were there any large deals in there? Maybe you could give us a flavor for deal sizes and how that might be trending. And then I'm not sure if you're prepared to answer a question like this yet, but given that you're going through your budgeting cycle now, but given the strength of bookings in the last couple of quarters, are we comfortable to call that a trend now? And how should we be thinking about bookings growth rates going forward? Thanks.
Andy Florance : On the first question on this nature of the deals coming in, for sure we are seeing a wide array of deals that are significantly larger than the deals we traditionally see. But they're not like CBRE Richard Ellis scale deals or anything like that. They're just good, solid, $10,000 a month, $20,000 a month deals at the upper end of this. But the real bulk is $1,000 a month here, $1,000 a month there. But that is dramatically higher than doing LoopNet deals at $395 a month. So these ASPs are pretty good. There are a couple of things that are floating around out there that could move significantly above that number, but those are not really forecast pipeline or anything like that. And the ability to think that we have runway on this is high. So we have been like the ducks swimming smoothly across the water, the feet are churning under the water, we've been moving really quickly here, integrating these things, developing new software, switching teams around, blending teams, a lot of things happening here. We're now moving into having a little bit of the luxury to begin to refine and to optimize. And I am really struck and we just finished a round of focus groups with renters, small landlords and large landlords, property management companies in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Washington. And I have to say when I compare what those folks were saying to us two or three years ago, when we were researching prior to our move into Apartments.com, when I compare that to what they're saying now, you would be giddy to hear what they were saying. Like they love, like we really have good products here. They like the people who have CMA, our CoStar Market Analytics, are giving us very good feedback on it. And then folks are giving us very good feedback on the Apartments.com site. Finders still is not a factor with them just because it hasn't had the new site launch. And hearing someone who has -- hearing a small apartment manager who has 20 units in Washington say that in the spring, his craigslist marketing stopped working for him, he wasn't getting leads. And so he started asking the Millennials in his community where they were looking for apartments and they all said Apartments.com, and so he's been looking at advertising there. We're really at the beginning. And when I look in all those focus groups and I see there's only two people in the randomly selected group that are CMA clients, CoStar Market Analytics clients, but they're all expressing the need for the same kind of product, I think we have a long, long, long runway. So as a CEO, I'm more frustrated by the fact that we have only reached 5% of the people we should reach. But I can't be unhappy with the results we've got so far. So definitely, definitely it's got legs for sure in my view. Is that optimistic? Okay.
Operator: We will go next to line of Brandon Dobell with William Blair.
Brandon Dobell: Thanks. Andy, just so you know, I've raised $80 million to spend on marketing and I'm going to go after the things most likely to rent market for me, just myself, as a rental opportunity -- just me. Just so you know, you'll see that out there next year. I'm going to be that competitor for you guys. I guess I'd focus on the core for a minute, maybe some color around, Scott or Andy, your comments around that 11% to 13% being sustainable. But more importantly, how you get that to drift towards the 13% as opposed to letting it drift down to 9% or 10%.
Andy Florance : Yes, sure. So it's a good question and we say the core at some point in the next couple of quarters, we're going to probably have to redefine what the core is. Because ultimately the core will probably be defined as LoopNet information products, CoStar information products, LoopNet marketing products, and then CoStar advertising products being one set the way to look at Apartments. So you've got to break out the CoStar Market Analytics targeting multifamily maybe. Okay so the core probably will ultimately involve LoopNet and CoStar. Now there's no question about when we made this commitment a year and a half ago to go into Apartments.com and to really try to expand our addressable market by taking share in this relatively new area, we definitely gave up the ability to get two or three extra points in our core business while it took your sales leadership, your software leadership, everyone to try to grow the scope of the long-term opportunity. So as you can tell from this call, we're feeling that we've made very good progress in this and there are like a bunch of different ways to measure that we're now number one. And you can see the ability to grow margin in it as well. So I think probably one of our highest priorities in 2016 is to go back and to strengthen the relationship between the LoopNet information products and the integration to LoopNet information products and the CoStar Information products and use that integration to dramatically strengthen the quality of the product and be able to take what is today two very large audiences who are very committed, one audience is very committed to CoStar, one audience is very committed to LoopNet information, and bring their resources and their eyeballs and their content into one ecosystem rather than two. And then to also eliminate some of the unacceptable price irregularities in the LoopNet information business. So firms doing $150 million in revenue relying entirely on our information systems but only paying us a couple thousand bucks a year. So that will be a high priority for us, and I feel it will be a good venture. We'll be able to, I think we'll be able to get some additional margin improvement out of the LoopNet and the CoStar business together obviously very, very profitable now. And we'll be able to get some additional operating leverage there. But I think the more exciting thing is we'll be able to build higher quality products, better content, better customer satisfaction, and then we'll be able to monetize that by getting more consistent pricing between the two. Now that's a lot of work and we'll give you more color on it in Q2. And software wise, it will take us through the year. But we're working on that right now, and we're excited about it and very optimistic. So I would be surprised if, as we shifted some of our best resources, or balanced our resources back towards the core, you wouldn't see that number come up in the next year.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to line of Brett Huff, Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff: Good morning, guys. And thanks for the additional disclosures as we look into 2016. That's very helpful.
Andy Florance : All you need is every analyst asking for it, and then we are very responsive.
Brett Huff: We appreciate it. My question is just to dive a little bit more in the core number again; I wanted to make sure I understood what the 22% core info net new annualized sales bookings number comprised of. First of all, is that the right number that I'm referencing?
Andy Florance : Yes, Brett, that's correct.
Brett Huff: Okay. Second of all, that includes what we think of as the original database business as well as Loop as well as the cross sales of the new market analytics business all in there? Is that the right pieces?
Scott Yinger : The way we defined that, that did not have Loop in it. So that was basically the core information analytics. And it would include the new CoStar Market Analytics that we sell too.
Brett Huff: Okay. So it's core info and then the new market analytics product. Can you give us the core analytics product, you said, grew $10 million in net new annualized year-over-year, Andy, you mentioned a number and I didn't quite get it. So can you just -- how much of that 22% was the old business, if you will, and how much of it was selling this new market analytics piece?
Andy Florance : Well, the $10 million was just bookings this year on CoStar Market Analytics to apartment-oriented businesses. So it was specifically just that CoStar Market Analytics piece. The bookings in the quarter were roughly $14 million for the core business alone just in the quarter not for three years, not for three quarters of the year. So it's probably yes, so that number would be much larger than that $10 million you're talking about. 
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to line of Peter Lowry, JMP Securities.
Peter Lowry: Great, thanks. Have you seen any changes in terms of strategy at RentPath since they hired their new CEO in July?
Andy Florance : Who's RentPath?
Peter Lowry:
Peter Lowry: Exactly.
Andy Florance : No. It's a good question and we obviously watch that. We definitely observed the change of strategy on the part of their board when they put a new CEO in place. And you look back at their historical activity of, his historical activity of trying to migrate back end systems I believe from Autotrader into the front-end marketing systems. I think that's interesting, but I'm not sure the same parallel exists here, because the interaction between the property manager and the owner and the accounting systems and the variety of systems involved here and how heavy they are and how switching is so difficult. And you can look at RealPage, where they entered into MyNewPlace to try to get synergy between the back-end systems and the front-end systems. And I have a lot of respect for RealPage, but I would say, and they would probably agree with me, I'd say that MyNewPlace was decimated by that effort. So I don't see him executing the same strategy. The strategy that they've had year-to-date, I would say is really challenging because their Apartment Guide is where all the traffic is for them and all the customer goodwill is around Apartment Guide. Rent.com, I believe has much lower customer goodwill. I think somebody interested in URL names pushed the Rent.com moniker. The traffic is on Apartment Guide as well. So they've got to switch the customer loyalty from a well known and liked brand over many years to one that has been less liked by the industry and has less traffic. And again those numbers on unaided awareness so real and the traffic numbers of 3X on Apartments.com versus Rent.com are real. So I'd say they're going to have to think about some sort of reset. And I take them all very seriously. Good people, they're competent people; they're not going to just go to sleep and go away. But so far, I'm still waiting to see what the effect of strategy is, waiting with bated breath. But we're going to keep moving forward, and I would say there might be some evidence our strategy's working well. We're able to try to move to the next strategy and keep one pace ahead. But I do think they probably had a short-term reprieve. I guess you noticed their debt was downgraded the other day. That might have been the source of your question. And from that document you can try to put together the fact that they're not making the numbers they thought they would make this year. But I think they had a little bit of a reprieve because we were very motivated to move swiftly through the Finder integration and we weren't going to print books for another two years in order to keep 99.999% of the customers. They probably picked up a little bit of business from us doing that transition over three months. But that's not sustainable. That's a short-term event. And we've come through the integration much stronger with a much stronger sales force and very motivated. So I hope that answers your question. If not, circle back for another one.
Operator: Thank you. And we will go to a follow up from the line of  Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin: Thanks. I have to jump back in there with the one question. So I'm wondering with the pricing on Apartments.com and ApartmentFinder, I was wondering how that's trending, both absolute and versus competitors such as you just mentioned, RentPath, ForRent and Zillow-Trulia. I'm really just trying to think about how that delta's trended over time and how we should think about you closing the gap, contributing to next year's growth versus the underlying traffic and customer growth.
Andy Florance : Sure. Well, looking at Tilla first, no, teasing. So again, one of our factors in looking at what companies we were more inclined to acquire, one of the factors was we wanted to make sure we acquired a company that did not have a legacy pricing momentum from their print origins. So we many, many years ago, CoStar produced print commercial real estate directories, back in the early 1990s. And one of the things I noticed was that as we switched from print to digital ads, we carried the price schedule right from print into electronic. But ultimately the truth is, you've got less direct costs associated with the ad, so prices can drift down a little bit. And so we did want to -- we felt that there was probably some downward pricing pressure in some players in the industry, so we felt very comfortable going with Apartments.com, which was middle lower part of the pack for pricing. And right now we're comfortable with that. We feel that the pricing is one that will allow us to grow volume and volume grows our digital data flows, and it grows a stronger customer experience. So we're less interested in trying to nickel-and-dime each property manager as a client into getting a you know the whole thing where you used to literally, people used to charge $25 extra a month to say pets were allowed on the ad. We're not doing that. We're trying to get more volume so we can get broader and broader participation, we build a stronger network, and we like the fact that we have the wind at our back on pricing and that others have a headwind on pricing. And then the other thing is that we're not just trying to make the money on an advertisement. We're making the money on selling both the pricing information and comparable information and the marketing solution. So we can go in there and have bigger contracts overall but much better pricing. And I just like having the best product and the lowest pricing while we're trying to grow share. And I think the industry has suffered from having these little 5% share fiefdoms. The renters and even the owners would like to have a real clearinghouse here, and that's what we're trying to build. Bill, did you come in there and disappear? Well, at this point, if anyone has any other additional questions, feel free to give us a buzz this afternoon. I'm sure we'll hear from you anyhow.
Andy Florance : Thank you for joining us for the call, and thank you, Brian, for joining us for the call. There was no crying. It was a very good call. And thank you very much. We look forward to updating you next quarter with a lot of exciting news. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

So I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. I'm sorry for the slight delay in getting going this morning, but the city began jack-hammering outside my office right at 5 of 11:00, so we'll keep it moving. And as you know, I always keep these calls very short. As we reach the midpoint of the year, I feel that we can say that our expanded focus investment into the multifamily sector is clearly succeeding. In fact, while our acquisition of LoopNet was widely heralded as a major success, I believe that we are potentially having an even greater success meeting the marketing and information needs of the multi-trillion dollar multifamily industry. In a relatively short period of time we have changed the competitive apartment Internet services landscape for both the companies seeking to provide marketing solutions, and for the companies seeking to provide information analytics solutions. I believe we have brought a greater level of commitment and conviction than our competitors have. We are using the playbook we capitalized on with the LoopNet CoStar merger, integrating and leveraging a powerful information solution to build a superior marketing platform and vice versa. And accordingly we are achieving dramatic selling success. To price optimally, the multifamily owner needs daily competitive rental information, which none of the legacy information providers are adequately supplying. With the benefit of our research and technical expertise in our Apartments.com marketplace, we are providing the users deep content with daily pricing on tens of thousands of apartment communities. To minimize vacancy losses, the multifamily owner needs a steady stream of qualified leads, and to achieve that they need to reach the largest possible audience of renters. By leveraging our technology and content, and by initiating the first ever significant business consumer apartment marketing campaign, reaching tens of millions of potential renters, we have built the most heavily trafficked apartment Web site. We believe we have the best-in-class information and marketing solutions, and by packaging them together we offer the most compelling lowest-cost solution. With that powerful combination, we are taking a lot of business from a range of competitors. We hit the ball out of the park on second quarter sales. We achieved our highest sales quarter, with 34 million in companywide net bookings. That's a 95% year-over-year increase in net bookings over the second quarter of 2014. And we're up 66% sequentially over net bookings of 21 million in the first quarter of 2015. This marks two consecutive quarters in which we have achieved tremendous sales levels. Net new sales on annual subscription contracts were 25 million for the second quarter of 2015, up 59% over the second quarter of 2014. This was by far our strongest quarter of annual subscription sales in our company's history. Our revenue increased 16% year-over-year, to 171 million in the second quarter 2015, compared to 148 million in the second quarter of 2014. Our annual subscription business continues to enjoy a very high trailing 12 months renewal rate of 91%. We closed the acquisition of ApartmentFinder on June 1st. Like Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder is one of the leading digital marketplaces serving millions of renters looking to connect with apartments. ApartmentFinder's service offerings include digital advertising on ApartmentFinder.com, with approximately 13,400 properties advertised on its Web site. ApartmentFinder's core marketplace revenue was approximately 68 million to 70 million for the fiscal ended -- ending in March 2015. ApartmentFinder will remain a distinct complementary brand to Apartments.com, with a unique user interface, but will be similarly powered by CoStar's information. The brand will focus on the sizable component of renters who are focused primarily on finding the best financial deal possible. And these are people at all different sorts of income levels. We know from various studies that most apartment hunters use the Internet to look for an apartment, and most of those renters visit multiple sites in their search for an apartment. By offering multiple online marketing solutions, we believe property managers and owners will get more exposure for the listings; more leads cast a wider net. CoStar expects, by the end of this year, to have integrated the back ends of Apartments.com, CoStar, and ApartmentFinder, thereby leveraging the same research, systems, support, and sales platform to power Apartments.com, ApartmentHomeLiving, CoStar, and ApartmentFinder.com. We anticipate that this will create cost synergies and greater operating efficiencies. Work on this integration is well underway, and we expect to complete it this year. ApartmentFinder has approximately 110 field sales representatives located across the United States. CoStar has combined its sales forces, and already the advertising sales forces are cross selling all of our apartment marketing solutions. I've had the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time with the ApartmentFinder sales force, and I feel that they are a very valuable addition to our sales force, with tremendous selling capabilities and customer relationships. As previously mentioned in other calls, we are in the process of eliminating the print component of ApartmentFinder. Print is a less and less effective way to market apartments nowadays. Print produces a very small percentage of ApartmentFinder's leads, and is disproportionately laborious and expensive. We plan to eliminate these costs or those costs this year, and invest an equivalent amount into digital marketing to drive greater digital traffic to the Finder site. During the process of converting those ApartmentFinder clients that are buying a combination of print and digital marketing, as we move them into pure digital, we will be carrying the expense of both print and the replacement digital investment. This is to be able to show the clients that we have more than replaced the leads lost from print with the enhanced digital marketing. In the first full month that our sales team has been converting these combination accounts into pure digital, we have converted 15% of the business or over a thousand and some contracts. This will be one of our sales team's highest priorities this year, and I believe it's a manageable task. We are keenly focused on expanded online marketing efforts for ApartmentFinder, and it is working. In just our first month of owning ApartmentFinder, a combined team of existing Finder staff and CoStar staff have successfully driven significant increases in traffic to ApartmentFinder, accelerating visits to the site an astounding 135% year-over-year. And that's just for June of 2015. This was exceptional progress considering that ApartmentFinder visits grew in the single digits year-over-year, in April and May. Additionally, ApartmentFinder unique visitors increased 64% year-over-year in June of 2015. In order to offer a simple, but powerfully compelling value proposition, we're marketing our digital apartment marketplace offerings as one apartment network. And a private manager who had been advertising on ApartmentFinder earlier this year would've received the benefits of a site that generated about 2 million unique visitors a month, and a print distribution of a 1000 books -- a couple of thousands books in a market. Once they're converted into a pure digital contract, their apartment ad will run on ApartmentFinder, Apartments.com, ApartmentHomeLiving. Then the advertiser will receive the benefit of three sites with combined unique monthly visitors of approximately 14 million. That is approximately a 700% traffic increase for those converted advertisers. We believe that with this sort of unparalleled exposure we will convert the majority of ApartmentFinder's combination print and digital business to pure digital by year's end. As we achieve this goal, we also expect to achieve significant cost savings. Okay, at this point I'll put my glasses on, which should help. And of course, we're sitting here in a conference that is lead [ph] platinum certified, which means it has no light. Okay, back to the call. ApartmentFinder offered a social media marketing service called Finder Social. The service was not profitable, and in fact was indirectly competitive with our profitable products. After careful consideration and review we have decided to eliminate Finder Social, and its associated significant costs. We believe the ultimate best value we can provide our clients is delivering the best network of digital apartment marketing Web sites, and the highest quality leads that turn into leases. We believe that once we have eliminated non-core ApartmentFinder products, and have achieved integrated operating efficiencies, ApartmentFinder will be very profitable. We use the National Apartment Association exposition, held in Las Vegas in June, to announce our acquisition of ApartmentFinder, and showcase the tremendous value proposition our network of apartment sites and CoStar marketing analytics can offer. The NAA event was attended by 9,000 multifamily professionals, a record for the event in our prime target audience. We created an enormous amount of buzz in brand recognition. We hosted a never-to-forget client party at the event, with 4,500 clients and prospects attending. Well more than 3,200 attendees visited our booth on the exhibit floor. We gave hundreds of product demonstrations of our integrated multifamily offering, and spoke to thousands of clients and prospects. It was really exciting to see our sales people processing signed contracts well past the end of each day's session after the rest of the conference vendors had left the exposition hall. In just two days we signed 350 new communities. Even better was that our sales people came out of NAA event with multiple follow-up meetings for June and July, which have also resulted in sales. In combination, our Web sites are now generating more than 24 million unique visitors each month. That's the equivalent of every person down under in Australia visiting our Web sites last month. It's quite some traffic. For the fourth month in a row, Apartments.com is the undisputed number one most visited apartment listing site according to each of the four leading traffic authorities; comScore, Experian Hitwise, Amazon Alexa, and Compete. We're just four months into to re-launching and marketing campaign of Apartments.com, and we have established Apartments.com as an absolute leader. Apartments.com has experienced a 70% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and a 65% year-over-year increase in total visits in the second quarter of 2015, according to comScore. In June 2015, we significantly increased the year-over-year traffic to Apartments.com, with over 14 million visits, and 6 million unique visitors. Our own internal Google Analytics numbers show much higher traffic numbers. Even more impressive than the traffic numbers is the behavior of consumers once they come to our sites. Apartments.com is engaging consumers as shown by time spend on site and page views. According to Compete, we had more than three times the number of page views on our site, in June, than Apartment Guide, which was the closest competitor. According to comScore we also had 50% more time spent on our site than Apartment Guide, in June. Clearly customers like what they're seeing on Apartments.com. We are very pleased with our success, and continue to grow traffic for our advertisers. We believe that with more traffic than any of our legacy apartment competitors, many of whom are charging more for less traffic, we can take significant share from our top competitors, who combined have nearly $500 million in revenue. We're already seeing good success in moving advertisers from Apartment Guide, Rent.com, and ForRent into our platform. We're not taking our early successes for granted, and we're working hard to move Apartments.com even further ahead. One of CoStar's strengths is collecting and building content. No competitor is matching us in providing the depth of data that our team of researchers, writers, field researchers, sales force, economists, and analysts are able to generate. We know that on the Internet content is king, and we're taking a number of innovative steps to increase quality and breadth of content on our site, and therefore consumer engagement traffic and, we believe, eventually sales. Our market research indicates that renters place an extremely high value on apartment reviews when they're searching for a new apartment. We know from other successful consumer sites, sites like Yelp, and TripAdvisor, that users really like to provide feedback about their experience, and other users want to be able to read what consumers, like them, are saying. Consumer ratings matter. And just recently Harvard Business Report published a study that found a one star rating increase for restaurants on Yelp correlated to revenue gains of up to 9%. So reviews are really important for folks when they're looking at these apartments. In July, we launched an innovative, in fact, the 21st; we launched an innovative campaign to encourage renters to provide quality reviews of their apartments. Apartments.com will give away free rent for a year to 12 weekly winners. Renters who write reviews that are rated as "Helpful" will also be eligible for free rent-for-life grand prize drawing, which will take place October of this year. We expect that this will -- for this promotion will draw many renters to our websites and drive more value for our advertisers. We are combining these objective consumer ratings with our objective fact-based scoring system driven by the data collected by our researchers. By combining facts and opinions, objective data, and subjective experiences we can create a rating system that we believe renters want. One they can count on to inform them for one of the most important decisions they have to make. As part of our previously announced marketing budget, we have also initiated a national marketing campaign to promote the newly released review functionality at Apartments.com. We're promoting this campaign on national and local television, cable T.V., digital, local radio, and social media. Our advertising customers have been given tools and resources to promote the campaign within their own communities. Prior to the campaign, it took Apartments.com three years to collect 12,000 reviews. We surpassed that number in the first 36 hours of this new campaign. At this very early stage in the campaign we have 35,000 reviews submitted. I've read through them, and many of them are really quite good. And that the cost per review, I estimate, is running about $20-$30, which is a really good value. In another technology innovation in the apartment space, we have been adding immersive 3D virtual tours for apartments to Apartments.com site with a technology known as Matterport. It's great technology. Renters can virtually walk through the apartment, and get a true feeling for the space in a unique way that pictures and floor plans do not capture. Property managers and renters love them. We now have over 20,000 Matterport 3D images on the Apartments.com Web site, and we're adding approximately 1,500 per week. We have almost reached 2 million renter views of these 3D immersive apartment walkthroughs, so they're really working. Accurately advising our clients on new construction will bring new supply and competition to the market is an important value proposition for CoStar Market Analytics. And additionally, we generally drive 6000 or more per year for each property in the critical marketing phase post construction around initial lease-up. While tracking new construction has always been a strength of ours, we are working to build an ever more accurate picture by flying over U.S. cities to monitor new construction in a way not possible with Google Maps, commercial satellites or ground based researchers. We have expanded our field research fleet to include a Cessna aircraft equipped with a seriously state-of-the-art augmented reality computer software and camera systems. It will help us survey commercial real estate in a way that's never been done before. In the first 10 days we've completed four test markets. And during these 10 days we discovered and added over 100 new construction properties, 8.6 million square feet of new construction, and 2,375 new multifamily units to the CoStar database. Clearly this will add to the depth and richness of our database, and provide valuable information about upcoming supply in the marketplace. Several of our clients and prospects were given demo flights at NAA, and even one was moved to sign a contract worth several hundred thousands of dollars in the plane, up in the air. Great thing is it was a researcher that asked for the business, not the sales person. Our advertising agency, RPA and a third-party independent research firm has been providing us with detailed analysis from the first four months of Apartments.com national campaign. Till the end of June, the campaign has created over 3 billion impressions, including 1.9 billion digital impressions, and 7.2 million social media ad engagements. As of June 2015, compared to February 2015, our awareness is up more than 50%, with a quarter of the respondents listing Apartments.com in the top four mentions. In June, Apartments.com was ahead of all other apartment listing sites in awareness, with only Craigslist edging us out. In several key markets, like Philadelphia, Houston, Los Angeles, and Phoenix we experienced 100% growth in awareness. Three of four competitor apartment listing sites declined significantly in awareness over the last four months. Equally as impressive is the growth of intentions for Apartments.com, which nearly doubled from 11% in February, to 21% in June. The perception of Apartments.com as a leader surpassed key competitors, and ranks in the top three based on the same study, with the strengths being characterized as smart, an ally, honest, and trustworthy. Ultimately, the best judge of success of the campaign though is sales. And clearly the second quarter of 2015 and June, were all-time highs in sales, casting a vote of confidence for the effort. In addition to the work done by our agency, each of the past three years, Apartments.com has commissioned an independent national study that surveys multifamily professionals across the country about their use and attitudes about leading apartment listing services. This year's survey period covers the first 60 to 90 days after our national advertising campaign began. So it captured the trade's initial reactions to the new Apartments.com Web site. Nonetheless, we learned a lot of interesting things, and I want to share some of those highlights with you. We asked apartment listing sites trade professional -- when we asked folks which sites they were familiar with, the survey showed that Apartments.com is now tied for a first place with Craigslist. Aid awareness for Apartments.com was 94%, up 200 basis points from the prior year, while Craigslist was down 200 basis points. All three of our largest competitors, by revenue, saw declining awareness. 30% of survey respondents selected Apartments.com as the most effective source of quality prospects, while 24% selected Apartment Guide, 22% selected Craigslist, and 4% selected Rent.com. Apartments.com achieved a positive net most effective score of 22% when the survey respondents were asked to select the most effective advertising platform for delivering quality prospects. Craigslist net effective score was the worst, at negative 14% because of low quality of leads. Zillow, Trulia, and Rent.com, all were negative as well. Our net value score climbed into the number one position, at 19%, while Craigslist and Apartment Guide came in at 7%. While other primary competitors, including Rent.com, were in negative territory. If you look at trends on net value, it really points to how well we're doing. Craigslist net value dropped from 31% in '13, to 7% in '15. Apartments increased from 5% in '13, to 19% in '15. Our marketing campaign has been very effective in reaching potential clients, with 93% of survey respondents indicating they had very high awareness of the campaign; can't drown it out. Since the launch of our new multifamily services, cross sales of our Apartments.com, and our multifamily debt and equity information analytics product, CoStar Market Analytics, shows similar potential to the success we had in cross selling between CoStar and LoopNet. CoStar Market Analytics has been significantly contributing to driving sales of Apartments.com. The insights provided by CoStar Market Analytics are extremely popular with apartment managers and owners, and we're able to help them identify rental trends more quickly and with better accuracy. Year-to-date, and since the launch of the new services four months ago, we have sold $8 million of annual subscription combined packages of Apartments.com and CoStar Market Analytics; $8 million of cross selling activity. With a full four months behind us, we are more confident than ever about our strategy and execution in apartments' rentals marketplace. Sales are growing as a result of providing an excellent destination and positive consumer experience for renters, which in turn is causing property managers and owners to advertise their properties with us. A quick update on LoopNet; LoopNet marketplace remains vibrant as we rapidly approached 10 million registered LoopNet members, average monthly searches are up 30% year-over-year. During the quarter, sales increased just over 6 million annualized value of new businesses on LoopNet. There was a component of that that is connected with an accounting change, but the revenue continues to grow. After we complete the software integration of ApartmentFinder, late this fall, we plan to move to integrating the LoopNet land and CoStar backend databases together. We believe this will allow us to significantly reduce research costs, improve data quality, and position us to most effectively migrate remaining LoopNet Premium searchers to the CoStar platform. In preparation for that migration, we continue to seek and are achieving higher prices per user in an effort to reduce internal competition and cannibalization. Year-over-year, our average new selling price per Premium user has increased 45%, from $98 to $142. On July 1, CoStar completed the acquisition of a Madrid, Spain based commercial real estate information provider, called Belbex. Though very small and young, Belbex is the leading commercial real estate data service in Madrid. And we believe that with time we can grow it to become a significant business for our European operations. Madrid is both the third largest city and metropolitan area in Europe, so it's a valuable chess piece in a longer run strategy. We plan to invest in the business, but that is not expected to have a material impact on our overall financials. The new company will be managed out of our London office, and will be led, in Spain, by Belbex's Manager, Juan Menduina. Because of the scale of the market, as well as our leadership team in both London and Spain, I'm very optimistic about the business potential of our growing European operations. Finally, I want to share a few recognitions our team has recently earned. For the second year in a row, CoStar Group has been recognized by Forbs Magazine as one of the most innovative growth companies in the world. Citing our rate of innovation, and sustained appeal to investors, Forbs ranked CoStar number 15 in the annual ranking of the top 100 most innovative companies. Up from, I believe, the 27th position, and ranked us among the top 10 most innovative companies in the software and services category. Jon Coleman and our legal team have been including in the National Law Journal's annual roundup of Washington legal departments of the year, recognizing the company's superior in-house legal team. Our legal team was winner in the big deals category, and recognized to successfully supporting the company through several major recent acquisitions. Finally and most importantly, CoStar Group was named by The Washington Post as one of the best places to work in the Greater Washington Area. We were recognized in the large company category of the Post's prestigious top workplaces 2015 list. The top workplaces are based solely on employee feedback, with a survey conducted by WorkplaceDynamics, an independent research company. Factors concerned include employee satisfaction, with benefits, their job and corporate leadership. The economic strength of the U.S. and its real estate, especially compared with international options drove an exceptionally large flow of capital U.S. commercial real estate sector in the first half of 2015. Specifically, 208 billion in sales in that time was 27% higher than a year earlier. It's the highest since 2007. Fundamentals in the market continue to be strong, and occupancy rates for all the major property types are at the highest level, since '08. Corresponding to strong occupancy rates, rental rates grew well over inflation, ranging from 2.6% for retail, to 5.1% for logistics. Year-over-year gains for office and logistic rents hit their highest point in this recovery. In response to stronger rents and occupancies, new construction has increased especially apartment, office, and warehouse. So far demand is still growing faster than supply. However, with the exception of the apartment market, we believe most markets should see declining occupancy rates over the next year. The apartment sector performed solidly. Net absorption was up 11% in the first half of '15, from a year earlier. A high number of household formations drove the demand for apartments, and allowed vacancy rates to decline to the real estate cycle low of 3.7. And year-over-year rent growth of 3.8% is up from 2.8% one year earlier. In the office sector, net absorption of 38 million in square feet in the first half of 2015 was up 4% from a year earlier, the highest net absorption rate of this real estate cycle. The 60 basis point decline in vacancy, to 11.2% over the past year, allowed office rent growth to hit 4%. A 35% increase in office sales has been especially good for commission-based brokerage clients. The story of strong demand, high occupancy, and high investment sales volumes is similar for other real estate sectors, including retail, logistics, light industrial, hospitality, and specialty. The broad-based strength in both fundamentals in sales has helped support increased demand for CoStar products and services. I'm very pleased of what we've achieved in the first half of '15. The second quarter of 2015 was exceptionally strong, as our powerful sales team is driving all-time high sales; congratulations to Max and his team. We are well on our way to 1 billion in revenue and 40% margin in 2018, and we'll continue to actively grow our powerful commercial real estate platform. We believe we are exceptionally positioned for strong growth and financial success for many years to come. Gosh, on that note I'll turn it over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer. Okey-dokey, go with that Brian.
Brian Radecki: And these calls, they just never are dull. Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we are very pleased with the performance in the second quarter of 2015. The investments we're making in marketing are showing great results with all-time high sales numbers, increases in traffic, leads, all allow the CoStar Group's core business continues to grow at solid top line. We just closed the ApartmentFinder acquisition last month, and are aggressively integrating the business, while providing our sales force with another service to sell to our multifamily customers. In the second quarter of 2015 -- he just does that to see if he can just mess with me before I start, the company reported 170.7 million in revenue, an increase of 16%, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Gross margins, with 126 million for the second quarter of 2015 or 73.8% of revenue, the highest gross margin we reported in the company's history. So the continued margin expansion shows the leverage in strength of our business model, even with the research investments we've made in Canada, and in multifamily. So highest ever gross margins, which I -- we believe will continue to climb. Adjusted EBITDA of 11.3 million for the second quarter 2015, and non-GAAP net income in the second quarter was 2.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Both of which are impacted by the investments in marketing for Apartments.com, as well as expenses for the ApartmentFinder acquisition. Net income in the second quarter of 2015 was a loss of 15 million. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call. So the GAAP basis result are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms in our press release issued yesterday, and are available on our Web site at www.costar.com. Cash in investments were 367.8 million, along with short term and long term debt outstanding of 375 million, as of June 30, 2015. Now, I would like to give some additional color on a few metrics to highlight the strong performance in the second quarter. As Andy mentioned, we achieved 25.5 million in annualized net sales of subscription services on annual contracts in the second quarter of 2015, an all-time high, an increase of 58.9% over the second quarter of 2014. This is an outstanding performance from our entire sales force, and reflects the impact of our marketing investments. We've been providing this metric consistently each quarter, this key metric, and it shows the strong results of our continual efforts to move customers to long term contracts. As of June 30, 2015, we had approximately 624 sales people across the company, which includes the addition of approximately 110 reps that came to us from the ApartmentFinder deal. We are actively working to integrate our sales force resources, and ensure that the field sales teams are appropriately sized and managed in each of the markets. Revenue from subscription services and annual contracts is 110.9 million in the second quarter of 2015 or 65% of total revenue. For the trailing 12 months, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled 420.1 million, up 17.4% from the 12-month period ended 2014, reflecting our continued success in growing the annual subscriptions faster than the non-subscription services. We expect to continue to grow our revenue from subscription services on annual contracts back up into the 70's range in the near team, and eventually back up into the 80% and 90% range of our total revenue. Renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained high during the quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar's subscription-based services was 90.6%, in the second quarter of 2015, while the 12-month trailing renewal rate for customers who have been with us for five years or longer was 97%. As we discussed in our last call, this metric ticked down slightly in the quarter as GE, a long-time subscriber, sold its real estate portfolio. Now, I'll discuss the outlook for the third quarter, and the full year 2015. Full year 2015, we expect revenues of approximately 707 million to 712 million. Based on our strong second quarter 2015 sales results, we're happy to be able to raise the full year 2015 revenue guidance again, despite the fact I just announced an increase, on June 8th. At this point, the top end of our annual guidance range is now 52 million higher than our initial 2015 guidance range. ApartmentFinder contributes 40 million to 43 million of that increase, while the remaining upside is organic revenue growth resulting from the outstanding sales results in the first half of 2015. For the third quarter 2015, we expect revenue of approximately 187 million to 189 million. We expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of 162 to 170 for the full year of 2015, which is up $0.03 at the midpoint from the range we provided you in June. For the third quarter we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.42 to $0.45, which includes the impact of shifting some spending from the second quarter into the third quarter to support the recently announced Rent For Life campaign. For the fourth quarter 2015, we expect the range to increase to approximately $0.79 to $0.84 per diluted share. The investments associated with the marketing campaign are expected to trend down as we get past the peak rental season for 2015, and we expect that trend to be reflected in our quarterly earnings later this year. The sales results have been impressive in a short time since we launched the new Apartments.com Web site, in February 2015, and the start of the national consumer marketing campaign, in March of 2015. However, please remember that it's only been four months. Our models, moving forward, do not reflect continued sale growths at 50 plus percent rates on Apartments' revenue forever. I'd like a few more data points before people start modeling and extrapolating out four months of sales results into their model for every quarter going forward. But obviously we're extremely happy with where we are. At this point, I'd like to talk about the growth trajectory for the business. As we still see the core business growing annually in the 11%-12%-13% range moving forward. And as we previously discussed, we have a target for Apartments.com growth rate of 25% to 30% going into 2016. Based on the strong early results I'm seeing, I think we'll be at the high end or slightly above that range. As we integrate ApartmentFinder, our expectations should add about 70 millionish of revenue in 2016, as we discontinue the non-core products, and transition ApartmentFinder away from print and into all-digital. We continue to believe that we can reduce the cost base of our combined Apartments' business as we integrate ApartmentFinder. And we still expect the ApartmentFinder acquisition to be accretive to the bottom line in 2016, and beyond. As we've consistently stated, we'll be evaluating the effectiveness of our 2015 Apartments' marketing campaign as we get close to the end of the peak rental season, and begin planning for next year. I think it's clear the campaign is achieving our goals of expanding consumer awareness, driving traffic and leads to our clients, and supporting a very strong sales momentum. I look forward to updating investors on our plans for 2016 as we finalize those next quarter. In summary, I'm very pleased with CoStar's financial result for the second quarter 2015, and we're off to a great start with the Apartments.com traffic and sales in the first half of the year. We believe our historic sales results keep us well-positioned to achieve our stated financial goals of a billion in revenue, and a 40% adjusted margins exiting 2016, and our new goal of 1.5 billion revenue run rate, with 45% to 50% adjusted margins exiting 2020. As always, we look forward to sharing our progress with you on these goals in the upcoming quarters. Now, before I open up the call for questions, I have some additional news on a decision I have made. After 18 spectacular years at CoStar, I've decided to take a sabbatical for the next year to spend more time with my family. Now, I know this sounds very cliche, but the simple fact is I'd really like to spend more time with my family. As much as I love my job, I love my family much more. For anyone who knows me, it's been almost always on, day or night, for CoStar, and it's been nearly non-stop work since the beginning. And, unfortunately, with my all-or-nothing personality, striking the right balance between work and personal life has been a struggle for me. Truthfully, I enjoy working. I enjoy working really hard. And all of CoStar's success has made it very easy for me to keep doing what I like doing. Quite frankly, I have the best CFO job in the world, even if it means working long hours. To be the best there has been a lot of late nights and weekends. Spending more time with my family has been something I've thought about for years, but like most of us, it's been elusive for me because work has always been crazy. We've been in the middle of something exciting or about to close the next big deal. But over the past few years time seems to have accelerated, and the thought of one of my two high school kids leaving for college, next August, has had my head spinning -- excuse me. How much time have I spent with them? Has it been enough? Have I been the best father or husband I can be? I can pretty much go on and on. While contemplating these thoughts and talking to a good friend of mine, he simply advised me to list out what was important to me, what I should be doing and not doing, stack-rank it and go for it. So needless to say, when I do this it's pretty crystal clear; health and family comes first, and everything else, including the work I love, comes after that. So let's be clear. I'm not going anywhere for a few months. I'll be at CoStar working with Andy and the team as long as it takes to have a smooth transition. Therefore, I'll see many of you at various conferences, including next week that we'll be attending during the quarter. I'll also be working closely with Scott Yinger, our VP of Finance for the past five years, who most of you know. Scott will be the interim CFO while the company interviews both internal and external candidates for the position. He's been in the trenches every step of the way, so the company will be well served during this period. Really, it's been impossible for me to sum up the words CoStar has meant to me, but I want to thank all the truly incredible people I've worked with, for all that you have done for both, me personally and professionally. CoStar, and everyone I've worked with side by side for all these years, has really been a second family to me. So again thank you all. But mostly, I can't thank Andy enough. He is truly one of a kind; special in many ways. A real visionary and a good friend of mine, he's been amazing. And as usual, we are both on the same page. I couldn't be more excited about what we've accomplished to date, building a great company which grew from a 14 million evaluation, when I stared, to nearly 7 billion today. Resulting in 1800% shareholder return, over 10 times the NASDAQ average since our IPO, wow, that's some serious shareholder returns. But even with all we've done, I am still even more excited about the massive opportunity that lies ahead for the company, and I have no doubt we will dominate everything we turn our attention to. I realize this decision may be surprising to some, but I know in my heart it's the right thing for me today. And I look forward to spending more time with my family and reconnecting. At the end of the prepared remarks we'll only be taking work-related questions in the Q&A, so I'd appreciate keeping my private life exactly that private. If you still have questions related to my sabbatical feel free to contact me directly. So let's take some questions on the fantastic quarter we had, and the outstanding future of the company. Au revoir, Gopher. Andy?
Andy Florance: Okay. On behalf of CoStar's Board of Directors, our investors, and all of Brian's colleagues, and most especially myself, I want to express our deepest appreciation and respect for all Brian's achievements and contributions over his 18 years with CoStar. I must say, 18 chronological years is a deception. Though Brian started 18 years ago, he's worked not a minute less than equivalent of 45 years. I clearly remember when Franc Carchedi, our EVP for Operations hired Brian, back when Franc was our CFO. The week Brian started, Franc and I headed off to New York City to meet with a venture capital, and we left Brian in Washington to run the shop. We left him with a bank statement on his first day of work, with $0.50 in it. We let him know payroll was $150,000 on Friday, and we encouraged him to get collecting. I know he called his wife that day, and told her that he thought he might have made a mistake leaving his stable job. We made payroll that week, and with Brain at center stage we built an exceptional business that positively impacts tens of millions of people, employs thousands, and has generated great returns. And we'll thrive for a very, very long time. This quarter, when an opportunity arose to make an opportunistic investment, like acquiring ApartmentFinder for 170 million or a non-material multi-million Euro company in Madrid, we can do that from cash on hand. That is thanks to how far Brian has brought us from that $0.50 bank balance. Rest assured Brian's greatest accomplishment is the strength and depth of the finance team he built. We will not miss a beat in transition with a team like Charlie Colligan, Don Wilson, Mark Zebra, Matthew Green, Tim Clutter, Rich Simonelli, especially Scott Yinger, and so many more. Scott Yinger, our VP of Finance, already leads the team. And with the highest qualifications, he will step into the Interim CFO role as we transition to a new permanent CFO. As Brain stated, he will remain onboard on a reduced schedule to assist in a smooth transition. We have retained Russell Reynolds, and the search for a new CFO is underway. I owe Brian more than I can every repay him for. He's been a close colleague, a genius, a fighter, and most importantly, a friend. The truth is he's spent more time with me over the last eight years than he did with his family. That's a mistake, because he has a wonderful family, and time is too short. The best I can do to repay him is to wish him well as he heads off in a well-deserved sabbatical, and hope he gets busy making new memorable, wonderful experiences with his family. He will always have a big office waiting for him here at CoStar. At this point, I'll turn the call over to questions. I would reiterate Brian's request that we focus the questions on the business, and respect Brian's privacy. Questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin: My question is actually not on Apartments, but the core CoStar suite. I was wondering if you could confirm what the organic growth rate was just for core CoStar and the LoopNet platforms for this quarter ex Apartments, and then more deeply, how you're trending with just that core broker customer.
Brian Radecki: Sure. I'll start and then hand it over to Andy. Thanks, Andre, 300 [ph]. So the core platform, the major brands that people think about, CoStar, LoopNet, and all that, they're all growing in the 11%-12%-13% rate the last few quarters. I think they're still growing fairly strong. Obviously there's a lot of focus around this recent release the last four months. But as we talked about in prior calls, we've devised a commission structure to people to be filling up the three major buckets on commissions. We think over time that will be -- still continue to be a strong area of growth.
Andy Florance: And with that the reality is, is that we are seeing good growth in the core business, but there is a unusually strong opportunity for our entire sales force in the Apartment opportunity, and that for good reasons diverts sales people attention to those big commission dollars on the Apartment side. So with so much growth over there, I'm very impressed that we're maintaining those double-digit growth rates in the core business.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Sara Gubins: Hi, thank you. Brian, thanks for your comments, and I feel a little bit petty about asking a couple of numbers questions, but I'll do it anyway.
Brian Radecki: That'll make it easier on me. Please do. I want the numbers.
Sara Gubins: I'll throw them all in here. Could you help us break down revenue from ApartmentFinder and Apartments.com in the quarter? Was there any revenue to speak of for ApartmentFinder Social that you'll be shutting down? And just a broader question on Apartments.com, if you're seeing any competitive reaction.
Brian Radecki: Yes, I'll talk the numbers. And Andy loves talking about competition, so I'll leave that piece to him. Yes, so in the quarter, for the year I think we said -- I'll go back and look at the transcript, but I think it's 40 million to 43 million. It's plus or minus 6 million in the quarter. So that's all in the core. I think we've disclosed all that for ApartmentFinder. Their core business is in that 68 million to 70 million. So there's probably about $10 million of revenue that we are currently shutting down. As you approach the end of the year for the conversion it's about $10 million are going to go into next year that you'll lose. I think I just mentioned, we'll expect about 70 millionish I mean, I'm not giving guidance for next year, but just so people can start gauging their numbers for ApartmentFinder for next year. Obviously, once we get through all those conversions, we get rid of the print, we get rid of the Social and all the stuff that we have going on, we convert to the new Web site, and we start selling it, then obviously we think we can grow that longer term at corporate rates, mid teens or so. But that'll be -- it's going to take the next 12 months to get through all that transition, and then start getting the engine going on the sales there. And competition?
Andy Florance: And really -- the Social will -- elimination of Social will increase profitability without a doubt.
Brian Radecki: Correct.
Andy Florance: The competitive situation; frankly, Brain is right. I like competition. This may come as a surprise to people. The competitive front has been a lot of fun. There were a lot of players in the apartment space as we entered it. We have moved into number one. There have been reactions here and there. Our single largest competitor, RentPath, has for the first time begun to do some advertising to try to brand in reaction to our marketing campaign, national marketing campaigns. They've made some interesting choices. The mass majority of their revenue is on Apartment Guide. They decided to spend their marketing on Rent.com, which is the minority of their revenue. Our surveys show that Rent.com is less popular with apartment owners and managers. Apartment Guide is more popular. Watching Alexa, it would appear that there was spending really ahead of the NAA conference and no material traffic movement in Rent.com, which would look like to me, initially, who knows where it goes. It looks like a somewhat ineffective response. The CEO of that organization was replaced last month or this month. So I think that also might be an indication. Then I feel like we're in a very strong position with some of the other players that we're up against there. On the information side, I think we're having -- we're taking a lot of share from some of those smaller players providing multifamily information. I took a quick glance on the iPhone at a red light on the way down to the office this morning, at the only other publicly-traded company providing multifamily market information. And it would appear that their subscription revenue was absolutely flat for the first time in years, and that their revenue growth was all from consulting. And as you track -- have heard the term, zombie company, it's when you move to consulting instead of leveraged revenue. I think that shows that we're taking a lot of share there. And then folks who are in the space but not directly competitive, folks providing general real estate Web sites that begin with a C [ph] and end with a W, they're pretty busy right now on a lot of other issues. We are not seeing any share movement one way or another with them. So they have very little revenues in this space, and don't appear a big factor. I have to say it's been really rewarding to come in, and with our team build a really strong product offering, join up with the Finder folks, and the Apartments.com folks, ApartmentHomeLiving folks, and take a tremendous amount of share right now from everybody. If you want to ask to get back in line and ask the same question again, I'd love it.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Brian, congratulations on an excellent tenure, and enjoy the sabbatical. On to the business stuff, can you give us an update in terms of you talked about coming into the year, the elimination of, I think, the Premium Searcher with LoopNet? Where are you in the process, and is there a chance that you end up doing the same thing with FinderSocial, where maybe it's a wind-down and not a complete elimination?
Brian Radecki: Okay, yes. I'll start, and Andy can jump in. LoopNet, again, we keep pulling the levers. It's the same as we've talked about in prior calls. We've jacked up the price significantly. We are losing some people on the searching side. Again, overall LoopNet is growing a little bit less this year. We got a little bit less revenue this year than growth in the last year, still in that 10%-11%-12%-13% range. But we're essentially getting the effect of what we wanted. I'll let Andy talk about it. I mean, eventually we will move all those people off of there, and make it a pure marketing site. On the social thing there will be zero chance, and Andy can obviously overrule me. Zero chance that we will not eliminate that revenue. And zero chance we will not shut down the print. That is an absolute. We're already staring the process. And obviously we want to get to pure digital play in those areas. And we're feeling great about where we are in little over a month on this.
Andy Florance: Yes, so the folks who were prior doing the social and print are actually have been given their warn notice, and we are actually moving people into other job opportunities, and that is a fait accompli. The only thing delaying the Premium Searcher is Apartments.com, and then ApartmentFinder, and the fact we're working really focusing on that. Again, the price, when we acquired LoopNet for Premium Searcher was roughly $37. Today it's roughly $300. Yes, it continues to grow. By taking it up there, and moving it towards parity with CoStar Property, it will make the transition easier as we do that. Again, it continues to grow. We really want to have the back ends integrated between LoopNet and CoStar Group so that there is a 100% clear upgrade path for all customers. And that if a customer wants to use the CoStar content inside the LoopNet interface they'll be able to do that as well. So we'll make progress on that this year, but again it's just delayed by Finder and Apartments.com's successes.
Brian Radecki: And just add one thing on that. We've got about 120 or so that we've given notices to. Most of them will be here through the end of the year, some a little bit going into the first quarter next year. So we're well underway. As most people know, CoStar moves a light speed. And we've done lots of very, very successful integrations and acquisitions. So I think we're well underway, maybe better than ever.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Brian, I hope your sabbatical doesn't mean we have boring conference calls for the next four quarters.
Brian Radecki: I'll see you in Boston next week with Andy, don't worry.
Andrew Jeffrey: I need more entertainment in my life, apparently. Could you talk a little bit about the growth strategy in Apartments, both Apartments.com and Finder vis-à-vis price? I wonder how much of the blow-out sales growth is a function of underpricing the competition, and at what point do you start to price for value, integrate data, and start to drive some greater yield, or if today and for the foreseeable future, share is your primary consideration?
Andy Florance: Well, we -- in acquiring Apartments.com, one of the considerations was we looked at all of the other players, and looked at their price points they were charging people. We have experienced, though decades and decades ago, of converting from a print advertising medium to a digital information platform or digital marketing platform. And it's common that when someone converts from a print ad solution to a digital ad solution they maintain the cost structure of the -- just religiously maintain the cost structure of the print platform, which has ink, Heidelberg presses, and trucks involved. And that isn't always the right solution. You can actually -- when you have no direct cost for acquiring additional ad, other than the sales commission, it's possible to very profitably go for volume, and leave a player who is charging print prices vulnerable. So you can go for higher profitability at higher volume. And, clearly, the renters have told us they care about higher volume. That's the strategy we're going after. And the fun thing is that it's hard for the competitor who has set a strategy on high price at a low volume to respond to that quickly. So I'm very comfortable of the prices we're charging. Again, we have these differentiated scales, so we have silver, gold, platinum, and diamond. We're intentionally bringing people in on level three, and leaving open the ability to move them to level two and one over time. Buildings moving into lease-up or the vacancy problems move into -- will pay dramatically more, they'll pay more than twice or three times as much to go into the top [indiscernible] position with the most prominent ad. I believe that if you get some softness with over construction, some marketers will get a lot a more share and that people move into that two in one position to create a marketing exposure. And then the other thing is we just have a cost advantage here. I mean we're already collecting all those content about the buildings. We don't have to hire the people to collect that content in connection with the sale of an ad. So our costs are being distributed across the advertising platform and the information platform. So I feel very comfortable where we are right now, and I just think we're lucky as heck to have a cost advantage. And do not be afraid to be a little bit bold and change in the business model up a little bit. So did I answer your question? Okay, I'll assume it did.
Operator: And we'll go to line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Jim Rutherford: Yes, this is Jim Rutherford in for Brett. I just wanted a quick update on hearing what multifamily owners are saying about lead quality and if there's been any change there, and then on the volume that they -- volumes of leads they're getting after switching to Apartments.com from other vendors.
Andy Florance: Sure, happy to. I met with a lot of owners recently with NAA in Vegas, and was extremely pleased with the feedback I received. So across the board, the most senior principals of firms, and then the marketing leadership across the board, everybody I spoke to acknowledged that they were happy with ever seeing a material improvement in lead quality and quantity from Apartments.com over prior year. And in particular, one of our strategy differences from other competitors has been we are not focused on maximum lead volume or focused on lead quality. So a lead is a cost item. A lease is a revenue item. And the industry had gotten into a game where it was drive leads to the telephone leasing office, regardless whether or not that lead was even remotely qualified. So specifically you don't tell the person if the apartment, the one bedroom is available or not. You haven't called the leasing office to find out. That's a waste of the leasing office's time. So we've done, as we're telling people there's no one bedroom available here, don't bother calling unless you're really, really desperate. And that brings lead volume down a little bit. The marketing and the traffic brings lead volume up, but it's more qualified leads. So we're getting -- we are really pleased with what've heard. And I think now, especially for the 13,000 communities that have been advertising with the ApartmentFinder, I believe we're going to blow their minds. I think we're going to give them an increase of leads, like, they can't believe when you go from 2 million unique visitors to 14 million unique visitors. And you go from, again, this sort of murky lead shotgun game to really qualified high quality leads. I think it will work really well.
Operator: And we'll go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: So, good afternoon everyone.
Andy Florance: Hey, Bill.
Brian Radecki: Hey, Bill.
Bill Warmington: And so I heard a rumor that, Brian, you were trying out for the Washington Capitals and you were going to go on the ice, that it could be pro this time.
Brian Radecki: Trying out, I already got a spot.
Bill Warmington: I'm behind. Anyway, so congratulations on that, and we're going to miss you.
Brian Radecki: Thanks, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So I have a question for you on the sales force structure. I know you gave out the number of 624 and that included 110 coming in from Finder. But maybe it would be helpful if you could sketch that out for us now, how the sales force is actually organized across all the different products and how we should think about that in terms of how it's organized.
Andy Florance: Okay. So, oversimplify…
Bill Warmington: It can't be too simple for us for a sell-side analyst.
Andy Florance: So if I extract out inside sales selling a LoopNet in tertiary markets, and I extract out verticals and real estate manager and things like that, these are little sales teams of -- just smallest sales team, which were not insignificant. There's probably a hundred some people there. And I focused on the core businesses. It really breaks into a CoStar information-oriented and commercial real estate oriented sales force. And then in Apartment, a marketing-oriented sales force. One of my big concerns, this time last year was that I did not have as big an apartment marketing sales force as my competitors did. And that was one of our disadvantages, so I was pushed to move the CoStar information sales people into supplement what we had in the apartment side. So the ApartmentFinder acquisition really solves a whole and has been exceeding expectations for the result. And especially it's different about this apartment business than from the office industrial retail business is that, the smallest cities in America play an outsized role. So Greensboro, and Biloxi, and Baton Rouge, Albany, Buffalo, they actually generate material revenue in these apartment sectors. So we did not have strong offices or personnel in those really, really small cities. And ApartmentFinder brought that to us. So it's complementary geographic distribution between where the ApartmentFinder folks are strong and where the Apartments.com people are strong. The tenure of the ApartmentFinder people we're bringing on is excellent. I mean it's not a typical that's eight years, 12 years, 14 years at NAA as I moved from little group, at the party, from little group of clients with a sales person, a little group of clients with sales person, I heard several times that this sales person was in this client's wedding party. So that's fantastic. And what that's done has given us real strength in the tertiary markets and good relationships, and then also, some strength in the primary markets. So for instance, Apartments.com had six sales people in Los Angeles, and ApartmentFinder has six people in Newport Beach, so it tells me that no one really manages sales people down there before, because you can't go from Newport to Santa Barbara effectively sell, and by bringing those two groups together, you actually begin to able to assign out L.A. in a realistic territory pattern. The thing that's key is the teaming between the information sales person and the marketing sales person. That's working like a homerun. People are teaming up. And they end up getting a lot more revenue and taking lot more share when they go into combined offering. And the other nice thing about that is historically the marketing people were gate-kept at the leasing office of the community. So they were often selling one community at a time to the leasing manager of the community. When you bring in the CoStar reps' information, they're used to selling to the C-suite of the organization, and that group has an interest in it. So they're bringing the marketing person up to the C-suite, and it's atypical we are getting a lot of deals with the 20 communities at once, which was prior unheard of, which is allowing us to move so much shares so quickly. Anecdotally, I would hypothecate that -- maybe six or seven competitors we're dealing with right now, I would guess that many of them are down 10% of their revenues this year. Again, I look carefully at our public. I look carefully at the subscription base for public information competitor. I think that this teaming in the sales force is working incredibly effectively, moving thousands of communities to us. So there will be - there is some overlap in some areas, but we want to grow that sales force for the -- there's an unlimited need to grow that marketing sales force on the LoopNet side in the field and the lands of America, which is still are very promising vibrant business with a great future. So I would -- I know you're not supposed to look at an acquisition and say that the sales force was like a real linchpin. You wouldn't spend that much money for just a sales force, but we did get fantastic sales forces here. And I am personally thrilled to finally look at like our Charlotte office and see real strength, see like 15, 16 solid sales people and the real CoStar presence in that community. So we're really a meaningful member of that business community. So that's happening all over the country, and I'm very thrilled with it. It will be a competitive strength.
Operator: And we'll go to line of Michael Huang with Needham & Co.
Michael Huang: Thanks very much. Brian, so have fun with family and good luck with everything. It's been great working with you. This is just a quick one here. So I appreciate the comments around not extrapolating from the strong bookings performance that you've been seeing here. I was wondering, was there anything one-time in nature that benefited the quarterly bookings? And I guess, as you think about the year, I know that you're not going to be extrapolating aggressively here. What should we be assuming around bookings source for the year? Should that tail off a little bit, or is there a way you could walk us through that? Thanks.
Brian Radecki: Yes, I'll talk about. So I'm going to focus on the annualized contracts bookings number, the 25 million number. The other numbers are good number too. There's a lot of monthly stuff that comes in and out of there. Obviously all Finder stuff is monthly now. We are moving most of the apartments to annual, but there is still a lot of monthly stuff there and a lot of monthly -- three-month stuff at LoopNet. So, on the annualized number, which is really to me the key metric that we're tracking, that's obviously up fairly significantly, and that's the number -- I don't try to guide to it, Because I'll tell you quite frankly we're in uncharted territories here. Right? And that's why I'd say, it's four months into this, and I don't want to extrapolate things. I've always said this in the last two calls like let's get through one full year of the marketing campaign, and the sales stuff, and then really know what the trajectory is. Do I think we can grow that number, continue to grow at 50 plus percent for the next 50 years? No. But can we continue to grow at that rate? Possibly. We've never done it before. I mean so we're in the fourth month in, and I just think it's a spectacular number now. Obviously as we keep getting more experience each quarter, then we will continually sort of update that number. So in the annualized bookings number, there's nothing as far as I'm aware that's one-time in nature. So I think we'll just have to see how that plays out. I mean obviously there's NAA. There's a lot of big bang things upfront. So I think you have to get through a full 12-month cycle to see where we're going on that.
Operator: And we'll go to Peter Lowry with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Lowry: Hi, great, thanks. It sounds like the synergies in between the recent acquisitions and the information on the analytics side of the business may be going better than expected. You mentioned the revenue synergies in terms of how the territories lay out, but is there anything else that's been surprising on that front?
Andy Florance: And when you say it's surprising, do you mean in terms of specifically the synergies?
Peter Lowry: Like, worked out better than expected.
Andy Florance: Yes. We initially thought that the focus would be on selling the information product to the asset manager, at the owner, or at the property management firm, where property management is also involved in acquiring and disposing for their clients. So we thought we're showing more of an asset management tool with our product. And what's surprised us was that often the very same person who would make the most senior decision on the marketing was also the person that had the greatest need for tactical rental information. So you go meet with somebody, ensure the asset mangers are in there and they're interested, but the direct VP of Leasing has to manage and understand every day what all their competitors are charging for rent, and they either watch for the people who are raising or lowering their rents, and that same person is responsible for lead generation. So what thrilled us was that person when you could solve the problem that no one else could solve, because no one else is solving this problem we're solving here. There are other people, who provide information on apartment buildings, but they're updating a very small set of properties realistically with a very, very small staff. And they're doing it on a bimonthly basis typically, or a quarterly basis. And we are updating more properties and their rental information each day than I believe any of our competitors update all year long, like, update quarterly. So we're providing these people with really good pricing, competitive intelligence. And that is really compelling to them. And the great thing is they control a massive budget for marketing the properties. And then the other little secret there is that they -- it's appropriate, there's nothing wrong with it, but they have a big budget for marketing these 30 buildings they manage, but the marketing budget goes directly into the partnerships on the buildings. And if they can get packages that allow them to get discounts on information based on the spent at the building, they can get very low cost information of the general partnership, and they're really like that. You could make an argument that you could allocate information cost against the limited partnerships of the building set in, but we do that for them. So in many cases, if somebody moves, there's substantial advertising budget for 20 or 30 properties from a competitor to Apartments.com. They can get free information to manage their rentals and their asset managements. They're underwriting the whole nine yards. And I really enjoyed the other day listening to a sales pitch from a direct competitor, where it was quite clear at the end of the presentation that the CoStar marketing analytics was a better product, and was free, because of their marketing. And the competitive sales person just shrugged and disappeared. So that's the surprise. Thank you. So I believe at this point, we have no more questions. So thank you all for joining us in this call. And we look forward to those who are going to be up in New York for the Needham conference, and for those we are going to see up in Boston in the next -- the day following that. We look forward to seeing you. Again, thank you very much, and look forward to hearing from you all next quarter, and look forward to Scott leading the call next quarter, and Brian making comments from the peanut gallery. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Andy Florance: Thank you, Rich appreciate it. It's not really broadcast in color, is it?
Rich Simonelli: Yes.
Andy Florance: Good morning, everybody. We're glad to have the opportunity to talk with you today about our very strong financial results in the first quarter of 2015. The tremendous progress we're making with Apartments.com, has been phenomenal and we also want to talk about our agreement to acquire ApartmentFinder, which we announced last night. Our revenue increased 34% year-over-year to $159 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $119 million in the first quarter of 2014. We achieved net bookings of $21 million for the quarter a whopping 50% year-over-year increase. March net bookings surged well beyond our prior best ever month to $11 million, which represents a 91% increase versus March of 2014. March's record sales were a direct result of the successful launch of our new Apartments.com site and our new CoStar market analytics product. The magnitude of the March sales jump surprised all of us. Net new sales on annual contracts as opposed to many of the six month contracts that come in on apartments, the annual contracts were $16.2 million for the first quarter of 2015, which is up 10% over the first quarter of 2014. CoStar core services grew 20% during the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the same period. Our annual subscription business continues to enjoy high trailing 12 months renewal rate of 91% with a 98% renewal for those customers with us five years or longer. According to Google Analytics, our marketplaces drew their most traffic ever with 22 million unique visitors in aggregate in March of 2015. According to a study conducted by Kip Cassino and Borell Associates, Inc., apartment landlords will spend $1.5 billion in online advertising in 2015. We believe that this represents a major earnings opportunity for CoStar Group. We acquired Apartments.com, a major player in the sector one year ago in April of 2014. In the one year since the acquisition, hundreds if not 1,000 of my colleagues have put forth a herculean effort and have redesigned and rebuilt Apartments.com from top to bottom. I definitely want to congratulate the team on a great job. In a competitive and rapidly changing industry, we need to ensure that our service will lead that industry. We understand that other competing sites with significant revenue are working with ageing business models and that there is a unique opportunity to reinvent this space and capture share with a more renter-centric website. We believe that at Apartments.com gives renters what they want and need than we will be able to give our paying advertisers the quality leads they want. One of CoStar Group's core competencies is collecting and building content. We feel that renters really want a more comprehensive inventory of rentals including condos and houses with actual rents and availabilities. Prior to the site launch, we wrestled with a number of risks. There was a risk that our development teams could not rebuild and integrate the site across multiple platforms in our budgeted timeframe. There was risk that we would not be able to collect enough content to really improve the renter search experience and drive brand loyalty. Our decision to include paid and unpaid content created the risk that advertisers would opt for free listings where the advertisers would not receive enough incremental exposure over free listings to just for their investment. There was risk that the site redesign would cause existing advertisers to reconsider ad spend with us. There was the risk that our sales force would not have the skills necessary to effectively sell ads in our new business model. There was the risk that our belief that our belief in our efforts to cross-sell information and marketing in the apartment industry would not bear fruit. There was also the risk that our SCO would fall dramatically with a complete site rebuild and there was also the risk that our significant investment and marketing would not drive meaningful traffic gains. Okay. Once or twice I woke up at 4 in the morning during the process of rebuilding Apartments.com. Now that we have successfully launched the new site driven significantly more traffic retain the overwhelming majority of our advertisers and set all time new sales records including significant cross-sell wins, we feel that many of the unknowns and risks are rapidly diminishing. That is very important to us. We're more confident than ever about our strategy and execution in the apartment rentals marketplace. The combined Apartments.com sales force and CoStar sales force are working effectively together and selling successfully. We're confident about our ability to gain significant market share. I believe that our early results demonstrate that our efforts are beginning to show clear payoffs. The launch of the new marketing campaign on March 1, 2015, featuring acclaimed actor Jeff Goldblum as Silicon Valley Executive Brad Bellflower, has been an outright home run for Apartments.com. The campaign is now in full swing with thousands of television spots, hundreds of outdoor placements, a large digital campaign and thousands of radio spots. We can see strong traffic gains as the various ads run. We've received very positive feedback from our customers on the campaign. Senior industry players have told me that they feel the major branding campaign is having a positive halo effect on the entire industry and they're pleased that it elevates their statue in the business community. I think that is a great result for us. The only negative feedback is coming from our competitors. Our intensive B2C campaign coupled with our significant investment in search engine marketing, a dramatically improved site experience and strong improvements in SCO, is driving massive site traffic gains. You'd be surprised if I didn't spend a moment talking about that. Four of the leading independent companies that monitor Internet traffic; comScore, Compete.com, Experian, Hitwise, and Alexa, now show Apartments.com is the undisputed number one most heavily traffic in the apartment rentals listing space. According to comScore, in March 2015, we more than doubled year-over-year traffic to Apartments.com with 15 million visits and 7 million unique visitors. Our own internal Google Analytics numbers show even higher traffic numbers. But now Alexa, now shows us the most recent trailing pass-through day traffic numbers moving even higher with 9.1 million unique visitors to Apartments.com. That is nearly double Apartments Guide's five million unique visitors and quadruple for Rent's unique visitors of 1.9 million. These two major competitors each has significantly more revenue than Apartments.com does today and generally charged half price points and they charge significantly more for their lesser traffic than we do. We believe that advertisers will find it attractive to switch their lead generation budgets to our more heavily traffic Apartments.com and save money. It is really a nice sales visit when you go into a potential client, show them a superior product and save them money in their budget. We believe we can take significant share from these competitors. Alexa shows much more than just a traffic events for Apartments.com. According to Alexa, not only are more visitors coming to Apartments.com, but those that do stay, visit, stay approximately 50% longer in our site and they view more than twice as many pages on our site than any other competing apartment rental ILS site. Alexa measures bounce rate, which shown how many visits are low value because they immediately navigate away from the site after viewing just a page. An ILS, or an apartment website, wants to have the lowest bounce rate possible. Apartments.com has the lowest bounce rate in the apartment rentals listing space at one third lower than the rate of Apartments Guide or For Rent according to Alexa. Compete.com shows Apartments.com dominating the apartment rentals listing space with 60 million page views in the month of March 2015, which is twice the number for Apartment Guide and six times the number for, For Rent. In their monthly newsletter, Compete.com called out Apartments.com as one of the fastest -- 10 fastest upward momentum internet sites in the month of March other than March Madness. They also note our impressive growth and engagement stats as shown by pages per visit, length of visit and number of return visits. Experian not only shows us as the leading -- as leading other apartment rental listing sites and traffic, but they also show us capturing an amazing 51% of all of the SCO number-one slots for critical industry search terms such as apartments. Apartment Guide, in contrast, is only capturing 7.2% of those key terms and For Rent is only capturing 1.2% of them. Again 51% captured by Apartments.com have a key SCO term like apartments versus competitors with 7% or 1.2% capture in that number one slot, which matters. We're very proud of these very impressive across the Board results, but we view them as a great start and we're focused on continuing to wider our competitive lead. These impressive increases in traffic are creating massive exposure for our advertisers listings and it's difficult to give you a fairly representative picture of the true increase in quality lease we're generating for advertisers. Comparing leads from our old site to leads for our new site is like comparing apples and oranges. Our old site followed the industry standard and that we did not show apartments were actually available or not. So useless calls generated by renters to an apartment leasing office, only to find out that the one bedroom they're looking for is not available was counted as a lead. I don't think that makes any sense. Now on our site, renters can see -- can generally see the actual current availabilities on our site and the leads that go through are much more meaningful when they arrive in a leasing office because they're pretty qualified to some degree. Even if we do compare apples to oranges, we can see tremendous lead growth. Leads during the first quarter of 2015 are up nearly 67% year-over-year. We've received a lot positive feedback on results and I can share one I received just yesterday from Diane Callaghan, who manages Vista at Palma Sola apartments in Florida. She said, "We went live with Apartments.com on April 6. Since that day, our phones have not stopped ringing and we got 16 leases. To say the least, we're very happy with our decision to advertise our community on Apartments.com. Thank you for all that you do”. You're welcome Diane. In this quote, the customer is attributing the source of $192,000 of leasing to their roughly $500,000 ad on Apartments.com under traditional locator model, that have cost them 16,000. When you take all that into consideration, it's not surprising that we're having success selling. March was the first representative selling month post launch. March results exceed our highest sales expectations for the new site. At the end of the sales month, the Executive Team waits further results late that night. Last month as the results went out late at night around midnight, with our first ever eight digit annualized net new sales result, the Management Team replied with responses like, "OMG, wow, holy blank!" Net sales on Apartments.com in the first quarter of 2015 were up 827% compared to the first quarter of 2014. We had more net property additions in March 2015 than all of the preceding year. We had more net property additions in March 2015 than in all the preceding year. So in one month, we had more net sales during the entire prior year. I think I made that point. We cannot expect that pace to continue and certainly one month of sales does not make a meaningful trend, but it is a great result. We believe that many of the thousand plus apartment communities that signed up with us in March curtail their spending on competing sites. We do not know that -- we do know that that was the case with ApartmentFinder. After turning in reasonable growth for the past few years, their sales turned down as we launched our new site. ApartmentFinder was founded in 1979 and is one of the most recognizable brands in the multi-family internet listing service industry and has been a significant player across the United States. In the fiscal year ended March 2015, ApartmentFinder had revenue of approximately $79 million and EBITDA of approximately $23 million. Today ApartmentFinder reaches over 118 core markets in the multi-family space. ApartmentFinder's business model is very similar to the Apartments.com business with approximately 13,400 properties listed on its site. It combines website mobile apps and social media lead generation solutions with an optional digest sized local print publication. 80% of the leads they generate for advertisers are from ApartmentFinder.com and 20% are from their print product. It's main source of revenue is listings, which represent 91% of the ApartmentFinder revenue as of the fiscal year ended March 2015. Typical average monthly spend by client of ApartmentFinder is $482. They have an outstanding monthly renewal rate of 98%. We like the fact that their product is aggressively priced amongst industry competitors. Finder has two product lines that we do not currently offer in the apartment space. Finder Social is a content and social media marketing service for multi-family property customers and apartment communities. Finder's staff helps these clients create content manage online relationships. About 10% of Finder clients use Finder Social. It is sold as a high value ad on or standalone service. This has potentially greater value sold through our larger distribution channel. Finder has another product called Finder Sites, which is similar to our loop link product that we believe will be strategically valuable addition to our offerings. Finder Sites is a service offering that designs, develops and hosts websites for property management companies and apartment communities. They offer a responsive design, responsive design, full-service SCO package, unlimited site maintenance, dedicated personal consultants, and monthly website hosting. We began to acquire -- we began negotiating to acquire ApartmentFinder well over a year ago at approximately the same time we were engaged in the process to acquire Apartments.com. After intense negotiations last year, we were unable to reach agreement on a purchase at that level and both parties walked away more than six months ago. At the time several companies in Apartments Rental's ILS space were being offered in the 14 to 18 times EBITDA range. So people were trying to pick up 14-day 18 times EBITDA, once sold at 14 times, placing the valuation of that company at 1.5 billion. As we had previously communicated to investors, we were unwilling to purchase other ILS at the same EBITDA multiple that we paid to acquire Apartments.com. We passed on multiple potential deals. Using that multiple that was in play last year when we were unable to find the price we wanted, we would have been expected to pay over $300 million for Finder. A year ago, we wanted to focus our energies on successfully re-launching Apartments.com and reducing all those risks associated with that acquisition and the re-launch. Now that we have successfully launched Apartments.com, we've reduced so many risks in the business and developed new sales content, technology and brand asset that can be readily leveraged across other ILS sites. Within days of our national media blitz announcement and the new site launch, ApartmentFinder's owners contacted us and we resumed negotiations at a much lower price. A comment that was made was that they did want to show up at a gun fight with a knife. We're acquiring ApartmentFinder for $170 million in cash, which is much lower than the $300 million I mentioned earlier. This means we're buying the company approximately seven times EBITDA. This is less than half the multiple we paid for Apartments.com. The price that we paid is very roughly from where we were when we couldn’t come to agreement was $80 million less than the bottom price the seller had a year earlier and that difference incidentally is about what we spent on the incremental marketing campaign that helped us to achieve this lower price and so many other clear additional benefits. We're not planning to do an immense branding campaign for ApartmentFinder as we did with Jeff Goldblum for Apartments.com. Probably two analysts want me to say it again. We're not planning to do an immense branding campaign for ApartmentFinder as we did with Jeff Goldblum for Apartments.com. That would be the first question. We're focusing on online marketing for ApartmentFinder. However, there is no doubt that the advertising and brand work we're doing for Apartments.com will benefit ApartmentFinder because it will give our sales people who sell both services access to buyers because of the power of an unprecedented Apartments.com campaign. So it gives us access across all of our product lines. We expect to achieve a run rate of $20 million of synergies over the next 18 months, which could effectively lower the multiple paid to somewhere around four times EBITDA. We believe that we can achieve these synergies, while at the same time dramatically increasing our investment in digital marketing for Finder to drive significant traffic to the site. We're in Atlanta for the days cost so that we can get to work right away on our plans to integrate Finder once the transaction is closed in order to leverage all of our new and valuable assets. Our technical leadership is already meeting with their team to begin integration planning as we did with Apartments.com. We already had preliminary design specs done for the ApartmentFinder site by the time we announced the deal yesterday. We plan to consolidate all of Finder's content, billing and CRM into our new backend that we built to drive Apartments.com. That means that once this effort is complete, we will have one cost for collecting amazing content, great billing systems in CRM that's leveraged for two brands. Equally importantly, we expect Finder will gain huge new strengths and competitive advantage in content while gaining this better billing and CRM system and much larger sales force. ApartmentFinder offers it's advertisers a print directory option that is relatively ineffective in driving lease and is expensive to produce and often tougher in organization to come to grips with and eliminate. We plan to eliminate the print offering as soon as possible. Print and distribution spend is $12 million and operating expenses for approximately $800,000 print publications a month, distributed through an extensive rack distribution network. Over time, we plan to shift the money ApartmentFinder has been spending in print publications to a larger investment in search engine marketing programs to deliver more leads online where most search activity is actually taking place. We believe that we can replace more than the print leads lost with additional online traffic generated on a new finder site with this larger SEM budget. Apartments.com and ApartmentFinder eventually are powered by the same data basis. So we believe that we can also replace any leads lost from finder print with silver level ads in Apartments.com. We hope to phase out print in less than a year. While we're phasing out of print, we expect to run both the print cost and the enhanced SEM cost. We're doing that because we feel that time is of the essence and we want to be aggressively growing all of our brands. We plan to continue to operate Apartments.com and ApartmentFinder as two separate and distinct brands, each with their own distinctively different website experiences and user interfaces. Our goal is that renters will view the brands as very different sites targeting different audiences. The different looking to the renter, the sites will leverage much of the same technology under the hood and the content will be very similar that we just build for Apartments.com. So we have two very competitive sites for half the unleveraged cost. It is obviously valuable to have multiple leverage consumer brands in the apartment rental website space. No matter how successful we are, you will never Google the search term apartments for rent and get a Google result page with Apartments.com as the only result with a great big white space below us. Wish it was true, it's not. It's much better to compete with ourselves as the alternative choice than with a third party because Google, Bing or Yahoo users can retain multiple brands and their recall we want to also occupy multiple considerations in their top of mind to capture a larger share of direct traffic as well. Our research shows that renters typically visit three to six sites in their apartment search. We want to engage them in as many of these sites as we can. In much the same way, Priceline is a highly profitable, $65 billion market cap company that wisely operates multiple complementary brands in travel including Booking.com, Kayak, RentalCars.com, Agoda, and OpenTable. Expedia is another highly successful multi-billion company and it operates brands like Expedia, Hotels.com, Trivago, Hotwire, Travelocity, Car Rentals, Venere, and eLong. It's all about the real estate in the online world. Who shows up at the top of search results or top of mind can generate high margin, big revenue and that's why and it's why we've consistently operated from this strategy for a long time. When a searcher enters a term like office space for sale in San Diego into Google, the results are awful -- often, not awful, but great. Now the results are often multiple CoStar Group brands such as LoopNet, Showcase, CityFeet and CoStar, and sometimes brokerage firm sites that are powered by our loop link product. This way when the searcher goes in there, we're not losing business to competitors and holding other slots on the page or not losing as much business. This is also the strategy that we're consistently using for our two brands in the land space and for our two brands in the business for sale space. Generating online leads for their apartment community is a mission critical utility for an owner. They often want to market their property on multiple sites to diversify and generate more leads than they can get from one site. Again remember that the ad spend online in this space is estimated at $1.5 billion in 2015. We're only a getting piece today and meeting customer and demand is a good way to grow a share. In focus groups owners have told us that they would really like it if they could deal with just one sales representative and deal once with setting up online feeds and updating sites, working with just one company, but in doing this, they want to also be able to high their goal of moving out to multiple sites. We plan to do that. So with this acquisition, we gain a 120 valuable new apartment sales professionals. This team will join our existing 500 plus sales professionals giving us one of the largest sales forces in the industry. Eventually one sales person will serve multiple sites for a given owner, streamline the process for the client, while reducing our cost per sale at the same time. We had a very positive meeting with the ApartmentFinder team here in Atlanta yesterday after the deal was announced. We're thrilled with all the new talent joining us in our effort to build the premier apartment network. We look forward to working with them for many years to come and accomplishing great things together. We've had tremendous success transforming Apartments.com into an industry leader in a very short period of time and I am looking forward to repeating that success with ApartmentFinder. We have an exceptional head start since much of the infrastructure we've built for Apartments.com is directly relevant and can be use for ApartmentFinder; acquire, beat and repeat. I'll wind up with a quick update on our international operations. The sales efforts in the U.K. continue to deliver great results as we achieve the highest ever net sales month in March 2015 and the annualized new sales of £301,000. We're closing in our 1,000th customer for CoStar suite in the U.K. Our sales are accelerating with more than one new subscriber firm on average every day since the launch of the CoStar suite product in the U.K. We're now advancing our plans to retire the older focused product completely from the market and expect to complete that before mid 2016. I am very pleased that we've achieved -- what we've achieved in the first quarter of 2015 overall. We've unleashed the powerful new sales platform that is driving record sales of CoStar and Apartments.com. We're confident we're the only company that can really deliver its property managers and owners a marketing solution along with a comprehensive information analytics platform for an exceptional price. We think that ApartmentFinder will be a very valuable and profitable asset that will strengthen our service offering. I believe in our way to $1 billion in revenue and 40% margins in 2018 and that we're exceptionally positioned for strong growth and financial success for many years to come. At this point, I will reluctantly turn the call over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer.
Brian Radecki: Yeah, that wasn’t for two conference calls in one Andy. I was expecting to go a little longer both the quarter and on acquisitions. Thank you, Andy. I know. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2015, the investments we're making in marketing are showing positive early results with all-time high sales numbers, increased traffic and leads. All the while CoStar Group's core business continues to show solid topline growth. While we're in the early stages of the Apartments.com website re-launch and national marketing campaign, the early uplift in sales and traffic support our view that apartment's revenue will accelerate in the third and fourth quarter this year and obviously beyond. We expect the acquisition of ApartmentFinder will help expand our market share with property owners as well as our reach with consumers, while generating sizeable crop selling opportunities in synergies in 2016. The ApartmentFinder transaction we announced yesterday when we paid for with cash on hand of about $170 million, which is as Andy mentioned a very favorable evaluation at seven times EBITDA. We expect the deal to close in the 90 days or less. The valuation looks even better when you consider the $20 million in run rate synergies we expect to achieve within 18 months after the close. Given the attractive purchase price and the benefits that come along with that, we can drive significant value for shareholders. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, revenue for the total ApartmentFinder business is approximately $75 million with EBITDA at approximately $23 million resulting in a 29% margin. However, there are several non-core assets, which we will likely sell and discontinue over the next 18 months. Example, rack space rentals in grocery stores, banner ads and other selectable items. ApartmentFinder's core advertising revenue was approximately $68 million to $70 million for 2015. The ApartmentFinder business as Andy mentioned grew in the low single digits last year and was down slightly last quarter. We believe a refresh of the ApartmentFinder website with increased SEM initiatives will enhance the business and contribute revenue and EBITDA to CoStar in 2016. We expect to realize the longer term cost synergies by running two distinct branded sites using the same IT infrastructure, same data collection research for both Apartment.com and ApartmentFinder. Just as we've done with Apartment.com and LoopNet, we expect to leverage the technology, research, marketing and sales with the ApartmentFinder business, which will translate to significant revenue and EBITDA to CoStar. Turning your attention back to CoStar's results for the first quarter of 2015, the company reported $159 million of revenue, an increase of 33.5% compared to the first quarter of 2014. As previously discussed, the company made significant marketing investments in the first quarter for Apartment.com, therefore adjusted EBITDA was $23.8 million, non-GAAP net income was $10.8 million or $0.34 per diluted share and net income was a loss of $6.1 million. Strong gross margins of $113.6 million for the quarter or at 71.5% of revenue is similar to the gross margins reported in Q1 of last year, even though it includes the investments in research for multi-family in Canada, we've discussed the prior two quarters. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call for their GAAP basis results along with definitions of those terms in our press release issued yesterday are available on our website at www.costar.com and if you have any questions. just hit, Get Rich at CoStargroup.com. Cash and investments increased to $558.4 million as of March 31, 2015, up $14.2 million from last quarter. Cash and investments exceeded total short and long-term debt of $380 million as of March 31. Now I would like to give some additional color on a few metrics to highlight our strong performance in the quarter. As Andy mentioned, we achieved $16.2 million in annualized net new sales of subscription services on annual contracts in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of 10.3% over the first quarter of 2014. This has been the consistent metric we've been providing for quarters. Our annualized net bookings in the first quarter climbed to over $20 million, an increase of 50% over the same period last year. This is our best quarter ever of net bookings by a mile. This metric picks up all the six month apartment contracts that are not included in the annual metric. Obviously viewed in conjunction with the annualized net new sales of subscription service metric, these are good indicators of future revenue growth. As of March 31, 2015, we had approximately 504 sales people across the country, which is consistent with prior quarter and obviously does not include the additional sales people we will pick up with ApartmentFinder. Revenue from subscription services and annual contracts was up $106.5 million for the first quarter or 66.9% of total revenue. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2015, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $404.7 million, up 18.2% from the 12-months ended March 31, 2014, reflecting our continued success in growing annual subscriptions faster the non-subscription pieces of the business. The year-over-year growth in annual subscription revenue has remained in the 18% to 20% range for the past six quarters, which is important to remember. We expect to continue to grow revenue from subscription on annual contracts back up into the 70s in the near term and eventually through the 80% and 90% of our total revenue, which continues to be a focus across the company. Renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained high during the quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar subscription base revenue was 91.3% in the first quarter of 2015, which is fairly consistent with last quarter's 91.5%. As we've discussed for the last few quarters, the introduction of more annual Loopnet contracts ensuing apartments and ApartmentFinder, into the subscription base is expected to cause the 12-month renewal rate to edge down slightly, possibly a 1% or 2%. Therefore, we continue to expect to be in the 90% to 91% range. But remember, the renewal rate for CoStar subscribers who've been with us for five years or longer, continues to remain high at 98%, it's actually 98.4%, that we're so close to getting back up to 99%, I can't wait. One additional item we expect to impact our renewal rate in future quarters is GE's announcement to sell its real estate portfolio. GE is a long-time subscriber of CoStar and CoStar portfolio of strategy. So this transaction could have a short term impact on our reported renewal rates reducing the annual size of the renewal rate of approximately half to one percentage points. We believe our revenue guidance range adequately accounts for the uncertainty related to this customer. I'll now discuss out outlook for the second quarter and full year 2015, is that okay, double check it. We expect revenue of approximately $688 million to $698 million, based on our strong first quarter 2015 sales results we're raising the full year 2015 guidance for the core business by $3 million on both the top and bottom end of the range. We expect revenue trends to continue to improve in Q3 and Q4 of 2015. Additionally, we've incorporated ApartmentFinder into our annual outlook range by adding an additional $30 million to $35 million. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect revenue of approximately $162 million to $163.5 million. This includes previously disclosed de-emphasizing services, changing over the new Apartments.com website and does not include any revenue from ApartmentFinder for Q2. We expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $1.98 to $2.08 for the full year of 2015 and approximately $0.10 to $0.14 for the second quarter. This outlook assumes minimal impact on non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the ApartmentFinder acquisition. For the remainder of 2015, investments in the ApartmentFinder website and increased search engine marketing are expected to approximately offset their earnings to pick up. As we mentioned earlier, we expect the ApartmentFinder acquisition to be significantly accretive in 2016 and beyond as we integrate the websites and utilize one back end and one information. Compared to our first quarter 2015 outlook, a large portion of our Q1 favorability in earnings is related to the timing of the marketing investment approximately $5 million in costs shifted from the first quarter to the second quarter, while total cost -- total incremental cost of the marketing campaign remains at the $75 million. We still expect the media spend to peak in the second quarter of 2015 to coincide with the prime season for apartment renters. I should here that we just signed the ApartmentFinder acquisition on Monday. We will obviously be doing a lot more work in our integration plans and our forecast. So we look forward to updating investors on those plans and the impact and our outlook next quarter. In summary, I am very pleased with CoStar's financial results for the first quarter and we're off to a great start with Apartments.com traffic and sales. I look forward to reporting our continued progress in the coming quarters. As a reminder we achieved a 35% adjusted EBITDA margin in Q4 of 2014 before launching the Apartments.com campaign with the potential synergies available with the ApartmentFinder deal this allows us to continue to remain even more confident in our prior stated goal of a $1 billion of revenue with 40% plus adjusted EBITDA margins exiting 2018. Now as our confidence growth and 2018 gets closer, we look into the future. What was the tag line? Therefore we're going to establish a new longer term range goal for 2020 or a 20-20 vision if you will. I can see the vision of $1.5 billion in revenue run rate with a 45% to 50% adjusted EBITDA margins. So $1.5 million in revenue with 45% to 50% adjusted EBITDA margins. Everybody get that? So we're not going to adjust the 2018 goal. We're obviously confident in that, but we're going to set a new five-year goal. As always I look forward to sharing our progress towards these goals with you in the coming quarter and now we'll open up the call to any questions.
Operator: Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yeah thanks guys. I appreciate it. In terms of the ApartmentFinder acquisition, when you look at the two properties, I understand the marketing delineation that you're trying to drive for. But how do you not end up cannibalizing your higher monthly charged property with the lower?
Andy Florance: Are you referring to the fact that -- are you referring to the free ads versus the paid ads, or are you referring to a price differential between ApartmentFinder and Apartments.com?
Sterling Auty: Mainly the price differential, because aren't you going to end up with free content on both?
Andy Florance: We will and we're very pleased with what we've seen in the site behavior and differential between the significant exposure, the premium content gains versus the relatively insignificant exposure the free content gets. So the paid is getting really good traffic comparatively. So we're actually very comfortable with that and we really like the numbers, the very consistent. So we're not really concerned about the cannibalization, but it is very important to the renter that they find their complete content, they're always searching for that diamond in the rough and we believe they prefer a more comprehensive organized site. So that draws additional traffic and then you're getting this differentiated or this funnel that drives more of the additional traffic to the premium listing. So we feel good about that. The Finder price point is actually higher than the Apartments.com average price point. So we're -- but relatively similar compared to other solutions out there. So, so many other solutions are charging maybe any range of 40% to 80% more on average than we are. So we're able to do high margin sales along with information sales at a lower price point than some of these other players and we like being in that situation. The superior product a profitable lower price. So we like that lower price and we're not worried about a sort of cannibalization there. does that answer the question and I am glad there was a question, or there would be no question today?
Operator: And next, we will go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington: I wasn't sure if I should be asking about a tax rate in 2020. That's probably the top question. So first of all, congratulations on the deal, very impressive, and the performance as well in the quarter. With one question, I'm going to ask about the new metric. You've given the new net subscription sales historically. You're giving the net bookings now. The $4.8 million difference between the $16.2 million and a $21.0 million, is that all Apartments? Or does that include anything else in there that would be short term?
Andy Florance: It includes anything else in their build obviously with the strong performance in apartments in March the biggest piece of it is apartments. So that does include everything else. I think it's a metric we used to talk about years ago. Obviously the company really focuses on annual contracts. We're trying to move LoopNet's annual contracts and when we first look at the apartment space, we were told that people won't sell annual contracts as of course lots of people are now. So I think we will continue to push people up to the annual contracts which obviously has so many benefits, but it sort of includes an all in number and I've always said this. I don't think you look at any one metric, but I think when you look at the metrics combined, it obviously gives you trends right and it gives you trends that the future looks bright for revenue growth for CoStar.
Bill Warmington: And that monthly bookings number that you had there? How do we look at that in that context?
Andy Florance: Well obviously it's by far a mile the highest number we've ever seen. So what that says is as revenues, as that continues to go higher, you're going to obviously translate in Q3, Q4 and into the next year with higher revenue growth, which is sort of what we said. We said, listen the first half of this year was going to be about getting the site converted, launching the marketing programs and obviously having such success gives us even more confidence in the back half of the year, which is why raised up, it didn't really raise up Q2 that much a little bit, but really it's more about the back half of this year and obviously going in the next year. And if you look at -- so the industry we came into was 30-day industry and it doesn’t make sense because these folks who own these 300 unit communities their need to generate leads and traffic in their leasing office does not go away at the end of 30 days. So we're giving them a compelling reasons to do a moderate commitment of one year and part of that successful formula is giving them a fantastic information solution CoStar market analytics, which allows them to now take those leads that we're giving them and then optimize the pricing using our system or help them to supervise the yield management system using our really detailed granular competitive pricing information. So people are responding really well to that and we're getting great traction and two things are happening that was considered -- two things were happening in the industry that were considered not possible before. One is people are, a lot of people are going to annual contracts, which rarely happened before and secondly, historically people moved one or two properties at a time between ILS. We're now seeing a regular occurrence of people moving a significant percentage of their portfolio from one ILS over to us and that's because we're giving them a good solid deal for buying both -- doing bulk purchase doing an annual contract and including information purchase. So this doesn’t mean we want to turn our back on a lot of revenue that is ready to beyond six months and part of that is just it depends which person our sales force went and with them. As prior some of our sales people getting a 100% annual business now and some have spent five or six years doing 30-day and six months of that contract. So the more meaningful number to me is that booking number right now.
Operator: And next, we will go to Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin: Thanks. Good morning.
Andy Florance: Good morning.
Andre Benjamin: I know you guys just signed the deal and have some work to do, but I wanted to dig a little bit more into how the sites will actually differ beyond just giving you the ability to fill the first page of Google results, which does have some value. Maybe a little more detail on how the interfaces will be different, differences in the branding. And what is the difference in the typical customer you hope to target or the property manager that would list on one site versus the other?
Andy Florance: Good question and I appreciate your prefacing it with the fact that we're one business hour into the announcement. So having said that, it's pretty the folks in the United States have $100 million ranchers in the United States, it's a very diverse group and what drives, who those people are and what drives them is very different. So if I take -- if I take that 18 to 27 demographic and I do quartiles on up to 70 years old, you've got big audiences in each of those sectors. Obviously those audiences are looking at the world, their apartment rent in very different ways and you also have -- you have people who are moving -- 15% of the world is moving in the rental because they've been relocated to a new location. 50% is moving because of financial drivers. They're either trying to avoid a rent increase. They're trying to reduce their spend on rent. They've had an income adjustment. They're trying to get a large apartment for the same price. So 50% are very price sensitive. So there is a rich a variety of options on how you actually target a site of different audiences and different needs of these very different audiences. We've done a ton research into who these people are. We've literally interviewed 10,000 renters. We've done focus groups with hundreds and hundreds of renters in cities and all over the United States. We've also done segmented focus groups looking at these different age groups. Now we've got at least six Zulia employees on the call today, so I'm not going to go into too much detail, but we've done really innovative things in the design like use the color orange instead of the color green for the new design. We did tricky things like move the placards from the right of the map to the left of the back and I have to tell you, working with designers who have worked on the first site it takes a lot of discipline to make sure that the site really develops an honest, unique personality. People keep trying to use things from the prior design. So ultimately when we're all said and done, we will have independent product management teams with mission statements as to what their product philosophy is and they’ll maintain these unique UIs and there will be content on one side that does not exist on the other side. So we'll make it genuine, we'll make a genuine difference renter experience in these sites to cater to these very different marketplaces. Initially the finder feels like it could be a great opportunity to focus on those people who are driven primarily by economics in their decision. So we might be exploring that, but we will show you more hopefully pretty soon with the launch.
Brian Radecki: And just to add to that is that the ApartmentFinder have been around and founded in 1979 as Andy said and it probably somewhat focuses on some of the smaller geographies. So it has its own sort of core following it and following it for a long, long time. So I think that obviously will also continue to drive it ahead as its own unique sort of offering. It has lots of people obviously that have been going to it for many, many years.
Operator: And next, we will go to the line Michael Huang with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Michael Huang: Thanks. Good morning. Congrats guys.
Andy Florance: Good morning. Thank you.
Michael Huang: Just a quick question for you. So for your advertisers that you're acquiring for Apartments.com, I was wondering, do you have a general sense for what percentage of their advertising budget that you're capturing? How much more room is there to grow as these customers -- and do you actually believe that ApartmentFinder helps to deepen penetration, or is that more to help acquire new customers?
Andy Florance: So without a doubt there is an awful long ways to go these folks. So as we go into Apartments.com, we never were going into a meeting with one of these prospects. We tried to understand -- we tried to actually, we required that the sales people really give us a solid estimate of what they're spending on all the other sites out there, what their market budget looks like. And we're generally a pretty small percentage of their overall marketing budget. So we set goals for what sort of share of their marketing budget we want to get and we're absolutely at the very beginning of that process. Now I am struck by the fact that when you look at these different owners and their advertising plans, they're almost always running on multiple sites. So that's important to them and you cannot get to these people and say, no don't advertise, like don't advertise on the other site. They feel the need to have diversity and diversification across their plan especially when they're in a lease-up situation with new construction, which is very common right now. They like to hit multiple runs. So Finder allows us to go in there and I've been on some meetings where -- I've been on some meetings where I will see that we have about 10% of their budget and then another site has got 20%, another site has got 40%, another site has got 10%, another site has got 5%. This allows us to go in there and do a fairly big deal where we take up additional 15% of their marketing budget by virtue of having two different viable solid well recognized brands that they can market on. So this allows us to go for bigger hits. Now size of deals we're pulling in right now are the upper quartile of these are probably 4X or 5X anything in Apartments.com has ever seen before and the addition of Finder allows those deals to be even bigger again once we've done the technology and pulled the offerings together. So did that answer your question? Or do you want to refine that question? Or did you get moved into the next call. Okay, we'll circle if you want to get more on that.
Operator: And we will now go to the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Sara Gubins: Hi, thank you. I'm hoping you could give us an update on core CoStar sales to institutional investor clients. And also, on the LoopNet price increases, any update on how that's going? I know that you've talked about a $10 million to $15 million revenue headwind for the year that's in guidance. But I'm wondering if there are any signs that you're actually losing to clients to a point that might support that headwind. Thank you.
Andy Florance: I'll start with LoopNet and then turn it over to Andy to talk about debt and equity. So we expect the impact of the LoopNet to continue to be in the range of sort of what we had. Our strategy has somewhat evolved as we've opted to raise pricing of LoopNet information services fairly dramatically. So it reduces competition with sort of the CoStar services instead of sitting down the channel in the short term. As planned sort of subscribers are declining, you're not picking as many of them up and they're declining. We'll obviously continue to evaluate that strategy. As LoopNet faced declines, we expect obviously over the next few quarters assign many of those up to higher value CoStar contracts, but we'll be continuing to monitor that and tweak that. How we go about it might evolve, but essentially sort of the strategy what we have we believe is working.
Brian Radecki: And to answer your other question about our debt and equity sales and the core CoStar and what that looks like right now, I was looking at the list of sales people who would be able to attend one of the big industry conference in June two days ago and I did notice that the regular names or the regular suspects in our sales force who sell debt and equity outside of the traditional, this new Apartment.com sell debt and equity information. Those folks were looking really solid and were turning in some really good numbers. So I don't have detail on that, but I just see those guys, those folks producing good solid numbers and that would not be -- that would not likely be the sort of combined info apartment cross-sell numbers. So those do qualify as institutional debt and equity sales or debt and equity sales.  Without disclosing some specific names, we had a -- we had one very big win, half million competitive win taking away from another player in the debt and equity space this month. So we're very thrilled with and we think it is a strategic win that could allow us to get additional new wins across that space. So that's going well, but one of our problems here, one of our problems, great problem, one of our problems here is that the sales force is watching what's going on and they're seeing people get some very big ticket sales on this combined Apartment.com CoStar market analytic sale to the multi-family world and now there is a line mile long of sales people going after that space and they're all and in fact we've had to rely on our new commission structure to keep people focused on LoopNet. So our new commission structure I think we've mentioned in the past, your percentage commission rates are set by how much you filled up the three core buckets of CoStar apartments and LoopNet. So that's the only thing keeping sales people focused on some of the traditional things when they're seeing these big numbers in the apartment space.
Operator: Okay. And next we'll go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi guys. Good afternoon.
Andy Florance: Hi Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: A question for you, Brian, on the Apartments.com revenue contribution this quarter. Just trying to back into organic revenue growth, and then what your expectations will be, given these strong bookings numbers for organic revenue growth in the back half and maybe what you think the sustainable rate of underlying revenue growth can be, looking out.
Brian Radecki: Sure, yes, I think sort of pro forma I don't have the exact number around, but I think it's around 13% sort of pro forma. Obviously we switched over the site. There is some revenue that falls off. The site got switched over basically at the end of February. So sort of one month worth and then obviously that will roll through the second quarter. So we feel pretty good. Core business continues to grow in that 12%, 13%, 14% range and once we get through the switch over and some of the things that we talked about, we think obviously these bookings are just a great sign for what we believe can happen in Q3, Q4 and obviously go into 2016. So the stated goals out there is that we will sort of in the back half of this year start to grow the apartments business into sort of the high teens and as you go into next year getting the 20% plus and yeah I think it's the sustainable. I think that when you have a current estimated $1.5 billion space that I believe is going to be $2 billion to $3 billion as more and more advertising dollars go offline, I believe we can run that piece of the business at 20% plus for many, many, many years to come. So obviously looking into my crustal ball, I am not going to -- a lot of people ask me and one of the reasons why I put out my 20-20 vision so to speak is that while I am not going to change 2018, but the revenue number obviously becomes very achievable with where we are today, with the acquisition. Obviously we're also committed to the EBITDA line, which is I think important to a lot of people, but the 20-20 vision tells you that when you look at the combined business, we can continue to grow in the 14%, 15% sort of percentage points for a long, long time to come. So we're pretty confident we have a huge opportunity here that we can execute on over the next five years.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Peter Lowry with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Peter Lowry: Hi. Congratulations on a great quarter. Obviously, the marketing campaign has been very successful so far. Can you talk about how you address concerns that marketing spend may stay elevated after the campaign ends?
Andy Florance: Well at this point it has been very successful has driven a lot of traffic. It has differentiated our brand and the space and it's allowing us to take a lot of share and set record sales numbers. It's obviously really early in the process though. We only one month of sales. So we're not at this point setting our 2016 budget or strategy, or plan, but remember that one of the things we're doing here is we definitely I think the world has changed and that similar to the travel world, the apartment world will be a world which people will make investments in branding to consumers. It is a massive, massive marketplace and will remain so. So I think this is the new reality to some degree. Now it take a lot more money to build a brand than to maintain a brand and we've tried various weeks where we pulled back on the campaign or it's just part of our preset plan was to have certain regulatory pull back on the campaign and just watched traffic as that happened. And we're pretty happy with the way site performance remained up despite the fact that we pulled back in certain week to test, but it's so early and one of the things we're conscious of as we look at an acquisition of a finder is that it gives us additional scale high margin scale so that you can actually maintain a significant B2C in some component of your formula and leverage that across a broader revenue stream. So it's very early, but nothing has changed from our earlier feeling that our overall branding component of our campaign would moderate in 2016.
Brian Radecki: And I think just to add to that, we talked last quarter and the quarter before about our goal was to have $500 million plus in the space over the coming years at a 50% margin and so I think that that remains and that's really when you look at -- when you look out at the 20-20 vision where we believe the business will be. So really what you're doing is you're going to have -- you're still going to have marketing dollars going, but you're obviously spreading those dollars over a much bigger revenue base and with higher revenue growth obviously you can in the future, you'll be able to spend appropriately on the marketing, but you'll obviously have the earnings that people are looking for. And if you look at other industries that is exactly when you look at like a Priceline or other companies, Expedia, they're growing, they have EBITDA margins in the 40%, 50% range. So we feel pretty confident in the long-term vision of the company and the profitability that it can hold. The other thing to sort of point out is that in the launch of this campaign, it's very aspirational or very visionary. You don't have an immediate near term ROI calculation because it's all theoretical. As you move into 2016, you actually can begin to move into a more calculated ROI for each specific investment and then each year it goes by, you'll be able to calculate that specific ROI more and more cleanly. So we'll be able to give more clarity as to what and why and how.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff: Good morning, Andy, Brian and Rich.
Andy Florance: Good morning.
Brett Huff: I need to follow up on -- a question was asked before on the $10 million to $15 million of the fund-setting of the Loop rev this year. Brian, I think you answered that question. What I'm trying to get at is the sales, or the net new bookings of annual contracts on subscriptions was up 10%, all in. The info was up 20%, and it implies LoopNet was down. The question is, how much of that $10 million to $15 million, and I know that's a revenue number, but how much of that fund-setting is negatively impacting that net new number on the Loop side? And have we burned our way through the $10 million to $15 million and we're now moving on, or how does that look? Will the net new for Loop get better through the year, I guess is my question.
Brian Radecki: Yes, obviously I think the LoopNet will get better. I think the majority if you look at the stuff when you raise the price as dramatically as we did, we are losing subscribes, the premium searcher and most of those are monthly. So that's actually being picked up in this bookings number, the $20 million bookings number. So as we lose those subscribers that will be picked up in that number and obviously as we pick up, and that now eliminates sort of the -- or we believe it really reduces the competition with the core CoStar service. As we think go out and sell those clients over the next few quarters, yes. I believe that will contribute to the LoopNet annual number getting better and better. So I think essentially instead of shutting it down, we're obviously sort of spreading it out. We're doing it a different way with increasing the price on the LoopNet info stuff, but I think overall, you end up with a very similar impact on the revenue number for the year. So obviously we monitor that and we can sort of pull the levers on that. So we're feeling good with where we're at.
Brett Huff: Okay. Thank you.
Brian Radecki: Thanks.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Phil Stiller with Citi. Please go ahead.
Phil Stiller: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to get a little more detail on the ApartmentFinder assumptions. So you gave the revenue and EBITDA numbers and then the synergy numbers. I'm just trying to understand, I guess, what the EBITDA impact is of getting rid of some of their legacy products. And then what is assumed in the $20 million synergy rate? Is that a straight expense synergy number, or does that assume any benefit from some of the cross-sales that Andy was talking about earlier? Thanks.
Brian Radecki: Yeah I think it's combined. So we talked pretty in detail about this. When we pick them up, we're obviously going to move fairly quickly on the search engine marketing side by increasing that before you can get to a lot of the expenses. So we obviously are going to rebuild the site with a goal by the end of the year and you will then look to transition over to one platform which then gives you the synergies. I think Andy mentioned the $12 million number on the print publications and those types of things that will look to obviously aggressively move out of. You can't move out of that till you get to the new site. So you're going to immediately start moving and spending on the digital side and you'll get the benefits of the synergies as you move to the new platform, which really should happen in 2016. So yes, I think you're going to get to $20 million of synergies, which is going to include and will include some cross-selling of the two. Obviously they have a ton of clients. We don't have and vice versa and you can go back to those clients and obviously offer both services at a great price and a price that's lower than the competitors prices out there. So I think 2016 will look great from that standpoint.
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Brandon Dobell with William Blair.. Please go ahead.
Brandon Dobell: I just want to leverage that last question for a second. The synergies versus the, I guess the site refresh, and I want to anticipate a marketing campaign once you get Finder organized like you want it to get, how do you think about the offset there? Are you going to save money to spend money? Should we expect the timing on those things to be not synchronized? I want to make sure I just understand the puts and takes as you move into owning it.
Andy Florance: Sure, so there are multiple different kinds of marketing specific to the Finder site. So one would be SEM spend basically, basic search engine marketing. That's a very efficient way to acquire leads and actually measure the specific cost of leads that also has the benefit of competing with other players for the same lead. So that is a very measureable ROI activity and we would immediately become more aggressive in that space, which is an investment that we won't give the specific number, but it's -- it would be something that would probably offset the print investment area, which is not insignificant selling a 800,000 copies to 119 cities is large. So they offset each other pretty closely. So direct SEM and similar kind of digital acquisition of leads. We do not envision -- we do not envision there being a huge any kind of materially huge branding activity with occurring around Finder. A site can live on the internet without that kind of branding. And at this point we don't see it. That could change at some point in the future, but we will be able to clearly announce why. And then you're going to have -- we ran through a whole bunch of -- so you have an offset there between the print and the digital marketing and then you have a whole range of other efficiencies that are coming in the business here, like it is expensive and difficult to pull content from your advertisers, keep it up to date, keep the high quality there. And virtually all of the content that Finder currently spends a lot of time and money managing and pulling, we already since we're full inventory we already are pulling that content and we already bear that cost. So once you come together you have a duplicative cost there for content, that goes away and you end up with because you have more sites being populated by the same effort you have and more motivated list giving you direct access to the accounting systems and their property management systems. So that's just one example of where you're getting cost savings. So we see this over time, we're not talking about any kind of mass layoff here, any near-term way, but there is just across the Board your technology, your content, your customer service, your billing, everything, you got all sorts of leverage against your cost. So I believe that ApartmentFinder will become a very profitable site in a remarkably quick period of time and that the cost savings will come in the form of attrition and the like that is natural with any business. So if you look at -- if you look at LoopNet we obviously achieved massive cost synergies and I think we laid off four people. So I think we have a similar scenario here and I am very excited about the potential margin of ApartmentFinder. It is significant.
Operator: And we will have a follow-up from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Sterling Auty: Yes thanks hi guys. Can you give us an update on where you are in the projects and investment? You mentioned London, but how about with all the efforts that you laid out for Canada?
Andy Florance: Canada, well to be honest with you February was not an attractive time to be focusing. No offence to my sister or brother out there, but the -- no, that's progressing well. I understand that they're having a decent sales month up there at this point and that we're bringing online Calgary, Vancouver, I think Ottawa's a little bit farther behind on that and we're actually cycling up research in Montreal at this point. So I walked in on a research meeting the other day with six -- en France -- six researchers parlaying. And so I think it's going well. And was there anything second part to the…
Sterling Auty: No, that was it. Thank you.
Andy Florance: Okay.
Operator: And next we'll go to a follow-up from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin: Thanks for the additional question. So despite the valuation and the strategy that you've laid out, some investors that we've spoken with are still focused on the fact that this is somewhat of a reversal from prior statements that you didn't intend to be a consolidator of apartment sites. So I guess I just wanted to clarify, do you intend to use the rest of the cash to make more acquisitions, for one; and two, should we expect those to be other apartment sites or other types of assets?
Andy Florance: Well first of all, okay right. So first of all I do want to clarify that we were I think pretty clear in saying that we passed on and in specific reference to the marketing investment we made in Mr. Jeff Goldblum, which has been very successful, we felt that we were looking at a set of options which were either they acquire other ILS at valuations similar to Apartment.com acquisition or the Provident Equity acquisition of a share of Apartment Guide. And we just -- we looked at the ROI that we saw with branding and share gain there versus acquiring folks at 14 times EBITDA and we felt there is simply no question. There is we feel that it's obvious -- it's an obvious choice when you can great share, gain momentum, get scale, get cost efficiencies acquiring folks at somewhere in the four to seven EBITDA range and we would entertain additional opportunities that were highly accretive. In that range we felt that they fell within our operational capabilities and that they would be really good values. It's a situation here where we picked up Apartment.com here we had less than 7% share of the online spend of apartment -- of the apartment industry. That was not the trump card. No analyst had a pulling a $1 billion of revenue in 2016 for the apartment space. So we want to get a major share here and picking up very cost effective scale in 6% increment of the spend or 5% increment spend could be attractive and each time you do that, we think it's a prisoner's dilemma for remaining players where their value goes down faster based upon scale growing in other spaces. So I would encourage those investors to keep an open mind as we perform on this and remember that there was a lot of skepticism around our acquisition of LoopNet. A lot of people said, hey you're making tremendous progress with your online marketplace. Don't acquire LoopNet. You're capturing share for them, but we feel very good about our decision to acquire LoopNet. It was obviously the much higher multiple than ApartmentFinder and obviously was much more consolidation, but the folks that are a little skeptical about these things at the time they happen often don't circle back and say, oh you were right, but we would ask people to give us a little bit of room on this one because we feel pretty confident that this is straightforward.
Brian Radecki: And just to add to that, just to remind everybody what actually happened, when we did Apartments, I think we discussed that there were more deals out there that we had ever seen and that we were looking at other deals. I think that was pretty clear and communicated to investors. I think we came back to investors after looking at the price points that people wanted and said no, we don't want to do that and by the way, we want to focus as Andy mentioned on sort of getting Apartment.com and building that platform now and getting to a success. So I think now coming being able to now pick up other assets with having complementary brands like the Expedia, like the Pricelines, now at a good price point, specifically when all the risks are behind you and now you can have the significant synergies both on the cost side and revenue side, I think it makes a ton of sense. Now of course we will focus down on integrating this platform also and in the future we will again evaluate where we are. But I saw that posted out there that people that we made changes in our strategy. I think you actually go back and look at exactly what was talked about when we did Apartments, we did say we were looking at other ones. We passed on them based on valuation wanting to focus on our core integrating of apartments and I think it actually makes a lot of sense now what we're doing and rents and repeat will do the same thing over the next, 6, 12, 18 months.
Andy Florance: Yes, I am not buying that stock at that price. I will buy that stock at half that price.
Operator: And thank you for holding. That was our final question. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Andy Florance.
Andy Florance: Thank you very much. I appreciate it and we did not acquire ApartmentFinder because my initials are AF and ApartmentFinder is AF and my favorite color is orange. But anyway thank you for joining us for this earnings call and we look forward to updating you on what's going on in the next quarter and have a good day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your teleconference call for this morning and again thank you very much for your participation and for using the AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.

Andrew C. Florance: Thank you, Rich, appreciate it. And welcome, and thank you for joining us on this snow day in Washington, D.C. I'm happy to have the opportunity to share our very strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2014, our annual revenue increased $135 million over 2013. And we generated annual EBITDA of over $151 million. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year was $188 million. We achieved revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 of $156 million compared to $116 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, for an increase of 35%. EBITDA increased 36% to $43 million in the fourth quarter 2014 compared to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew to $0.93 per share in the same period. Our annual subscription business continues to enjoy a high trailing 12-month renewal rate of 92% with 98% renewal for those customers with us 5 years or longer. Our investment in the expansion of our sales force is going well. In 2014, we added over $63 million of annualized net new business. We achieved CoStar's highest-ever net new sales on annual contracts with $17.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. As we discussed last quarter, we signed a onetime, one-off $1 million advertising contract in Q4 of 2013. So when you adjust for that contract our net new sales actually grew 17% year-over-year. Our field sales force continues to do an excellent job as the pace of net new sales for CoStar's core business accelerated 36% in the fourth quarter of 2014 over the third quarter of 2014 and 26% year-over-year. As we reach a new stable state with our larger sales force, our sales reps will gain more experience and we fully expect to see an increase in per rep productivity and higher net new sales overall. With successful service offerings like CoStar, LoopNet and Apartments.com, our sales force has absolutely no shortage of products to sell. Over time we plan for -- prepare most of our sales force to sell all three services to streamline the relationship with our clients and prospects, and maximize their efficiency. We acquired Apartments.com less than a year ago in April of 2014. Before we had even closed the deal, our product design team had put forth a Herculean effort, and had redesigned the site from top to bottom. While we felt that Apartments.com was a great company with a good product, we also knew the industry is highly competitive and changes rapidly, so we needed to ensure that our product would lead the industry. We understand that other competing sites with significant revenue were working in aging business models and that there was a unique opportunity to reinvent the space with a more renter-centric website. We believe that if Apartments.com gives renters what they want and need, then we'll be able to give our paying advertisers the quality leads they want. We focused on building a site with more powerful and responsive mapping and searching tools. One of CoStar Group's core competencies is collecting and building content. We felt that renters really wanted a more comprehensive inventory of rentals, including condos and houses, with actual rents and availabilities, so they can narrow down their search for an apartment without having to call every other building in town. We also learned from renters and apartmenters that they believed there was no prominent, trusted, clear, branded website that stood out on the Internet for finding an apartment. After we closed the Apartments.com acquisition, our entire team from LoopNet, CoStar and Apartments came together with a clear purpose: To build the best apartment website ever built. After thousands of my colleagues worked countless intense hours, we believe that we have built the best website ever, connecting renters with apartments and connecting owners with renters. We relaunched the new Apartments.com 10 days ago to an incredibly positive reaction from both customers and renters and 1 or 2 investors. The site has dramatically more listings, vastly improved search tools and user experience and state-of-the-art search engine optimization. We are seeing early positive trends. It's obviously early, but we like what we're seeing initially. I am very pleased to report that we've seen a huge surge in organic traffic since the launch. Year-over-year, visits to Apartments.com are up a very impressive 74%. Since the launch, week-over-week visits are up 23%. For the important SEO keywords we track, 336 additional keywords for Apartments.com have moved up to the top 5 positions in Google for a total of 1,407 keywords in the top 5 organic positions. That is 47% more keywords in the top 5 organic positions than Zillow or ApartmentGuide. We also are holding the most prominent position in search engine marketing as well. Telephone leads to our clients are up 56% year-over-year on the site. It's pretty material to our advertisers. I believe that, that underestimates the benefit to our clients, though. On our old site, a renter could not determine if an apartment building had a currently available unit for them without calling the community. At any given time, typically half the bedroom configurations are not available in the community. So we believe approximately half of the old telephone leads were a waste of the owner's time, and a waste of the renter's time. Now our site shows current availability, so it is more likely that when the prospective renter calls, they are calling to schedule a tour rather than to do an availability check. It's amazing how simple it is. We know the site is more engaging because since the relaunch, the average length of the visit to the site is up 39% from that on the old site. Site performance is key to keeping renters on your site, so the speed of the site was one of our key engineering concerns in building the new Apartments.com. The average time to download a page on the old Apartments.com was exactly 639 milliseconds. But the new site -- I'm kidding, approximately 639 milliseconds. But the new site is 344% faster, with an average download time of about 144 thousandths of a second, dramatically faster. And we're going to make it even faster still. The relaunch of the site has confirmed the validity of a key element of our strategy for the new site. The site now allows landlords to list a property for free on the site, and for increasing levels of investment, they can achieve more prominent placement on the site. If you can list for free on the site, then paid placements better offer a significant advantage. The good news, and I was really happy to see it, is that now, the site is live, it clearly appears that the advertising opportunities offer a huge advantage to our advertisers. The advertising levels are silver, gold, platinum and diamond. Since the relaunch, the silver ads have been viewed twice as many times per listing as the free listings. The gold placements are viewed 6x more frequently as the free ones, and the platinum levels have been viewed 13x more often than free. And the diamond ads have been viewed 26x more frequently than free. The paid properties are receiving significantly more leads than the free properties and the business premise is solid. This is basically the core premise of Google's revenue stream. We believe that building the most traffic site is key to building the most -- the highest revenue-generating site. I'm very proud of the enormous traffic gains our team has accomplished for the relaunch of the site, but what is even more impressive is that we have accomplished these impressive gains before our planned transformative consumer marketing campaign has even begun, featuring Jeff Goldblum. The Apartments.com marketing campaign kicks off Sunday, March 1, with a placement on the very popular hit show, "The Walking Dead" in the 9:00 to 10:00 p.m. slot. And I hope everyone will watch it, even though the show has a little bit of a gory side to it. According to a study conducted by Kip Casino [ph] of Burrell Associates, landlords will spend $1.5 billion in online advertising in 2015, up from $630 million last year. We believe our new website and aggressive branding campaign will give us a decisive competitive edge as we pursue a significant share of this $1.5 billion online advertising. We believe the combination of CoStar and Apartments will position us to benefit from the significant information and marketing cross-sell opportunity we see in multifamily. Our rent comp reports will help property managers and owners set their rents with accurate, real-time information for their markets. Because of the efforts we have invested to build great content for renters on Apartments.com, those who subscribe to CoStar information will now get even deeper, richer, faster information on the multifamily markets. We are confident we will be the only company that will be able to deliver to property managers and owners a marketing solution with comprehensive information and analytics for an exceptional price. We have bundled these powerful resources together. We had a phenomenal sales month for Apartments. We had a phenomenal sales month in January for Apartments.com, even before the release of the new site. The month of February is more about customer service. The sales team's primary objective is to explain the features of the new site to our many, many clients for Apartments.com, rather than having the sales force just focus on acquiring new customers. We want to make sure the existing customers are happy with what we're doing. So we anticipate a modest February net new sales launch in the Apartments.com space. We are very optimistic though about the potential for the March sales. Despite our current customer service priority, we are already seeing some sizable cross-selling deals that we really like. Giving a couple of examples, the ValCap Group has been a CoStar customer for some time. I believe since 2013. A CoStar sales rep brought in an Apartments.com sales rep to meet with them, and the team sold them a competitive $7,000 a month advertising contract covering 11 properties. And that contract was a share shift from one competing company to us. Oculus Realty is an Apartments.com client based in Gaithersburg, Maryland and owns 22 communities. We added CoStar Information for $5,600 per month, and took the business away from Reese. [ph] So in one case adding advertising to a CoStar customer, and in another case, advertising CoStar to an Apartments customer. In each case, sales reps from Apartments.com and CoStar worked together to secure these deals, and we think the cooperation of those 2 teams and the joint efforts will be critical to a really great sales year. If you have not yet visited the new Apartments.com, I really encourage you to do so. The site looks great, and we have no shortage of great ideas to keep making the site even better throughout the years. We've made a number of significant enhancements to CoStar Suite over the past year that have made the product more powerful and made accessing our content even easier. We have now integrated our portfolio strategy, web-based market analytics and forecasting tool into CoStar Property, giving our customers a great 30,000-foot view of the markets, right down to the very granular information, all in one integrated package. We will continue to build valuable information analytic tools on this new platform for commercial owners, lenders and institutional investors and regulators. This quarter, we are releasing an important new feature within CoStar Suite called CoStar Lease Comps. And in fact, we already have it in beta use with several big customers. These comparables are one of the most valuable assets that a broker and their firms have when dealing with their clients but oftentimes the comps are only embedded in dispersed in-house Excel spreadsheets, which means they are very difficult to access or share and not integrated with other useful data and are often nonstandardized. CoStar Lease Comps functionality allows our subscribers to enter, manage, share and analyze all their proprietary lease comp information within CoStar Suite. With CoStar Lease Comps, brokers can leverage CoStar Research to supplement managed information on their own lease transactions by adding CoStar Research Lease Comps to their information. This lets them build a bigger and more accurate picture of the market and allows them to help their clients make more optimized pricing decisions. And ultimately, I think, will be very good for industry transparency and the health of the commercial real estate market. We believe that CoStar's lease comps will provide brokers and their firms the best way to manage, control and protect their lease information. They can aggregate lease comps across multiple office locations or firms. It gives them the opportunity to have standardized lease comp collection across their firms, and it standardizes effective rent calculations across their firms. It lets firms run their lease comps through our analytics and reporting engines. It's a win-win between CoStar and our clients. It gives our clients a much-needed timesaving productivity and intelligence tool. As these brokers put more and more of their content in the CoStar environment to get value from it, it makes the CoStar product even stickier. As you know, LoopNet is by far the most trafficked website for finding office, industrial and retail space for lease and for sale, and we continue to monetize that traffic growth. In the fourth quarter of 2014, average monthly unique visitors on LoopNet.com was approximately 5 million, up 12% from 4.4 million in Q4 2013. In January 2015, we experienced an all-time unique visitor total -- all-time high unique visitor total for LoopNet at 5.8 million unique visitors. In fact, during January of 2015, loopnet.com, cityfeet.com, bizbuysell.com, and landandfarm.com each experienced all-time high unique visitor traffic. Revenue for the LoopNet Marketplace grew approximately 20% in 2014 compared to 2013. This continues to compare very favorably to the single-digit growth rate LoopNet had prior to our acquisition of the company. Additionally, we continue to evolve our product offering, concentrating on giving our paying advertisers in LoopNet new and more differentiated ways to market their commercial real estate availabilities and properties for sale. As with Apartments.com, we are launching 3 differentiated advertising levels on LoopNet. These ad levels provide larger ads and more exposure to those advertisers that invest more marketing dollars with us. We are offering those who pay us the most for listings the opportunity to sort to the top for relevant search results with large, prominent ads. We believe that will allow them to lease their properties more quickly, generate more leads, sell their properties more quickly. And it will have a positive impact on LoopNet's revenue. This enhancement, along with the ability to buy new, more flexible premium listing plans, targeted ads for brokers, properties and company-branding ads and property videos gives our advertisers fantastic opportunities to showcase both their properties and themselves on LoopNet.com and provides revenue growth for us. In an effort to eliminate internal price competition between LoopNet's legacy information proxy and CoStar, we have significant increased prices for new customers of LoopNet's suite of information products. LoopNet Premium Searcher is now listed at $444 a month. That's actually LoopNet Platinum Searcher is now listed for $444 per month on a month-to-month basis. If you buy it on an annual contract, it's now $395 a month. That's close to a 500% price increase over what LoopNet was charging for a similar service effectively when we acquired the company. So it's a significantly -- significant boost in cost there. Ultimately, we want to transition all of our information clients to one platform, that will be the CoStar information platform, that will reduce cost and we believe increase the quality of the information platform overall by having a greater participation in one community or one clearinghouse of information. CoStar Real Estate Manager increased its net new sales by an impressive 58% in 2014 over the full year of 2013. Real Estate Manager also posted its highest quarterly net new sales in Q4 of 2014. In Q4 of '14 and rolling into Q1 of this year, we were able to increase the number of customers capitalizing on the use of both CoStar Suite and CoStar Real Estate Manager. Subscription revenues for CoStar Real Estate Manager grew 17% in 2014 versus 2013. In 2014, we experienced record growth in the number of new retailers, corporate tenants and healthcare companies joining the CoStar Real Estate Manager customer base, with 24 major new customer additions in 2014. Significant new customers in Q4 included Sunoco's retail stores, Kindred Healthcare and Ansford. [ph] In Q4, we released integration of select CoStar property information with the CoStar Real Estate Manager product, allowing retailers and corporate tenants to begin to see the power of CoStar information combined with our own lease and portfolio information. In 2015, designs are underway to allow retailer and corporate customers to view their own lease and portfolio information inside the CoStar Suite environment, increasing the value of CoStar collection of products to this customer segment, and offering a product that no other company, we believe, can -- is out there can offer that kind of combined solution. We expect that this will continue to increase the opportunity for us to sell both products in this market. CoStar in the United Kingdom has growing profitability and continues to convert clients and prospects to CoStar Suite. We added 700 customers to CoStar Suite in the first 700 days since the launch of the product there. Average subscription price increases have maintained the same high level as we achieved at the original launch date. The price increases have been averaging 39%, as people upgrade from our old FOCUS product to our CoStar Suite product. In the U.K., the renewal rate has steadily increased during the past year, with a trailing 1-year renewal rate moving from 90% at the start of 2014 to 91% at the end of the year. So with the conversion to CoStar Suite in the U.K., we have seen a steady march up in the renewal rates over the last several years. This has been helped by the number of multi-year contracts that we signed. 46% of U.K. CoStar Suite customers have signed either 2- or 3-year agreements. December was a record-breaking month in the U.K., achieving the highest-ever net new sales in the company's U.K. history. And 5 of the top 8 highest ever sales months were in 2014. As a result, in 2014, our U.K. operation achieved the highest yearly net new sales ever, and we expect strong momentum to continue in 2015. EBITDA in the U.K. also improved to $5.4 million from 2 point -- $3 million the prior year, versus a loss of $3.1 million -- no way, I'm sorry. Let me get that right. EBITDA improved $5.4 million to $2.3 million versus a loss of $3.1 million in 2013. That's a mouthful. We'll have to try to use a simpler approach next time. The bottom line is, the U.K. is becoming more profitable, and we believe will continue to be more profitable. Again, I want to congratulate our U.K. Managing Director, Charles Newman, and the entire U.K. team on a great performance this year. We are now advancing our plans to retire the older FOCUS product I mentioned completely from the market and expect to complete that before mid-2016. It'd great to be on one platform. Our move into Toronto, Canada has also been successful. We signed over $1.2 million in annual new business, including important wins in the fourth quarter of MPAC and Avison Young. We closed the Toronto year at 250% of our internal sales goals. This makes Toronto one of the fastest-growing markets to obtain this level of adoption in our corporate history. In November, Toronto turned in the highest-ever sales month of any CoStar city ever. So it's quite an accomplishment. Clients in Canada have expressed a clear demand for nationwide Canadian coverage, so we expect to expand into other large cities in Canada during 2015. The commercial real estate markets continue to show a broad level of strength in the fundamentals of rent, net absorption, occupancy and transaction volume. Overall demand as measured by net absorption was strong in 2014. This strong demand has been driven by a 2.1% rate of job growth and shrinking excess capacity within existing tenant spaces, which in the past, had constrained the overall demand for space. Rental rates rose an average of 3.6% across all property types in 2014 versus 2.2% growth a year earlier. Capital flows continue to remain at record levels. In 2014, we had a 10% increase in property sales to over $0.5 trillion, which is above the previous peaks in 2006 and 2007, when sales averaged $486 billion. Looking at the apartment sector. Performance was solid in '14, with a 3.2% increase in rents for the year. After a cycle of low vacancy in 2013, the national apartment vacancy rate climbed to 4.8% in Q4 of '14, versus 4.4% one year earlier. A significant 27% increase in apartment completions from '13 was the primary reason for the rise in vacancy, as net absorption for 2014 was similar to '13's level. Apartment sales transactions reached the highest levels ever recorded in 2014, up 6% from 1 year earlier to $120 billion. In the office sector, we had 80% higher net absorption to 91 million square feet in 2014. This is nearly double the level of net completions, so vacancy fell by 70 basis points to 11.3%, which is very close to the long-term average. New supply in office remains at historically low levels. Falling vacancies spurred a 30% year-over-year rise in the amount of office space under construction as of Q4 2014. Office sales volumes rose 11% in 2014 to $124 billion. Retail had an exceptionally strong sales year. The volume was up 22% to a record $100 billion. Clearly, the headwinds of Internet retail aren't preventing a flow of capital to the sector. The industrial sector had results very similar to '13, specifically market vacancies declined to the lowest level in 15 years, ending 2014 at 6.8% versus 7.4% a year earlier. This is significantly lower than the 7.6% low attained in 2007. We're getting very full utilization of a lot of our commercial real estate sectors right now. In 2000 -- 2014 was an excellent and transformative year overall. I believe we are on our way to $1 billion in revenue and 40% margins in 2018. With our investment in Apartments.com as well as advances in CoStar information analytics and LoopNet, I believe that we are exceptionally well positioned for strong growth and financial successes for many years to come. At this point, I will return the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, who you may know, Brian Radecki.
Brian J. Radecki: Did you take a breath, Andy. So what is that, download times are down, what? They're 344% faster? But the earnings call's up how many minutes, Rick?
Richard Simonelli: 7 milliseconds.
Andrew C. Florance: Depends on how fast you read your script.
Brian J. Radecki: I was crossing out paragraphs as Andy was just reading off all my numbers. I was like, "Well, I don't have to talk about that. Well, let's not talk about that." But I'll reread a couple just because I know you guys you want to hear me. Thanks, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2014. CoStar Group's organic business continues to show solid top line growth, while we grew earnings, all while we made exceptional progress integrating Apartments.com and investing for the long term. Our strong 2014 performance has created an opportunity for us to further invest in research and marketing in 2015. As discussed in last week's call, seems like we're talking to these guys every other day, we have begun to do so, and we will continue to invest through 2015, which we believe will accelerate revenue growth for many years to come. Starting with CoStar Group's results for the fourth quarter 2014, the company reported $156.1 million of revenue, an increase of 35% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, revenues were $575.9 million, an increase of $135 million or approximately 30.6% for the full year 2013. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $54.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, which is an increase of $13.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Another way to look at it, is that we had $217 million of Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.8% for the fourth quarter 2014. Now this is, again, all while we're investing in research as we discussed prior. Adjusted EBIT for the full year 2014 was $188.5 million, which is an increase of 37.8% or $51.7 million compared to the full year 2013. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to an all-time high of approximately 33% for the full year 2014. Net income for the fourth quarter 2014 was $13.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million from the $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $29.8 million or $0.93 per diluted share, which is a 34% increase from 2013. Did you give that number? Gross margins was $113.2 million for the fourth quarter or 72.5% of revenue, which again includes the majority investments as research -- in research that we've discussed and is essentially unchanged from Q4 2013. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP and income, EBITDA adjusted EBITDA and all the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail along with definitions for those terms in our press release issued yesterday and are available at www.costar.com. Or if you didn't catch that because I went too fast, just email getrich@costar.com. Get rich.
Richard Simonelli: Rich Simonelli.
Brian J. Radecki: No, just get getrich@costar.com, it will go right to him. Cash and investments increased $36.9 million to $544.2 million as of December 31, 2014, up from last quarter. Cash and investments exceeded total short and long-term debt of $385 million as of December 31. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $47.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and was $143.9 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, which continues to demonstrate the very, very strong cash flow profile of our business. Now I'd like to give you some additional color and some metrics to highlight -- further highlight our strong performance in Q4 of 2014. As of December 31, we had approximately 504 total salespeople across the company. Of that, 219 were sort of U.S. CoStar field sales reps and 136 were Apartment field sellers, up from 80 at the time of the acquisition. Now after our February sales conference, all these reps are working together, in the field, under one management structure. Additionally, we had approximately 87 inside reps across CoStar, LoopNet and Apartments, 22 field reps in the U.K. and another 40 across our other verticals and businesses. Revenue from subscription services annual contracts was $103.4 million for the fourth quarter or 66.2% of revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31. Subscription revenue from annual contracts was $389.7 million, up 19% for the 12-month period ended 2013, reflecting our continued success in growing these annual subscriptions faster than our non-subscription services. The year-over-year growth in annual subscription revenue remained at approximately 19% to 20% for the past 6 quarters, which is pretty important to remember. We expect to continue to grow revenue from subscription services on annual contracts back up into the 70s this year and eventually back into the 80%, 90% range of our total revenue as we move forward. Renewal rates for annual subscriptions remained high during the quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar subscription base revenue was 91.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. As we've discussed the last few quarters, the introduction of more annual contracts at Loop, and eventually Apartments, into our subscription base is expected to cause the 12-month renewal rate to edge down slightly, possibly a percent or 2, over the next year or so. Therefore, we'll expect it to be in the 90% to 91% range. The renewal rate of CoStar subscribers who've been with us for 5 years, as Andy mentioned, and never hurts to mention again, is approximately 98%. Hotel California. With the February 17 press release, that was last week, announcing the launch of the new Apartments.com site and the increased investment and marketing for the site, we provided 2015 guidance ranges for revenue and non-GAAP and income per diluted share. These outlook ranges are already incorporated in the exact Q4 2014 results we released last night, as well as the marketing investments we announced last week. Not surprising, a week later, there have been no changes to those projections. So I'm reaffirming my guidance ranges for the first quarter of 2015 and the full year. Our model has not changed and therefore, I assume yours hasn't either. And I'm not going to reread the results, even though my team wrote it because Rich told me he was going to turn the music on. So in summary, I'm very pleased with the CoStar's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. Our strong cash flow profile and adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in 2014 is allowing us to continue to invest in the business to propel future revenue growth for many, many years. We achieved a 35% adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, an increase over the prior quarter, even with increased levels of research investment. Thanks, Fred Carchedi. With the investment in marketing for Apartments mostly weighted towards the first half of 2015, we expect margins to be back in the low to mid-30% range by Q4 this year. Beyond 2015, the marketing spend for Apartments, as Andy mentioned, will be lower and is discretionary. It will be based on our success in driving accelerated revenue growth and market share gains. I remain confident we can deliver mid-teens revenue growth all along the path to our $1 billion in annual revenue goal by 2018, with 40-plus percent adjusted EBITDA margins. And to AJ, who's done North Carolina on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google Hangouts and every other social media ever invented, I'm not sure how the guy gets any work done. He asked the question: How are we going to do this? How are we going to get it to $1 billion and 40%? Well, we're going to invest to build the best content software user experience of our products and services, and now we're going to tell everybody about it by marketing it. As always, I look forward to sharing our progress towards these goals with you in the coming quarters, assuming we can dig out from this snowmageddon here in DC. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.
Darren R. Jue - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's actually Darren Jue on for Sterling. Just a question about research staff hiring. Just given that the cost of sales in the quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting, I was just wondering if you were -- if you made all of the hires that you had planned to make in the quarter? And did you end up seeing that -- I think it was a $4 million to $5 million impact that you guided to last quarter?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. This is Brian. So I think we did a great job. I mean, we added hundreds of researchers. Frank Carchedi and his group did an amazing job collecting the content. We probably were at the low end of that range. So we definitely got the majority of the cost structure and people in the door that we wanted to. Probably a little bit more spilled over in Q1 than I would expect. As you get into Q2 and forward, you'll see the gross margins begin to climb again. So I'd say we got the majority of it in there. There's probably maybe a million or so that will spill over into Q1.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Michael Huang with Needham & Company.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: It's great to see, kind of the strength in unique visitors across LoopNet and the other properties. I was wondering, are you guys doing something different on the marketing front? Or is there some external driver here as well?
Brian J. Radecki: All the traffic we're talking about right now is pre the major B2C marketing spend. The -- on the LoopNet side, there is no material change in our marketing spend. In fact, it's probably a slight reduction from prior year. It's basically better -- we're bringing a little bit more of an investment in search engine marketing this year in LoopNet. Certainly, a significant increase in search engine marketing in Apartments.com. A little bit of an increase in Land and Farm and Lands of America. But big picture it is mostly effective SEO and content advantage. That won't be true next quarter and the following quarter, I hope. I believe that then you'll see organic traffic is being heavily influenced by major B2C media spends on the Apartments.com side.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just wanted to be clear on your plans for the sales force. You've made a big hiring increase last year. You've talked a lot about blending them and being able to cross-sell and cross-train the sales force. So what -- if you can speak to what your planned sales increase -- sales headcount increases are for 2015 and maybe if that's the -- if it's even a relevant metric anymore to focus on, say, CoStar information field sales.
Andrew C. Florance: I think the -- it's a good point. So I think that you can just focus on total field sales people, because the vast majority of our salespeople are now whether in Apartments or CoStar, they're focusing on selling annual contracts wherever possible with high-renewal potential. So it's just basically field sales in the core product areas. We are -- we feel that at this point, with the acquisition of Apartments.com, the growth that occurred in their sales force since the acquisition, and the growth that occurred in the CoStar sales field sales force in the course of 2014. At this point, we have a very large field sales force. And you put them all together in one room at the sales conference, and you see we have a very large field sales force. And right now, what's really important is training, productivity gains, teaming, effective segmentation of that sales force, and I don't really feel like right now it's about headcount growth. It's about effective segmentation and crosstraining and teaming, making sure that the most experienced reps in a particular area are handling the highest-value opportunities in that particular area. And that's a lot of work to do during 2015. That's where we're going to be focusing on. We might see some growth in a couple of areas, that's going to be minor. It won't really move the dial. We are going to grow our field sales force that's dedicated to only our rural land products. We still believe that's a diamond in the rough. Maybe many diamonds in the rough. And then we also may begin to build a little bit more of a dedicated farmer account management model in some of these much larger accounts like CB Richard Ellis or Bank of America, some of these large groups where -- as we deploy more and more software upgrades that we think will be very valuable to them, we want to make sure that they know how to use them and that they get deployed. And we can pay for that by selling LoopNet subscriptions to individuals as we go into those accounts. So we can actually fund our own account management process, I think, through LoopNet subscriptions. So I do not think that the headline of 2015 will be headcount growth in sales force. It'll have to be changing conditions in '16 or '17 that cause that.
Brian J. Radecki: And just add to Andy's brief response, the -- I gave both numbers because I think most people have their models, separated into two. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we certainly look at them in one bucket now and as Andy said, we obviously have pockets of areas, whether it's debt and equity or in the other verticals that we might add some. But I think, in general, we'll be focused on productivity gains. When you look out to, your one -- your 3-, 5-year model, I mean, we will probably then go back to sort of increasing the size by 10% to 15%. But I think, for this year, there could be movements within the numbers, but it's going to be plus or minus that 500 or so number. So thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: My question is about the LoopNet price increase on the info biz, and it's kind of a 2-part question. one, is the $15 million to $20 million of sunsetting rev in that LoopNet info biz, is that driven by the price increases? Or is there some official turning off of some of that product? And then #2, what is the kind of take rate or cross sale rate that you've seen, or if people move off the LoopNet info biz, characterize how they're moving on to the CoStar info biz?
Andrew C. Florance: Okay. So Fred, good question, good spot, that was the line that you should notice and say, wow, that's a heck of a movement. So we are trying to -- I mean, we're certain that we want to migrate everyone from the LoopNet platform over to the CoStar information platform, for so many reasons. We are -- we obviously see huge revenue gains when we move someone from the LoopNet to the CoStar platform. Just see very steady price increases. We also see a more satisfied customer. We see higher renewal rates overall, once we move them into the CoStar information platform. We had wanted to -- we wanted to stop selling LoopNet information products this year in the first quarter, but realistically, given all the opportunities in the apartment sector, we did not want our sales force to be putting all their efforts into the LoopNet up-sell right now. So we, rather than just shut off the e-commerce models of selling LoopNet information, we decided to bring the price up to parity with entry-level CoStar. Now initially, as we do that, we're actually retaining about 80 -- with these very high price increases, we're retaining 80% of the revenue we were seeing before, but we certainly are not going to be suffering the same sort of cannibalization effect. So I think we're seeing an over -- we'll see an overall net increase of information sales without distracting the sales force. The other thing we want to do is, when we do sunset the LoopNet information, we want to make sure that we've integrated the back ends, and that you have, always in every case, in any submarket, any product type, higher-quality information in CoStar across the board and unified data entry. So that's something that's going to take us most of the year. So the goal is that in 2016, we will begin to sunset all that revenue. And we believe that as we sunset that revenue of probably $40-some million, that we could, over a several-year period, see up to $250 million of revenue come into the CoStar side in an optimistic sense. And then you see a reduction in cancellations associated with people going to our bargain-basement product offering. So Brian, do you want to add anything?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. So from German to English. What it means is that, we continue to test the various things. We talked about the Orlando experiment. Essentially, what we're doing here is that, when we get to the end of the year, the $40 million will likely be less by -- with LoopNet, that base is a high churn, month to month. So as people are churning, we're not letting them come back in at a lower price, it's a bigger price. So clearly, volumes are significantly down. So, you don't know where those people go. The assumption is, they will come back and our sales force will sell them, what is that time period, 2 months, 6 months, 8 months, 9 months, whatever it is. So the same sunsetting revenue of $14 million to $20 million, I haven't changed that because essentially, you're seeing a lot, a lot lower volume because people are churning out on the monthly side. We are picking up some of those as Andy said, with higher contracts that are more on par with the CoStar Information. Essentially, you're getting the same result without having to sort of turn it off by doing price increases. So we continue, as we've mentioned in the past, to test various ways to carefully transition these people, from one bucket to the other, but ultimately, the financial result for this year is going to be the same, I believe, within that same range. So we'll just keep updating as we move forward, so.
Andrew C. Florance: And we remain very confident. As we look at granular level data in this LoopNet book, you've got tens of thousands of people who've been using LoopNet as an information product continuously for multiple years and intensely. We do not believe that those people will go away forever and we do not believe that those people will find a better value in some other information solution. So we believe that we will capture a major piece of that client base at a higher price point with a higher renewal rate.
Operator: We do have a question from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First, I just want to follow up on the last one, just to make sure I heard the math right. Because there are a few numbers embedded in there. I think I heard 80% of the revenue for LoopNet being retained as you increase the pricing. But then I also know that you had said something about actually being net up, because these people are paying higher prices. So I just want to make sure that, kind of got the moving parts right there. Was it 80% of the customers are staying, or is it 80% of the volume?
Brian J. Radecki: So I have to clarify, Andre. So Andre, so the -- so on the e-commerce, which is the only place where we're currently selling LoopNet information products. As we increase the price dramatically to be on par with entering into a 1-person, low end CoStar information contract, the volume of the LoopNet sales goes way down, is going way down, but the price being up, you are still retaining 80% of that revenue pace from the LoopNet e-commerce module. Higher price, lower volume. Now without a doubt, every time we sell a -- in the past, when we were selling a Premium Searcher account for $74 a month, rather than $250 a month, you are getting a substitution effect against CoStar information, which would be priced at $250, $395 for one user in a secondary market. So with the increase in prices occurring on the LoopNet e-commerce information platform, you should see a reduction and substitution effect or cancellation against CoStar. So I believe that net-net, your overall CoStar Group corporate headquarter umbrella information revenue is going up. So roughly the same revenue coming in the LoopNet e-commerce model. And a reduction in cancellations on the CoStar side or reduction in loss of the CoStar side. And more people opting to take the higher-quality CoStar information, if the prices are about the same. Did I make that -- is that about clear?
Brian J. Radecki: And I'll follow up with that. I mean, so Andre, as far as the models go, the financial models, our model hasn't changed as far as the revenue range. You're still moving -- your -- the goal is again, to still move people from one bucket to the other. We're just testing different ways of doing it. And the price increases that we talked about have been less than a week. So again, I'm not changing my model. I wouldn't recommend anybody else's. As we talked about on prior calls, we have the ability to pull the lever. So we can obviously control that. But our goal is to -- is quickly as we can, move everybody from one bucket to the other. When you do that, you'll have a bunch of people that drop out for 2 or 3 quarters, which will cause the, whatever the range was, $15 million -- $14 million to $20 million. But again, we believe that, as you get into 2016 and '17, you'll pick all that up by multiples of 3, 4, 5x. So financially modeling, it ends up to be the same place. We're just getting there a little bit different way, which makes it easier on our sales force. So thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Peter Lowry with JMP Securities.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: What impact, if any, do you see from such a strong push on Apartments.com branding on CoStar branding?
Brian J. Radecki: Okay, good question. I think that for people in the know, people in the industry, especially people who are operating in both office industrial and multifamily or retail and multifamily, you will definitely get a halo effect over to the CoStar brands. We did make the decision to streamline the branding of -- in the campaign. We considered branding the commercials, Apartments.com powered by CoStar Group. But we felt that it was much more important to keep a simple, clean message in the renter's mind, the simplest possible URL. And just throw on a halo effect. It -- when we go and talk to customers, remember that we're not just trying to sell advertising on Apartments.com. We're trying to sale an awful lot of information solutions on the CoStar side. So when people see -- what we're seeing when owners of commercial properties and apartment buildings see this branding campaign, Apartments.com, and the acquisition of Apartments.com by the CoStar Group, they attribute, an attribute of much higher quality apartment information now in CoStar Group than anywhere else. So we are getting -- they really latch onto that, and we are getting a benefit from that. We will get a benefit from that. And that one contract I mentioned is an example of that. We'll see more of that.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Phil Stiller with Citi.
Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess, I wanted to ask about Apartments.com. I guess, first what was the revenue in the fourth quarter? And then maybe you could talk about the assumptions implicit in the 2015 guidance in terms of revenue from Apartments.com. Just trying to understand what benefits you're assuming from the marketing spend in the first half of the year?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure, yes. And so, Apartments -- the actual Q4 revenue is down slightly over Q3, which is sort of what's expected, and sort of -- sort of like LoopNet, Q4 is always usually down from Q3, and then up in Q1. They did well year-over-year. I think it was again, around a 15%, 16% year-over-year growth rate. The expectations for this year, I think, I was pretty clear in the last call, but I can clarify a little bit more is that, as we move from one side to the other, in February, there's small buckets of loss revenues. So the revenue for -- their actual revenue for Q1 will probably be lower as you transition from one site to the other. And then the marketing campaign starts in March and really runs through September, the heavy piece of it. So reality is, I believe you'll start to see the contracts or, we'll obviously have contracts coming in by the next call, but I think we'll be talking about that, but I think the reality is, a good cross-sell number and the bulk of it will really come in the July call, where we'll be talking about the success of the campaign. Because you're not going to have 1 month out there. You're going to 4 months of activity out there. So I believe that you'll get the actual GAAP revenue for that to start to come in, in Q3 and really by Q4 and then Q1 of next year, where you'll see the acceleration, I think, out of the teens and, as you get into next year, into the 20s. So you're not going to see -- I mean, you could see it, but I think reality is, you actually have to market it for 3 or 4 months, you have to go sell it and then you got to get in your revenue, so there's not much expectations in the model for this year.
Andrew C. Florance: Brian, would it change your thinking at all if I were to tell you I just got a text from Adam Silverman, that he just got a 3-year deal with Paradigm, a great multifamily company for advertising and CoStar information combined value, $14,000 net new monthly, a 3-year deal. This is from an industry that historically only signed 6-month contracts. Does that change your thinking at all?
Brian J. Radecki: Doesn't change my model. But I'm awfully confident though. Thank you.
Operator: And we do have a question from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: The -- a question on Apartments.com, and the contract structure. Because as you mentioned, historically you've been selling under -- they were annual contracts but cancelable after 6 months. As you're going to market now, are you using annual, noncancelable contracts? Do you -- how have those been received, and are you planning to stick to that? And what impact does that potentially have in terms of recognition and net new?
Brian J. Radecki: So we -- the industry, had historically done a lot of 6-month contracts. When you're dealing with a 250-unit building, you're never going to run out of the need to market that building. So I think the 6-month contracts are more an artifact of the fact that no one was differentiating their brand in a material way. But when we go in there, we offer people a significant discount on information product they're very interested in getting. And we give them some flexibility to add and remove communities, and we're talking about a 20-community owner. We think we can do, like that contract that just came in, we think we can do annual deals. Because that makes sense. That's like baseline annual leases with their renters, why not do annual deals for marketing? We will still take 6-month deals in some instances, we pay a different commission rate to our salespeople. But remember, when we did LoopNet, everything was month to month, and we transitioned that to overwhelmingly annual deals. And we think the same opportunity exists here. It gives you much more visibility in your revenue. And you can do it.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, so Bill, just to add quickly on to that. I mean, it is a lot like LoopNet. I mean, they're a year and they're cancelable after 6 months, and they're essentially month-to-month after that. So this is, sort of, an industry that's used to that. So we are going out with annual contracts, but just like with LoopNet, we have to sort prove that we can actually sell it, since this was rolled out a little bit over a week ago. We have texts and e-mails of individual stories. But the reality is, we have to do it. I'm fairly confident when you look at, our goal always, our core business model to, when I talked about it earlier, was we used to be 90% plus subscription revenue. After LoopNet, we dropped down to like 70%, then we got it back up 80%, and now with this, we dropped down to the low 60s. I think we will be -- I mean, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, by the end of next year, I think we'll be back up into the high 60s or 70%, and in the following years, I think we can get back to 80% and 90%. But it'll take a little while. I mean, I don't expect every single deal that's going to come in is going to be on an annual contract. We're not going to kick them out if they don't. It will take time to sort of get the industry used it. So it'll happen over time. Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, I turn it back over to the host for closing remarks.
Andrew C. Florance: I want to thank everyone for joining us for this fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. And we look forward to updating you on the progress we're making in the business next quarter. Thank you, all, for joining us. I'm sorry for running 4 minutes late. Brian, you owe them 4 minutes.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CoStar Group Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, the conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Richard Simonelli. Please go ahead, sir.
Richard Simonelli: Thank you, very much operator, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the CoStar Group's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Thanks for joining us. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I have some really important facts for you that I believe you'll find quite informative. First, certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in our October 29, 2014, press release on third quarter results and our filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2014, under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar at the time of this call, and we assume no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As a reminder, today's call is being broadcast live and in color over the Internet at www.costargroup.com, where you can also find CoStar's Investor Relations page. A replay will be available approximately 1 hour after this call concludes and will be available for approximately 30 days. To listen to the replay, call (800) 475-6701 within the U.S. or Canada or (320) 365-3844 outside the United States. The access code is 338195, and a replay will be available on our website soon after the call concludes. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andrew C. Florance: Richard, I can't thank you enough. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report strong financial results in the third quarter of 2014. The investments we are making in our business are paying off, and I believe that they will continue to drive top and bottom line growth for many years to come. Our revenue exceeded $153 million compared to $112 million in the third quarter of 2013, up 36% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA reached $51.8 million for the quarter. We have communicated that one of our primary intermediate goals is to reach $1 billion in revenue with a 40% margin by 2018. So we feel that crossing a $600 million revenue run rate along with a $200 million adjusted EBITDA run rate is encouraging process towards that important goal. EBITDA grew to $44 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $30 million in the third quarter of 2013, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew to $0.87 per share in the same period. Our annual subscription business continues to enjoy a high trailing 12-month renewal rate of 92% with 98% renewal for those customers with us 5 years or longer. Before we get into the main part of the call, I just want to give you an update on what we see out in the commercial real estate markets right now. Market fundamentals continue to improve as a new peak in total employment fuels a real need for space. The recovery in the office, industrial and retail property types has broadly supported growth in occupancy, rents and values. Capital continues to be very attracted to real estate with sales up to 8% above last year's elevated levels. Plus, additional capital is now driving ramped-up office, industrial and multifamily construction. Demand for U.S. real estate remains healthy. And our assessment is that 2015 should continue to be a positive year for real estate demand. Liquidity is strong and trading volume well above historical averages and nearly back to 2007 peaks. The apartment sector is seeing an increase in supply and solid apartment market demand, which is being fueled by low homeownership rates, more people living alone and limited first-time home buying. Apartment vacancy of 4.1% was up only 10 basis points from 4% record low 1 year earlier. Net absorption of units at 153,000 annually, which is very close to 10-year historical average. Construction deliveries have totaled 169,000 units over the past year. That's 21% higher than 1 year ago and more than 3x the 2011 level. The fundamentals are strong without a doubt, but I do worry as to whether or not a bit of a bubble is forming. Cap rates are at all-time lows and prices per unit are at all-time highs. I see more and more deals of cap rates that I would never have thought conceivable in my many years of observing these things. I'm not overly concerned that a potential market adjustment would have a significant negative impact on CoStar because demands for our products grow for many segments in downturns. Also, there's no immediate sign of anything but clear strength. I do have to congratulate our team at CoStar Portfolio Strategies, Hans and the whole crew, because they so loudly and clearly advise their clients to invest aggressively in multifamily starting back in 2009, and that was some good advice to take for sure. In the office sector, market fundamentals continued to improve in the third quarter. The national major markets average vacancy rate is close to both 2005 levels and long-term averages. Positive net absorption was solid with 23 million square feet in the past quarter and 77 million square feet over the past year. At this point, roughly 1/3 of the major national office markets have significant levels of construction. Retail is continuing a slow and steady recovery. But retailers are still opening stores, which is great news for CoStar Real Estate Manager. Retail net absorption hit 19 million square feet in the third quarter, the highest quarterly demand growth since 2008. For industrial, market vacancy and construction are so low that they may be constraining net absorption, and that's driving up rents. Now I'd like to turn to our most recent acquisition. In the 2 quarters since we acquired Apartments.com, we've made significant improvements to the website, which have resulted in more visits and more leads. We rejuvenated the entire look of the site, giving it a cleaner interface and vastly improving the user experience for the apartment consumer. We added a powerful new map-based search tool that consumers love. We eliminated excess inventory banner ads that clutter up the site. While we gave up several million dollars in revenue from these ads, we believe that we can more than make up for it in additional apartment listing sales on a more professional and cleaner-looking website. Our clients have responded positively saying that the listing ads are now the clear focal point of the pages and are presented much more professionally. We have been adding professionally produced video tours for advertised properties. We want our clients and consumers to have the best user experience on the Web in the apartment industry. We have made significant investments in search engine marketing and used our experience from LoopNet to improve search engine optimization. These efforts have contributed to significant increases and site traffic and leads. We believe that the total site visits is the most important measure of a site's consumer traffic and is the most reliable measure of lead generation for advertisers. According to comScore, with which I assume all of you are familiar, we are now #1 in total visits among apartment Internet listing services. When we acquired Apartments.com, we were not. We are thrilled to achieve the site leadership role within just 6 months of closing the acquisition. I believe that our growth in site traffic is coming at the expense of many of the sites we compete with. The most recent comScore traffic numbers available are for the close of September. Year-to-date through September, comScore reports Apartments.com total monthly unique visits have climbed 39%. And visits for our second site, ApartmentHomeLiving, have risen 15%. So comparing the month of January to the month of September, '14, we climbed 39% Apartments.com. That's great news for us. Our competitors' visits, competitors who currently enjoy hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue we don't have, went southward. According to comScore, total monthly site visits to ApartmentGuide.com fell 9%, and its sister site, Rent.com, fell 12% this year through September. ApartmentFinder.com's website visits really fell dramatically this year, losing 52% of their monthly site traffic year-to-date comparing January, September. ForRent.com, also turned in a weak performance, losing 30% of total monthly site visits year-to-date. MyNewPlace.com lost 38% of their total monthly site visits comparing January to September, most recent month. And hotpads.com lost 11%. Again, all these numbers are based upon the work of an independent third-party site-measurement service, comScore. And again to clarify, the 39% growth in monthly site visits and decline numbers for our competitors looking at September 2014 visits comparing them to January 2014 visits, however, as you look at these curves and trends, it basically is a good and accurate representation of what's occurring. Our increased traffic has resulted in large increases in leads to our clients, which are up 24% in the third quarter of 2014 year-over-year, a fantastic increase. In the past several months, we signed up new record numbers of new apartment communities. In 2012, Apartments.com sold an average of 264 new communities each month. And '13, sold an average of 276 new communities each month. In August 2014, we sold dramatically more with 455 new properties. In September 2014, we sold 497 new properties. And we believe that we can cross 500 new properties as the month closes. Is it today, Brian, or tomorrow?
Brian J. Radecki: Tomorrow.
Andrew C. Florance: Tomorrow. So I'd ask the Apartments.com salespeople not to get involved in any Halloween parties, just hit a new record. Many of these properties we're signing up were advertising on competing sites before signing on to Apartments.com. Sylvan Gardens in Philadelphia, River Bluff in Lexington and Marchmont [ph] Terrace in Cleveland, were all advertising on ApartmentGuide, and they're now advertising on Apartments.com. We are taking advantage of our superior site traffic and dramatic lead growth and seizing the green. In April of this year when we acquired Apartments.com, their revenues had grown 9.6% year-over-year in the prior year. That growth has now almost doubled to 18% year-over-year. The Apartments.com sales force is delivering very solid results. Congratulations to Brad and his team. We are very satisfied with the progress we have made. And similar to our experience with LoopNet, we believe we will continue to drive markedly improved postacquisition results. In just 30 months since the close of the LoopNet acquisition, we have achieved nearly $80 million of cross-selling revenue. When added to the over $20 million in cost synergies, we have moved above the $100 million mark in total synergies. We believe we'll continue to have significant upside for the LoopNet cross-selling opportunity for many years to come. I think it is worth noting over the past 6 consecutive quarters, we've experienced double-digit year-over-year increases in the average revenue per user for the LoopNet Premium membership while also dramatically increasing the number of paid listings by 67% since the close of the acquisition to -- we're now running over 50% of all the listings being paid. When added to successfully signing annual subscription contracts and dramatically increasing unique monthly visitors, we are very pleased with our success in the online marketplace space. The LoopNet Marketplace had 45.3 million profile views in the third quarter, up -- I'm sorry, that's 43 -- 45 million profile views in third quarter 2014, and that is up 15% year-over-year. LoopNet also reached an all-time high in unique monthly visitors with 5.5 million in the third quarter 2014, up 55% since the second quarter 2012 when we acquired the business. LoopNet Marketplace revenue for the third quarter 2014 grew 20% over the third quarter of 2013. Average revenue per LoopNet customer continues to improve. Average revenue per premium member climbed 18% to $90.28 in the third quarter 2014 compared to $76.60 last year. It's almost like college tuition. Average revenue per Premium Lister grew 13% year-over-year to $104.41 in the third quarter of 2014. When we first acquired LoopNet, we communicated that our strategy would be to eventually position the LoopNet Marketplace as the premier marketing site for commercial real estate where all listings would be paid, and it would be free to search the site. Additionally, CoStar is positioned as the pay-to-search premium information solution for commercial real estate professionals. We have made significant progress in repositioning these 2 sites into these respective roles. We've converted thousands of brokers who were using LoopNet Premium Searcher, LoopNet's information service, into CoStar subscribers. Nonetheless, we still have approximately 34,000 users paying approximately $40 million annually for LoopNet as an information service. The revenue in this area continues to grow due to price increases as the user base contracts slightly. Premium Searcher competes against both LoopNet Premium Lister and CoStar Property. It's a substitution effect between both of these -- all 3 of these products, so sort of overlapping value propositions. We believe that our clients would get significantly more value from one higher-quality consolidated information solution. Clients using CoStar as an information tool have dramatically higher renewal rates for CoStar than they do for LoopNet Premium Searcher. And they get more value from it, apparently, because they're willing to pay significantly more for CoStar Property and the CoStar Product Suite. Given the significant cost associated with maintaining similar products, we believe that it will be much more efficient to eventually offer only one information product and eventually might come sooner rather than later. We're carefully studying eliminating Premium Searcher and other LoopNet information products entirely with the intention of migrating commercial real estate professionals to CoStar information services as quickly as possible. If we discontinue these LoopNet information services, it might take 1 year or more to do so in a way that does not disrupt our clients. This wind-down might have short-term negative impact on revenue and earnings, but we believe that this will ultimately lead to significantly higher revenue and earnings in the long term, and in fact in the intermediate term measured in a sub-2-year period. We stopped selling LoopNet Premium Searcher as an automatic part of new LoopNet Premium Lister subscriptions earlier this year, and it has not materially affected the price we achieved for the new Premium Lister subscriptions or the revenue. We have also recently conducted a test in Florida where we stopped selling LoopNet Premium Searcher on our website through the E-Commerce engine. And we no longer sell LoopNet Premium Searcher as part of our outbound sales team. While the test in Florida resulted in lower short-term revenue, we believe the test showed that we can achieve much higher revenue over an 18-month or longer period by migrating clients to one information product perhaps as much as twice as much. Our investment in hiring dozens of new salespeople in the latter part of 2013 was slightly disrupted. But we still grew the business by adding over $45 million of annualized net new sales in the first 3 quarters of 2014. In the third quarter 2014, we began to see this investment accelerate sales growth as we expected it would. Annualized net new sales from annual contracts were $15.4 million, which represents an increase of 12% over the third quarter of 2013. Annualized net new sales of services from the CoStar core business were up 25% in the third quarter year-over-year. As our sales force gains more experience, I suspect that we will continue to see increases in annualized net new sales of annual subscription business. We anticipate continuing to grow our sales force into 2015 as we expand our focus on selling to firms involved in commercial real estate debt and equity investments and as we grow our Apartment.com footprint. Moving on to the United Kingdom and the work that Giles and his team is doing. Revenue and earnings growth continue to be strong since we introduced CoStar Suite in the late 2012 time period. Revenue grew 22% in the first 9 months of 2014 compared to the same period last year. Thank you, Matthew. We also achieved a $1.9 million EBITDA in the first 9 months of 2014 compared to $3.9 million EBITDA loss in the same period in 2013. So a very strong and dramatic swing in profitability. In the third quarter 2014, we have the highest-ever revenues in the U.K. The 5 highest net sales months in the U.K. have occurred in the past 16 months, including September 2014. This has been largely due to the continued success of selling CoStar Suite. Contract buys have increased an average of 35% as clients migrate to CoStar Suite from our legacy-focused service offering. We have now sold or converted over 650 clients to the new platform with only 590 FOCUS clients yet to migrate. Margins continue to strengthen as we proactively wind down the lower-margin legacy services and we look to eventually discontinue them completely in the not-too-distant future. I'm very pleased with our success in United Kingdom as this remarkable turnaround demonstrates the power of CoStar information services outside the United States. One important area that is one of our intermediate-term strong potential growth areas is our businesses for sale websites. We operate BizBuySell.com, the Internet's largest Business-For-Sale marketplace; and BizQuest, the second. We recently announced our ranking as the clear industry leader in terms of usage, buyer responses generated and overall satisfaction according to the Business Brokerage Press 2014 industry survey of hundreds of business brokers across the nation. BizBuySell continues to be the most commonly used Business-For-Sale marketplace with 82% of surveyed business brokers saying they use BizBuySell to market their businesses for sale listings. This is the eighth straight Business Brokerage Press survey that BizBuySell.com has taken the top spot. Our second site, BizQuest, was second with 67% of brokers using the site to market businesses for sale. All other national listing exchanges were used by less than 50% of business brokers. These sites are important to us because often business brokers are also commercial real estate brokers. Surveyed brokers, again, credited BizBuySell.com for generating the highest percentage of buyer responses reporting that 39% of total buyer responses received are from BizBuySell. BizQuest.com was second with 13% of buyer responses. Together, BizBuySell and BizQuest were reported to account for more buyer responses than all other competing listing sites combined in the survey. Revenue from these sites grew 13% year-over-year, and EBITDA from these sites grew 40% year-over-year. Turning to Toronto. We're seeing very strong early sales success in Toronto with our launch of CoStar Information and Analytics services earlier this year. The rate of growth in the industry, we believe, far exceeds the rate of growth of any of our competitors and is above our historical benchmarks. When we first got to Toronto, many firms asked us what took us so long to get there. Now many of them have told us they would like to buy more from us if we would expand our coverage to the rest of Canada. As a result, we're listening to that feedback, and we're responding, and we've begun hiring researchers to cover Vancouver, Montréal, Ottawa, Edmonton and Calgary. This is a natural extension of what we're already doing and provides an opportunity for us to penetrate the entire Canadian marketplace. We believe that the overall Canadian market represents hundreds of millions of dollars of opportunity for CoStar. You may have heard that, recently, Forbes Magazine recognized CoStar Group as one of the world's most innovative growth companies. We were ranked #27 on the list of the top 100 innovative companies in the world. CoStar also placed in the top 10 among Forbes' top software and service companies. Our team is extremely proud to be honored by Forbes, and I believe that it's a testament to the innovating spirit of the people of CoStar. I can tell you that our team works extremely hard, innovates continuously, works Sunday and is committed to excellence. Our product designers are subject-matter experts. Our developers, economists, researchers and many others have been justifiably recognized as leading innovators on a worldwide stage. We continue to look for more ways to enable our clients to unlock the value of our superior information and marketing offerings in our large and active communities. During the past 4 quarters, we've been investing in, and we're hard at work on many technology initiatives for the flagship CoStar Suite. We have developed and rolled out 6 releases to CoStar Suite throughout 2014. These releases include a Canadian version of CoStar, a U.K. version of lease analysis, responsive design, tighter integration between our Web CoStar and our mobile product, CoStarGo, a more robust presentation of information in CoStar and a U.K. reporting module. One of the most significant releases we believe that we will complete this year is the integration of CoStar portfolio strategies into CoStar Suite, creating a unique and very powerful new product targeted at owners and lenders. One of the biggest stumbling blocks to acquiring institutional customers who wanted to subscribe to both CoStar Suite and CoStar Portfolio Strategy was the user interface. Up until now, users had to access different websites and use different log-on procedures for the CoStar Suite and CoStar Portfolio Services. So I'd use one site to see the 30,000-foot view of the market, and I would use another site to see the street level view of the market. This is -- this new product puts them all together in one system. During the fourth quarter 2014, we plan to offer a fully integrated website called CoStar Market Analytics with this single sign-on password. This will integrate the granular data in analytics of CoStar Suite with the forecast and analytics of CoStar Portfolio Strategy. We believe this will be a boon to clients and allow us to more easily sell to other institutional prospects, owners, lenders on both the local -- predominantly local, but also and national stage. We believe the change will have significant positive effect on revenue and margins over time. And I can't get -- wait to get out and sell the product. We believe these advances in the CoStar core will allow us to penetrate the U.S. and international markets even more quickly. In particular, we expect to see accelerating sales to owners and lenders. In the first 9 months of 2014, CoStar Portfolio Strategy has already generated its highest net new sales since we acquired it in 2009. In order to respond to some of these demands, in order to expand the quality and breadth in coverage of information services we offer to owners, lenders, institutional clients, and in order to expand the number of markets we cover in Canada, we've begun our to make an investment in hiring more researchers. We've already hired approximately 150 additional researchers so far, and we expect to hire a total of approximately 250 to 300 new researchers overall. Update you briefly on CoStar Real Estate Manager. We've got great positive sales momentum continuing there, and it reached its highest-ever monthly net new sales level in September 2014. Significant new customer additions include ABM industries, Tumi, Godiva, Hanger, Crown Properties and First Citizens Bank. Existing customers also expanded use of CoStar Real Estate Manager modules, including significant additions for Charles Schwab, DaVita Healthcare and Genuine Parts. We are making significant progress with our development plans to provide powerful CoStar data for our CoStar Real Estate Manager customers delivering what we believe will be an unmatchable offering in the retail and corporate real estate management software space. The combination of our talented, passionate employees and commitment to innovations is leading to excellent results and opening ways for CoStar to capture highly profitable revenue. We plan to continue to build upon our leadership position to provide an even better platform that will enable our customers and users of our service to benefit. We are making critical investments in all aspects of our business, and I see 2015 as a pivotal investment year, which will strengthen our platform as we remain intensely focused on our goal of becoming a $1 billion revenue company with 40%-plus margins in 2018. I will now turn the call over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer.
Brian J. Radecki: Wow. Hold on, you guys, I need to help Andy get the oxygen tank turned on. Hold on. Hear, Andy. Here you go.
Andrew C. Florance: I'm only 92.
Brian J. Radecki: So I have a stopwatch in front of me from Rich, so I have to go fast. But the problem is, is that legal keeps extending my script. So if I read fast through parts of it, those are the parts that are very repetitive but, apparently, very necessary. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2014. CoStar Group's organic business continues to show solid top line growth, and EBITDA margins continue to expand while making great progress integrating Apartments.com. The strong year-to-date performance has created an opportunity for us to further invest in our core proprietary data and information assets. We have begun to do so, and we will continue through to 2015 to accelerate future revenue growth. Starting with CoStar's results for the third quarter 2014, the company reported $153.1 million of revenue, an increase of 36% compared to the third quarter of 2013. On a pro forma basis, our year-over-year revenue growth accelerated to 13.9% for the third quarter of 2014 versus the pro forma third quarter of 2013 adjusted to include Apartments.com revenue. EBITDA increased to -- $13.9 million to $43.7 million in the third quarter of 2014, up from $29.8 million, or 47%, for Q3 last year. We reported adjusted EBITDA of over $50 million, $51.8 million to be exact, for the third quarter of 2014, which is an increase of $14.1 million, or approximately 37%, compared to the third quarter of last year. Non-GAAP net income for Q3 of 2014 was $27.9 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, which is a 38% increase in the -- from the third quarter of 2013. Gross margin was $112.1 million for the quarter or 73.3% of revenue. This is an increase from 71.8% of revenue in Q3 of 2013 reflecting the continued strength of the business model. Reconciliations of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all other financial measures discussed in this call under GAAP basis results shown in detail along with definitions for those terms in our press release issued yesterday are available on our website at www.costar.com (sic) [www.costargroup.com]. And if you have any questions, just email jcoleman@costar.com.
Jonathan M. Coleman: I see some real love here.
Brian J. Radecki: Jon is sitting right next to me if you guys can't figure that out. We had words this morning. Cash investments of $507.3 million as of September 30, 2014, an increase of $40.8 million since June of 2014, which -- was driven by the largest quarterly cash flow from operations in our history. Short and long-term debt totaled $390 million. Cash investments, along with the undrawn $225 million revolving credit facility, remains available. Now I'll give some additional color on a few metrics to highlight our strong performance in the third quarter of 2014. As Andy mentioned, we achieved $15.4 million in net new sales of subscription services and annual contracts in the third quarter, an increase of 12.1% over the third quarter of 2013. We're really pleased to be driving double-digit growth in net new sales again in light of the significant changes we made and initiated in late 2013 and the first half of 2014. We expect to carry good sales momentum into the fourth quarter this year and beyond throughout next year, but I should note that we recorded $15.8 million in net new sales and renewal contracts in the fourth quarter of last year. This is a strong performance, and it did include 1 large deal for approximately $1 million of annual contract value. We don't guide or project sales numbers, but internally, we plan to evaluate the sales growth in the fourth quarter not including the large deal. We have approximately 516 salespeople across the company, of that, 220 are U.S. CoStar field reps, which is up from 172 1 year ago, and 128 are Apartment.com field sellers, up from 80 at the same time as the acquisition. Additionally, we have 108 inside sales reps across CoStar, Loop and Apartments, 20 field reps in the U.K. and another 40 across all of our other businesses. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was $99.4 million in the third quarter of 2014 or about 65% of total revenue. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2014, subscription revenue from annual contracts was $373.4 million, up 20% from the 12-month period ended September 30 of 2013, reflecting our continued success in growing the annual subscriptions faster than our other revenue streams. The growth in annual subscription revenue has remained at approximately 20% for the past 5 quarters. This is an important metric for us. Apartments.com revenue for the third quarter of 2014 was $26 million. Through the end of September, we achieved $6.4 million in rev synergies by expanding the presence in market that used to be serviced by the newspapers. As Andy mentioned, our sales force did an outstanding job of converting this opportunity into direct revenue more quickly than expected by the end of the third quarter, and this effort is now largely complete. Our previously published revenue guidance ranges and outlook plan for the successful transition of these markets over 3 or 4 quarters, therefore, we're able to seize this opportunity faster than anticipated, which did help contribute to the strong quarterly results. As we move forward, we'll continue to refine the metrics that we've been providing for the businesses as things change and continue to evolve. Now I'll discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, revenue growth rates, renewal rates, which all may be affected by economic conditions in the commercial real estate market, overall global economy, among other things. Thank you, Jon. We do not attempt to predict foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our guidance assumes little or no volatility at the current rate. Actual results may vary materially from those estimated. And if you can't see that language, just get your magnifying glass. We're providing outlook to reflect our current expectations as of today, October 30, 2014. As I know is a big surprise to everybody, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for 2014 based on strong financial performance through the first 9 months of 2014. This increased revenue outlook incorporates our performance to-date while also accounts for upcoming seasonality in our LoopNet and Apartment businesses, which are typically down in the fourth quarter compared to the third. For the full year 2014, we now expect revenue in the range of $572 million to $574 million, an increase of $5 million at the midpoint of revenue range compared to our previous guidance. We have already begun to reinvest some of our favorable year-to-date earnings to expand the research efforts to support our owner, institutional investor, customer verticals to support Apartments.com and to prepare for expansion into Canadian markets in 2015. We are well underway with this research expansion. Thank you, Frank Carchedi. And as Andy noted, we have over 150 incremental headcount so far, which could expand to 250 to 300 by next year, which will impact cost of revenues and gross margin. We expect the impact of the research investment to be $4 million to $5 million, or $0.07 to $0.09 of non-GAAP net income per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2014, which will translate to approximately $20 million to $25 million in investment for 2015. For the fourth quarter 2014, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of approximately $0.85 to $0.89 based on 32.2 million shares. We are making these investments now, which we believe will drive increased revenue and earnings in 2016, '17 and '18, obviously, helping us to get to our goals. We are now -- we now expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $3.22 to $3.26 based on 30.6 million of diluted shares, an increase of approximately $0.16 at the midpoint compared to the previous published range. This is really a testament to the strength of our business model that we're able to absorb the increased level of investments and still raise our guidance range for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. As discussed with Andy earlier, we are evaluating weather to migrate the LoopNet Marketplace to a pure marketing site where it would be entirely free to search. Similar to the test we have already been running in Florida for the past half month or so, which has had a small revenue impact. The current annual revenue for LoopNet's Premium Searcher and information service is approximately $40 million annually, which consists mostly of monthly contracts. We expect a conversion of the LoopNet Marketplace model throughout 2015 to reduce revenue and earnings in the short term, could be approximately $10 million to $15 million primarily in the first half of 2015, but we remain very confident that these actions will be accretive over time as we expect to convert any of these clients to higher-value, more-profitable annual subscriptions. Essentially, we believe this is a timing and transition process. We are still in the process of building out our detailed budget and operating plan for next year at a high level, but I expect revenue trends to be impacted by the repositioning of LoopNet as well as the full year impact of our decision to discontinue some noncore services at Apartments, which we've discussed. We believe the full year impact of Apartments revenue compared to -- in 2015 will be in the $4 million to $5 million range. Obviously at this point in our budget process, which is really just begun, I'm not yet in the place to publish an external guidance range. But when I look at the current published consensus assessments of approximately 6 70, I don't believe people have factored both of these items into the model, which I plan to in my model. Essentially combines about $14 million to $20 million of lower LoopNet and Apartments revenue in 2015 "in the short term," as we eliminate and reposition certain services, which we believe will ultimately lead to higher revenue in 2016, '17, '18 "in the longer term." But we are still working through our strategy for repositioning of LoopNet, and the financial impact may change. Hopefully, this gives people something to model until I give out a more detailed 2015 guidance in our next earnings call. But I'd also like to make a couple comments about the quarterly timing as we approach the end of the year. As those of you who have followed CoStar for a long time know our earnings are almost always seasonally down in Q1 compared to Q4. I look back 10 years and only twice in that period did the earnings increase quarterly -- sequentially in the first quarter. I don't expect 2015 to be any different. I think in Q1, they'll be down. Our new research investments will continue and could expand in Q1 and other -- also in addition to normal items in Q1 like we do pay raise increases for the entire company. We seasonally have higher payroll taxes, and we have our annual sales conference. Those of you looking ahead should assume a drop in Q1 of earnings of approximately $0.06 to $0.09 in the fourth quarter. This is essentially mechanical. That's what happens every year. In summary, I'm very pleased with CoStar's financial performance for the third quarter of 2014. Our strong cash flow profile is allowing us to continue to invest and grow earnings at the same time. While we finish up with 2014 and plan out 2015, which is shaping up to be an investment year, we continue to believe that the consolidated company is operating in a market of $6 billion to $7 billion revenue opportunity potential, and that the investments we are making in our core research and sales functions will drive accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion in 2016, '17 and '18. I remain confident we can deliver the low to mid-teens revenue growth rates for many years to come needed to achieve our long-term goal of $1 billion in annualized sales in 2018 at a 40-plus percent adjusted EBITDA margin. As always, I look forward to sharing that progress with you these goals in the coming quarters. And now I'll open it up for questions. 12 minutes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First question is regarding the organic growth. Is there a way that you can potentially break that out versus the acquisitions growth for Apartments this quarter and similarly, if you could slice it one more way, maybe the growth for the entire core platform, excluding both LoopNet and Apartment, just so we can understand how those 3 buckets are growing?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. I mean, I think, I basically gave people the exact number. If you included a pro forma of Apartments, year-over-year was 13.9%. Apartments was growing last -- when we bought them at about 10%. Now it's growing at 18%. That's probably higher than normal because some of the conversions that we talked about. But I think in general the entire business is sort of growing in that 12%, 13%, 14%, 15% range with some pieces growing higher and some pieces growing lower than others.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And on the incremental investment spending that you talked about, I know you don't have guidance yet, but how should we think about that spend plus the existing costs both fixed and variable in terms of margins? Again, I know you called out a couple individual line items but just directionally, should we be thinking flattish margins, up or down, just directionally?
Brian J. Radecki: Sir, yes, I mean, I think you can calculate it. I mean, essentially the $20 million to $25 million is all going to be your cost of sales. So, obviously, you can look at sort of what run rate -- where we're at this year. And if you add that for next year, I didn't calculate it, but it's probably a couple percent on gross margin. And then again, once you ramp up the headcount, then you'll have a basically a suppressing of margins for 2 or 3 quarters as we ramp up headcount. And then they should continue to grow again after that. We've already begun that process, so I think we already have 150 people here, and that's really been within the last 3 or 4 weeks. So you'll see that impact in the fourth quarter gross margins. And then it will continue into the first quarter and probably a little bit into the second quarter as we basically fully ramp up the hiring. So I would expect pressure on the gross margin line for 2 quarters possibly 3. And then I think it goes back to sort of as looked at it prior at a growing -- whatever it was growing, up 1%-or-so a quarter.
Andrew C. Florance: And we're also considering some incremental marketing investments to look at the mix that we're addressing. So these are all different factors that would give you that same [ph] result.
Operator: And we'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Brian, I think you've redefined fast talking. Pretty impressive stuff.
Brian J. Radecki: Thank you.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: When I look it kind of -- forgetting the ins and outs and the timing of some of the investments you're making in some of the product transitions that you're talking about, Andy, you talked about this sales force productivity platform combined with new products and the combination of CoStar Suite and Analytics, I guess. When I think about the sales force productivity, which is ramping, and the power of a single sign-on, as we move past this sort of products we transition that's taking place at LoopNet and Apartments and you think about the sales force becoming more productive, is it reasonable to think that as we head into '16 perhaps, the organic revenue growth could even accelerate beyond the mid-teens level that you're seeing today sort of despite these moving pieces?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. I feel very good about all these pieces coming together. Obviously, they're coming together in a pretty large scale, but there is a very nice dovetail between debt and equity, Apartments.com products, both in marketing and information, and traditional business. One of the nice things about Apartments.com is it's giving us additional scale in order to justify a deeper, stronger footprint at the local level, and it gives us additional relationships into people that may own a series of apartment buildings in Richmond, Virginia, but they also own some office buildings, just in recent retail properties. So it's just increasing the scale of our distribution channel, and they're all interconnected. Very little of it's disconnected. So it's -- and in particular, when you look at things like the LoopNet customer base for information was historically stronger in areas where we didn't have as much scale and we didn't have as active a field sales force. With the merger with Apartments.com, we are building a much stronger combined sales force down into tertiary markets and secondary markets in the United States, which are still huge markets. So it's a lot of work to put these pieces together, and you do get some frictional bumps here and there as you should do it. But it looks very, very positive for the story that you'll be able to -- we hope we'll be able to communicate in 2015 will be directionally clear that could lead to something more impressive than the teens.
Brian J. Radecki: And just to add onto that the, so -- I mean, clearly, we're -- there's a lot of moving pieces in '15. It's an investment year and sort of a pivotal year with a lot of pieces moving. So I think we both believe '16 growth rates can be higher. The only thing I would just caution everybody on, and I hate to always be the guy to say that, that we plan on growing and accelerating growth and through the sales force and all the initiatives that we're doing, but remember, you lose about 1.5% to 2% every year at the size that we're at. So we 100% have to generate more and more dollars from all these products and services in order to continue to maintain and be in that 12%, 13%, 14%, 15% range. So I agree with what Andy said, I just want to add that there's a mechanical modeling thing that you have to just be aware of.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Are there any sales force sort of characteristics, individual salesperson characteristics or skill sets that you think you need as the business transitions that you don't have already in house?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, for sure. I mean, the people we've got, there are -- as we grow, there are a number of very diverse roles within our sales force. So like in a Washington, D.C., you've got farmers who are dealing with our major-market customers. So we have 150 customers represent a disproportionate amount of our revenue in Washington. So it's farmer customers, their ability to maintain those relationships. We have debt and equity farmers, debt and equity hunters. We've got -- now we've got the general sales force dealing with the core of the business and then Apartments.com, farmers and apartments.com hunters and management levels in there. So we are able to find lots of good homes for the salespeople we've got. The kinds of things we're looking to probably build are management roles with that sort of thing we love to find where someone is good at selling lead generation and information or at marketing and information. The good news is that over 100 of our traditionally information-focused salespeople on the CoStar side have proven their ability to sell significant amounts of advertising revenue in the past year. So we're getting a sales force now that can really be multifunction, play multiple roles, bat left or bat right. So it's an important thing. We're definitely, definitely tweaking it, structuring it and looking for some new slots. We're very happy with the core we have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Sara Gubins with BoA Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It was a very solid net new sales number. But I'm wondering what LoopNet sales were like during the quarter given 25% growth and core CoStar?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. So the LoopNet sort of an annual contract sales were down a little bit compared to last year. Prior to that could be some of the things that we're tweaking. We are tinkering with it and testing various things, which I think we talked about pretty extensively on the call. So we are looking to transition LoopNet to a pure marketing solution. So I think that will probably have some impact for the next few quarters. But I think, overall, very strong quarter overall for the sales group and, obviously, for the core CoStar.
Andrew C. Florance: We also have minor impact from significantly increasing our credit card security level. And then -- which caused credit card expiration changes and the like in our billing, which had some temporary impacts. But the net -- it's a net positive because we dramatically increased our security level on [ph] credit cards.
Brian J. Radecki: And I think -- and one more thing that just come to mind, Sara, which I think we've talk about prior is that as you take an entire contract base of $80 million or $100 million or whatever it was when we bought it, which there was no annual contracts and will -- in the longer term go through a similar thing with Apartments, and you start successfully moving them onto annual contracts, that's a huge deal to have somebody renew on the annual contracts. But what that does happen is as you start getting to the bulk of them, where now we're at 40%, 50% of them is, as you start getting even at a 90% renewal rate, you start getting those cancels in there, which will affect that sort of -- some of those numbers. So again, I think, all positives. I think things are all moving in the right direction. We're really happy with it, but there's 2 or 3 things that I think affect it.
Andrew C. Florance: And when you're feeling that things are pretty solid, we are making some choices to do some things that are the right decision for 9 months out but are not the right decision for this month.
Operator: And we'll go next to Brandon Dobell with William Blair.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I guess, given where the kind of the implied EBITDA for next year would go, if we would build into the model, the lower revenues like you talked about, Brian, and the spending, the implication is the ramp exiting '15 towards the 40% margin is a -- I wouldn't call it a vertical -- straight up vertical, but it's going to be pretty close to get from where we're going to finish the year to that 40% run rate by the end of '18. Maybe some color on how we think about the -- you're guys confidence in hitting that ramp or the drivers for what should be and then the incremental margins that probably have to be in the 80s or 90s to get from the exit of '15 up to '18, 40% EBITDA margins?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure. Yes, I have a lot of confidence, Brandon. And I think if people want to know the price, you brand it?
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Not really, no.
Brian J. Radecki: If people want to know why, just look at the past 2 or 3 years. So it's funny. We talk about dropping $0.70 to $0.80 in the bottom line and for the past 2 or 3 years, people keep telling me it's been 100% to 110%. So I think if you look at the past 2 or 3 years and even though 2015 is turning out to be an investment year, I think if you look at the ramp the last 2 or 3 years, it will show you that you can get there by 2018, I think, very confidently. The investments that we're making are core investments in areas where we have so much experience. I mean, I've been here going on 18 years. Andy has been doing this 25 years or maybe even longer. He's getting mad because I'm not giving him credit, okay, 30 years. No, I'm sorry, 40 years, he was doing this when he was in grade school. So like going into Canada, obviously, is a decision that we need to do. But like -- we've been expanding in the markets time and time again. Look at the success all across the U.S. Look at the success in the U.K. So we have tons of models on this. I mean, we're -- I just -- I have an awful lot of confidence because a lot of the investments are going into places that we know, we know very well, and we model very well, and I have a lot of confidence in having the ability. I think the core model can drop $0.70, $0.80 to the bottom line. Obviously, we can tweak levers very easily to make it even higher at different points. So I think making the investments in '15 really sets us up really, really well for '16, '17 and '18. I feel good [ph].
Andrew C. Florance: And we have the ability to clearly communicate what's happening throughout the year in 2015. And I would -- you've been watching this company for a while, and there are multiple cases where you make an incremental investment in some researchers and then you come out of it. And I was always surprised at that trajectory. And for example, when you look at the United Kingdom this quarter, revenue growing 22% in the first 9 months of '14 and EBITDA at $1.9 million in the first 9 months compared to negative $3.9 million in the same period in 2013. So that's the kind of -- after you've made some of those investments, you get this sort of slingshot effect.
Brian J. Radecki: Hockey shot. Hockey is coming out of him.
Andrew C. Florance: So the slingshot is exactly what we're going for. [indiscernible] impact. Just fire it up.
Operator: We'll go next to Phil Stiller with Citi.
Philip Stiller - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess I wanted to ask about the sales force. Obviously, nice to see the year-over-year comp turn positive here in the third quarter, and I know you're not giving guidance on this and there's a comp issue in the fourth quarter, but maybe, I guess, you could share kind of what your longer-term expectations are for eventual bookings growth once the sales force matures? And also perhaps you could share what the turnover has been given the amount of hiring you've done over the past 18 months.
Andrew C. Florance: Do you have specific turnover numbers?
Brian J. Radecki: I can do anecdotal. Yes, I mean, I think it's been pretty good. I think it's actually -- it's sort of about where we were modeling, somewhat lower, I think, for the newer group you're sort of in the 30% to 40% range. I think the groups that have been there for over a couple years continues to be in the sub-20s. So I don't think -- from our models, and I know we talked about this in the past, I think the turnover is pretty consistent to what we were expecting. And as far as like -- we don't really guide on it, but I think we've talked about this. When you hire that many people, it's not that you drop another 150 people in 1 month and then they all mature at 1 month. They come in at 20 per class, 15, 20, 25 per class over months and months and months, and therefore, they mature over months and months and months really over like 1 year. And then if you lose 30% to 40% the first shot round and then you eventually get that next round 20%. Then you're sort of backfilling again. So it's really a 2- or 3-year process when you do this. And so my expectation, and then Andy can talk about his expectation, is that, obviously, you would have solid bookings growth really throughout the year. Like, I don't expect a big spike up or a big spike down. I think it's going to be pretty consistent throughout the year. And Andy, I don't know if you want to add to that.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes. And so my impression is that our turnover rates are better than the longer-term averages right now, especially where it matters the most, which is the experienced salespeople. The -- I anticipate getting a significant increase in productivity on the Apartments.com side. So I can look at -- and you can see that in the sales -- in the unit production numbers I just gave you. So when you look at what they were doing last year, what they're doing now, we're seeing a continuous trend of productivity improvement there. I am, again, very excited about being able to build a much stronger, deeper sales force by being able to link up some of the work the Apartments folks are doing with what the CoStar folks are doing and layering in a much stronger debt and equity component. So these are -- will be moving towards some higher-dollar sales numbers. And so I like those trends, and I think that gives you upward pressure on productivity. Also, as we consider ways to discontinue lower new low-priced information products with lots of buy it for 4 months, turn it off for a month, buy it for 4 months, turn it off. When you discontinue those sorts of products and move people into higher-value longer-term products, that would also feed our sales force with a huge volume of highly qualified leads. So that also drives productivity up. So there's some heavy lifting to do culturally and strategically with merging together these 2 large sales forces, but I believe that we'll have that done by mid next year, and they'll be really hitting some high productivity.
Operator: And we'll go to Brett Huff with Stephens.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Two questions -- or actually 3 quick questions from me. One is how should we think about your -- before you had given kind of a '16 -- 2016 goal, I think you were recalling it. Are we now just using the '18 -- 2018 goal? Is that the focus at this point?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean, I think that after the Apartments acquisition, we just sort of set the '18 goal out there, which everybody can calculate sort of the CAGR, and it's a fairly reasonable CAGR, compound annual growth rate, in the low to mid-teens between now and then. So I think we feel pretty confident about the 2018 goal.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then of the spending, at least the way I understood on the -- in the press release last night, was that the $20 million to $25 million would include researchers, Apartments.com spend and then some more accelerated debt and equity sales folks. It sounds like the -- based on what I'm hearing today on the call is that it sounds like it's mostly researchers. But if there's other stuff in there, can you give us a little sense -- Andy, I think you maybe you mentioned some advertising, and if it's Apartments.com, is it advertising? Or is it more website work or whatever? Because I think folks are asking us about the level of advertising spend needed for Apartments.
Brian J. Radecki: I'll start it and Andy can jump in. So the majority of it's research. We're going to add probably 300 researchers so people can calculate that. We're also in Canada, expanding across Canada. There's some governmental datasets and some other things that are very expensive that we need to get. So I would say the vast majority of that is research. And so whether it's research for debt and equity or research in Canada, it's sort of spread across all those would be the majority of it.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, and there is some increase in sales, not it's more filling in infrastructure and a lot of the debt and equity roles will be filled by existing salespeople, I think, will perform fantastically in those roles. It's more filling in management infrastructure, some player coach roles and smaller team size and more markets. It might include more field sales offices. It would include some marketings -- incremental marketing spend, which we're continuing to evaluate right now what the right level is. Software is going up slightly, but we're really doing it with the team that we have with Apartments.com and with existing LoopNet, CoStar teams, are, I think, doing a great job at handling the workload right now and turning in a great performance. So it's a little bit. But -- that's what we're thinking about it.
Operator: And we'll go to Michael Huang with Needham.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So just a question on Apartments.com. I mean, great to see that you signed up more communities, but I was wondering if you can share with us how the size of these communities are comparing with those that were being acquired in the past. I mean, obviously, you've seen some gross in units [indiscernible] I was just wanting to find out whether or not they're apples-to-apples. And then with respect to the progress on selling CoStar information into back into the Apartments' customer base, I was wondering if you could give an update on that.
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. So the accounts we're signing up now are basically identical to the accounts we've been signing up historically, so it feels very similar. And they tend to be in communities that are 120 units or larger. In 2015, we're going to expand our efforts to work the whole spectrum from 20 units plus with some various product offerings. So it feels very similar in apples-to-apples. The -- there is progress occurring on selling information into the Apartments.com audience. It does seem like every single meeting I have with any prospective client for Apartments.com advertising turns the conversation to information pretty quickly. So there seems to be clear demand from my experience, and I've actually gone into some small apartment owner-developers in some small cities, and I keep running into the fact that someone else from the office has just bought CoStar Property and I was there to see them about Apartments.com. So it appears to be working, and we're lining up, frankly, we're doing this, we're lining up a significant launch effort in the first part of next year. So we're trying to sort through a concerted push with some significant improvements to CoStar property in 2015. So we're not -- I'm holding off pushing the sales force aggressively into that space until the first quarter, until we can give them a couple more tools in the toolkit and get them fired up about it.
Operator: And we'll go to Peter Lowry with JMP Securities.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: One quick question. Have your outlook and expectations for the performance of the debt equity team increased since last quarter? Or are they just meeting high expectations?
Andrew C. Florance: I would say expectations are definitely increasing across the board: U.K., Canada, U.S. Definitely increasing. For all the salespeople out there listening every single time we hit a number, the expectation always goes up.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: That's okay. Co-commissions.
Andrew C. Florance: Exactly. Yes, so it feels like it's just a really solid area for us.
Operator: We have a question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So I got a couple of questions for you. The first was just to doublecheck the organic growth calculation. It's looked like -- if you gave us pro forma of 13.9%, I just want to make sure I'm using the right level for Apartments.com, historically. It looks like about 22%, 22.1%, and that would put you right about 26%, 26.1% for...
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I think you're close. I don't know the exact number, but the exact calculation is 13.9%, so you can back into that, so it's like 22.5% or something like or 22.4% on a pro forma basis for them last year.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Right. And then that would imply for CoStar without Apartments growing at about 13%, 13.1%. Does that sound about right?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I think, it's somewhere around there, plus or minus.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And Andy, for the EBITDA margin, 2014 -- 2015 versus 2014, are we thinking that, that margin is likely to be flat, up some? I'm just trying to get a sense directionally whether we can expect...
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. I mean, I think -- I mean, I'll try to simplify it. I mean, I didn't -- I'm not really coming out with guidance right now. I mean, the reality is we just started a -- I mean, I'll give you some commentary. The reality is we literally just started the detailed budget and operating plan process, which will be presented to our board in December. So it's kind of I don't really want to get out there. And obviously, when you look at all the projects, there's a lot of moving parts, there's a lot of things we're testing and analyzing or hiring researchers. So there's a lot going on here as most people know and expect. So I mean, I'm not really prepared to give a goal. My just [ph] view is that -- I mean, obviously with everything going on 2015 is sort of an investment year. I really think it sets up '16, '17 '18 really, really well. I tried to give people some of the pieces. I mean, obviously, you guys didn't have $20 million to $25 million investments into mainly research in the model. I don't think people were expecting us to expand to Canada. Obviously, we took this opportunity to make that decision. So what I would do is just go through, and I'd sort of look at sort of -- again, whatever your models, the consensus models, and I would just make sure that you're adding in these new things that we've talked about. And I don't know what that adds up to because I haven't actually -- like I said, I'm just going through the process now. Obviously, there's going to be more investments next year than people -- than we're talking about prior. But I think it sets us up very, very nicely. The stuff with for LoopNet, I mean, obviously, we're -- that could very -- is to what could happen there. But I view that as sort of a transition process sort of an in and out. What will impact us in '15 will come back to us by the time we get to '16, '17, '18. So really, the more permanent cost structure will be the research, and again, I feel great about that because we've been doing this for a long time. We've entered a lot of cities, and we got a lot of confidence, and we know we'll be making a lot of money come a few years down the road.
Andrew C. Florance: And I do have to say that all these decisions, right now, when you look at how the company feels right now, I feel like we have never had a stronger capability in the teams, albeit systems, research, economics, sales, finance, all different components are incredibly strong right now, and the opportunities are significant, and the cohesiveness is good. So I feel like we have a very strong engine and some tailwinds, so we're running it flat out, frankly. And so we're just running every single element. But I really like the get 2-for-1 sort of efficiencies we're getting. So that when you're pursuing a revenue opportunity in the apartment space, you are, for free, driving a revenue opportunity in the information space in the debt and equity side. So we're basically, that's where we're pursuing it, and the decisions that, obviously, for competitive reasons, we can't discuss every single detail and because we're still formulating the budget, making some decisions, you can't formulate every single -- you can't discuss every single decision. But I'll tell you that the decisions are not difficult to make. They're clear. So we feel pretty good about it right now.
Operator: And I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing comments.
Andrew C. Florance: Well, I definitely appreciate everyone joining us on the call. I apologize for the friction between Brian and Jon. I'll take them to lunch, try to work it out. But another great quarter, and congrats to the team.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] So without further ado, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy?
Andrew C. Florance: Thank you, Rich. I guess that 1-question rule is to help my feeble mind keep each question in mind. Compound questions, too complicated. Okay. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our team's performance over the first half of 2014. Revenue for the second quarter of 2014 was $148 million, which is an increase of approximately 36% over the second quarter of 2013. For the same period, EBITDA was $38 million, up 49% year-over-year. In the second quarter 2014, we achieved net new sales subscription services on annual contracts of approximately $16 million, which is an increase of 9.2% over the first quarter 2014 and is basically in line with the same quarter prior, which was a phenomenal record quarter for us. The core CoStar product lines show accelerating sales growth, achieving $9.7 million in the second quarter, which is up 17% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year. In May 2014, we recorded our all-time highest net new sales month. Through the first half of the year, we have added over $30 million of annualized net new sales on our annual subscription business. Our annual subscription businesses continue to enjoy a very high renewal rate of over 92%. During the quarter, we raised $529 million in net proceeds from our successful equity offering, had a chance to visit with a number of you, and we intend to use that for investment purposes, general capital and continued growth of the company and to better position ourselves for potential strategic acquisitions. I'll take a moment to comment on the commercial real estate market economics right now that we're operating in. The recovery continues to improve and is showing signs of strengthening. For the most part, we're enjoying a healthy operating environment in commercial real estate. Investor demand for U.S. real estate remains healthy. Liquidity is strong, with year-over-year sales up 10% from 1 year ago. Trading volume is now well above historical averages and nearly back to 2007 peaks. For our brokerage clients, this means commission levels are high, which is a positive for CoStar's revenue growth. Construction remains focused on a handful of markets. Demand growth is strong enough to heal fundamentals but not strong enough to lure developers back into market in mass with aggressive building. Specifically, new construction inventory is about half the pace of demand, and the supply growth is 20% to 40% of what occurred from 2006 to 2008, so it's a very quiet construction environment. Office market fundamentals are improving at a steady pace. National vacancies have fallen steadily for 4 years straight and are closely aligned with 2005 levels and long-term averages. Net absorptions surpassed 75 million square feet for the past 12 months, ending the second quarter at 20 million square feet for the second quarter 2014. This was the largest annualized increase in 6 years. Industrial market fundamentals are the tightest they've been since 2001, with a 7.2% vacancy rate; while the retail market is returning to normal, with vacancies back in line with long-term averages, while rents and incomes are growing. Apartment market performance was solid in the second quarter as millennials have helped to absorb newly built units. A total of 202,000 apartment units have been added to the market stock over the past year, up a very significant 60% from 1 year earlier. Despite the surge in construction, net absorption at 173,000 units was only 30,000 units short of completions and is nearly unchanged from a year earlier. Since the market-cycle low in 2013, vacancy has risen by 20 basis points to 5.4%. So while supplies picked up, apartment fundamentals of supply, demand and rent are benefiting from housing trends that favor renting. I believe the strong leasing activity and slightly increased vacancy is creating good tailwinds for our apartments' products. Now I'll take a moment to update you on LoopNet. Our LoopNet marketplace continues to show vibrant growth, with 44.2 million profile views in the quarter, excluding bots [ph], and that's up 18% year-over-year. LoopNet marketplace revenues for the second quarter 2014 were $27.5 million, growing 6.2% over the first quarter of 2014, so really good growth there. The LoopNet Premium Membership revenue grew approximately 20% in the second quarter over the prior year. Migrating clients from month-to-month contracts to annual subscriptions remains a priority, and we are achieving great results with LoopNet annual subscription revenue growing 148% year-over-year to $41.3 million annualized in the second quarter. We continue to make very good progress increasing our average revenue per LoopNet customer. Average revenue per premium member climbed 18% to $86.34 in the second quarter 2014 compared to $72.90 the prior year. Average revenue per Premium Lister grew 14% year-over-year to $101.74 in the second quarter. We continue to pursue what we believe is a huge opportunity to sell CoStar information solutions to nearly 100,000 higher potential prospects that use LoopNet for information rather than just using it for marketing. We have now raised the entry price for a single-user upgrade from LoopNet information to CoStar information from $29 per month to $395 per month. When we closed the LoopNet deal in April 2012, only 31% of listings on LoopNet were paid, and the remainder were free listings. We have made it a priority to increase our monetization of those free listings. We have succeeded, and 50% of the listings on the site are now paid. We have 278,200 paid listings, up 26% year-over-year and up 65% since closing the merger in April 2012, when we only had 168,400 paid listings. While we've made a lot of good progress, we believe we have significant additional revenue potential in the 587,000 listings in the CoStar database that are not yet advertised or paid on LoopNet. In addition, we have significant additional potential to monetize various enhanced listing opportunities throughout the site. Our sale of spotlight ads has proven to be very successful. We plan to continue to add new levels and areas of placement and larger ad sizes for our advertisers who need additional exposure for the listings and are willing to pay a premium for it. Now I want to turn to give you an update on the first quarter of operating Apartments.com. So as you know, in the second quarter 2014, we closed our acquisition of Apartments.com, one of the leading Internet apartment marketplaces. We have moved very quickly with real focus and are well ahead of planned schedule, having already achieved several key goals. We've achieved $5.2 million in revenue synergies by converting 2,700 clients from indirect wholesale purchases to direct sales. Prior to our acquisition of Apartments.com, newspapers owned by Apartments.com owners in certain cities purchased advertising exposure on Apartments.com and used their sales force to retail it directly. So newspaper sales forces were selling space on Apartments.com. Upon closing the acquisition, we made it our top priority to add 40 salespeople into these indirect sales markets and convert them from wholesale to direct sales with Apartments.com. Typically, Apartments.com would receive $130 per month for an apartment community advertised at wholesale price and $445 per month for apartment communities advertised directly. This conversion from wholesale to direct sales had a very significant impact, driving an overall 15% increase in our average revenue per apartment community. And that's across all the apartments being marketed on our site, not just the ones converting from wholesale to direct. This allowed us to already achieve approximately $5 million in contracted revenue and approximately $875,000 in monthly sales post-acquisition. Wow. We believe we have already significantly improved the Apartment.com website. We improved the mapping capabilities. We have cleaned and simplified the look and feel and increased the professional presence of the advertised communities. We have eliminated unrelated banner advertising on the site, which we believe cheapened the presentation of our advertisers' properties. This meant foregoing approximately $3 million dollars in annualized revenue, but we believe that investment will pay off in the short term. We achieved a much higher growth rate in the quarter for Apartments.com despite terminating banner revenue. We have also significantly increased our investment in search engine marketing. We believe that all these improvements have resulted in a 27% quarter-over-quarter increase in leads generated for our clients, which delivers more value to our clients. As with LoopNet, we have quickly accelerated revenue growth at Apartment.com post-acquisition, and we're not done. In the second quarter 2014, Apartments.com revenue growth accelerated from growing 11% year-over-year to 15.7% year-over-year at the end of the second quarter. We will continue to make important incremental improvements to the Apartments' website, but we also completed a comprehensive new product design for the next-generation Apartments.com's website. That next-generation product is now in our software development team's hands, and work is well underway on building a new product offering that we believe will be an industry game-changer that will enable us to take significant new market share. I'm very appreciative of the fantastic job Brad Long, President of Apartments.com, and his team have done in coming out of the gate so quickly and focusing intensely on successfully converting these thousands of customers from wholesale to retail, thereby driving this revenue surge. I have strong confidence in Brad's sales leadership as we move forward. We're very pleased with our continued strong results in both the United Kingdom and Toronto, Canada. CoStar in the United Kingdom had our highest-ever sales result in the second quarter 2014, coming in 32% higher, when measured in British pounds, than the same quarter in the prior year. Our sales results in the U.K. have now accelerated to a level that matches the U.S. sales levels on a pro rata GDP basis, which has been a long-term goal of mine. CoStar Suite growth is strong. It is becoming the single largest revenue stream in the United Kingdom, surpassing our legacy-focused product in monthly revenue in the month of June. We have now signed 600 U.K. clients to CoStar Suite in 600 days. Half of the 8 major U.K. brokerage firms have now upgraded to the benefits CoStar Suite offer. After a period of investment, the U.K. business has now achieved positive EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, with $1.1 million EBITDA year-to-date. We believe the U.K. will continue to stay positive going forward, and we know Matt Green will watch the costs. I could not be more pleased with the good work Giles Newman and his team are doing in Europe. In Toronto, Canada, we continue to sign on additional brokers, investment companies and owners. We now have more than a dozen leading Canadian companies subscribed into our flagship product, CoStar Suite, and we have a phenomenal sales team up there to exploit that opportunity. Give you a little bit of an update on sales. I think a couple of you are interested in sales force growth and productivity. Now let's get that -- no, okay, let's do that. We believe that the addressable market for commercial real estate information and analytics in the U.S. is in the billions of dollars and that we have penetrated only a fraction of that opportunity today. In order to better and more quickly address the market, we have made significant investments in growing our sales force over the past 3 quarters. We now have approximately 500 salespeople on staff. The most dramatic organic growth in that sales force is in our U.S. CoStar LoopNet field sales team, where we've added 75 net new sales people over the past year for an increase of 50%. We know from experience that when you grow a sales force dramatically, per sales person productivity drops significantly across the sales force as these new salespeople ramp up. We have not expected to see significant revenue growth gains from that sales force into the later half of this year. The first part of the process is all about investing and work. We have approximately 99 U.S. CoStar LoopNet field salespeople with 1 year or less of experience. On a rolling 3-month average, they're averaging $196,800 in annualized gross sales. We have 118 experienced U.S. CoStar LoopNet field salespeople with more than 1 year experience. In contrast, they're averaging $422,640 in annualized gross sales on a 3-month trailing basis. That's 114% more. The experienced people are selling 114% more than the inexperienced sales reps, and that's not a surprise to us at this point. It's also important to note that your cancellation level is roughly fixed, so your gross production is more dramatic of a difference. So the first half, what a salesperson sells is pretty much there and it's pretty much past the cancels. So as you climb in productivity, you have a leveraged increase in net production. Anecdotally, I noticed on today's metric report that 4 sales reps, Maxx Mantooth, Brett Reed, Charles Tappen and Keith Wells just reached their first anniversary in our sales force, and they are now averaging $337,700 in annualized production. Congratulations to these guys on their strong performance. Of course, we also have some rookies who are hitting home runs and maybe even grand slams on their first at-bats. Thomas Valenzuela has a financial sales background and has been selling debt and equity solutions for us in Orange County for less than a year. On a 3-month trailing basis, he has sold, on an annualized basis, $986,000 in new business. Just as some of these new salespeople are making positive contributions to our sales team, so too are some of our new managers making a big difference; John Toomey joined us less than a year ago. He has a background in commercial real estate and software sales. When he joined us, his region was at 42% of target. For the past 2 months in a row, he now has that region to 104% of target. In order to help us achieve our target productivity gains across our larger sales force, we've made an important leadership change to the top of the sales organization. Max Linnington has joined us as Executive Vice President of Sales. While leading North American sales for Bloomberg, Max demonstrated his ability to create a culture of success and accountability across a 700-person sales organization. He is now responsible for leading all of our North American sales operations, including the sales team of all CoStar, LoopNet, Apartments.com and our Marketplace Verticals and one of my favorites, Lands of America. Max's expertise in selling services at the institutional level will be extremely valuable as we develop an even better strategy for penetrating lucrative verticals such as banks, institutional investors and owners. As we begin to stabilize the sales force with the new larger size, we're happy to have found some very valuable new additions to the team. We're also realistic about those salespeople and managers who have not reached our expectations, and will continue to upgrade in those positions until we reach our historical productivity levels at a larger-scale team. Finally, I'd like to update you on our successes -- recent successes, really strong successes at CoStar Real Estate Manager. In particular, since I'm in the Atlanta office today and I'll be talking to that team later, I really want to give them good kudos. Subscription revenue for CoStar Real Estate Manager grew by over 22% in the first half of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. Formerly known as Virtual Premise, CoStar Real Estate Manager had its highest-ever level of net new sales for Q2 2014 since we acquired the company in October 2011. The team is doing a fantastic job, and they're a pleasure to work with. Some significant new client wins in the quarter include American Airlines, Stanley Black & Decker and Schlage Lock Company. United Parcel Service also extended and expanded their client relationship with us, so a lot of exciting things happening there. I'm very excited about the prospects for the rest of this year and beyond for CoStar. Revenue, EBITDA and sales are strong, and we've made investments that we expect will continue to see us move towards our goal of becoming a $1 billion revenue company with 40%-plus margins in 2018. We're going to take a brief 15-minute intermission before I begin the second half of my presentation. No, just joking. I'm going to go ahead and turn the call over to Brian Radecki. Brian, we've used up all our jokes.
Brian J. Radecki: Thanks, Andy. And thank you again to Andy Thomas and his team out here doing a great job for allowing us to borrow their conference room. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the second quarter of 2014. CoStar's organic business continues to show strong growth, while EBITDA margins continue to expand. Second quarter 2014 is the first quarter to include financial results with Apartments.com's numbers, which closed on April 1, 2014. We're making great progress integrating Apartments.com into our existing business while continuing to pursue growth drivers in our core business through sales force staffing and productivity, as well as ongoing product development efforts. Now let's get started with CoStar Group's results for the second quarter of 2014. The company reported $147.7 million of revenue, an increase of approximately 36% compared to $109 million revenue in the second quarter of 2013. This growth was driven by strong information services performance and from strong growth across all of our marketplaces, including LoopNet.com and Apartments.com. On a pro forma basis, our year-over-year revenue growth was 13.5% for the year-to-date 2014 compared to pro forma 2013 adjusted to include Apartments.com's revenue; therefore operating in the 12% to 15% revenue growth range. EBITDA increased from 12.3% to -- $12.3 million to $37.6 million in the second quarter of 2014, up from $25 million or 49% in Q2 of last year. Also, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $45.3 million in the second quarter, which is an increase of $12.7 million or approximately 39% compared to the second quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 30.7% in Q2 of 2014, again, up from last year. Non-GAAP net income in Q2 of 2014 was $23.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share, which is a 37% increase from the second quarter of 2013. Gross margin was $108.2 million for the quarter or 73.3% of our revenue. This is an increase from approximately 70% in Q2 of 2013, reflecting the continued strength in growth of our business model. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms, in our press release issued yesterday and are available at our newly re-rated website at www.costargroup.com. Stay tuned. Cash and investments was $466.5 million at June 30, 2014, and short- and long-term debt totaled $395 million as of June 30, 2014. We had a lot of movement in our capital structure during the quarter. To fund the $585 million acquisition of Apartments, we entered into a credit agreement that provided $400 million term loan facility and a $225 million revolving credit facility. We initially drew $150 million under the revolver and then subsequently repaid that amount. Additionally, we issued 3.45 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $529.4 million. Therefore, we currently have access to the $466.5 million of cash and investments, along with the $225 million revolving credit facility, that are available to fund future potential strategic acquisitions, to finance the growth of our business or working capital or other general corporate purposes. At this point, I'm going to give some additional color on a few metrics to highlight our strong performance in the second quarter. We achieved $16 million in net new sales of subscription services on annual contracts in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of our ongoing success driving sales information, analytics, services, marketplaces, lead generation, cross-sell with LoopNet, you name it. To be clear, the sales metric is consistent with what we reported in recent quarters and does not include sales from Apartments.com, so it's a consistent metric. Apartment.com's standard contracts have annual terms that have cancellation rights after 6 months; therefore, we do not include them in the annual subscription sales metric. The $16 million is on par with our highest sales result in the company's history in the second quarter of 2013. We are pleased with this result, in light of all the changes we made late in 2013 and the first half of 2014, including the increase in sales headcount, as well as the change in leadership at the top of our organization. For those investors who are new to CoStar and our metrics, I want to be clear that our net new sales metric reflects incremental future revenue. Flat net new sales does not mean flat revenue; every dollar of net new sales grows our subscription revenue base. In prior calls, Andy and I spoke at length about the great progress we're making expanding the sales force and our roadmap for moving these reps up the productivity curve. Maturing the sales force will take time, but we believe it will keep delivering upside over the next few years. As we've previously stated, we expect to begin seeing the productivity increases later this year and all throughout 2015, so 2016 will be sort of full impact. Remember that half the sales force is new and learning from the other half with experience. It takes time and energy for the whole sales force. As Andy noted earlier, we have approximately 500 total salespeople across the company. Of that total, 215 are in the U.S. CoStar field sales reps, which would be up from the 140 we had reported a year ago, and 123 at Apartments.com field sellers, up from 80 -- approximately 80 at the time of the acquisition. Additionally, we have about 100 inside sales reps across CoStar, Loop and Apartments, 22 in the U.K. and about 40 across our other market verticals and businesses. Revenue from subscription services of annual contracts was $95.4 million in the second quarter of 2014 or 64.6% of our total revenues, including Apartments. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30, subscription revenues from annual contracts totaled $357.8 million, up 21% from $296.4 million for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2013. If we look at the pre-Apartments business, subscription revenue on annual contracts would have comprised 78% of total revenue, up from 71% right after the LoopNet acquisition, reflecting the solid growth in the annual subscriptions. Just like with LoopNet, our long-term goal is to move as many clients from all of our services and marketplaces over to annual agreements over time. The renewal rates for annual subscription remained very high during the quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar subscription services was 92% in the second quarter. As we've discussed the last few quarters, the introduction of more annual contracts across LoopNet and our subscription base is expected to cause the 12-month renewal rate to edge down slightly, possibly 1% or 2%, over the next year or so. The renewal rate for CoStar subscribers who've been with us for 5 years or longer was approximately 98%, which remains phenomenally high and consistent with prior quarters. As noted in our press release, and Andy stated, revenue from LoopNet marketplace was about $27.5 million in the second quarter of 2014, which represents all the services available at loopnet.com but does not include revenue from the other businesses that came along with it, like the market verticals, if you're trying to figure that out. Since the Apartment business does not conform to our annual subscription revenue metrics we provide historically, I'd like to give some insight on how the business performed in the quarter. Apartments.com revenue for Q2 2014 was $25 million. Since the acquisition, we made a strong push, as Andy said, to expand the apartment sales force, and we successfully added 40 new sales reps to their field sales force, so that's a 50% increase, again, for them. So they've also got significantly new staff. This staffing allowed us to achieve the $5.2 million in revenue synergies by expanding our presence in the markets that used to be serviced by the newspapers that previously owned Apartments.com. And as Andy stated, we converted 2,700 apartment communities from indirect wholesale purchases to direct. Our previously published revenue ranges outlook planned for the successful transition of these markets over 3 or 4 quarters, therefore, we're able to see this opportunity faster than anticipated, which helped contribute to our strong quarterly results. We've also achieved approximately $5 million in annualized cost synergies so far. As we suggested at the time of the deal, we believe we can realize $20 million of annual synergies over 24 months following the deal, and we are already halfway to that goal after just 3 months. During the quarter, we started to implement product enhances at Apartments.com aiming to improve the consumer experience, as Andy mentioned, which is expected to have short-term impact on the revenue results as we discontinue non-core revenue-producing services. We've already eliminated banner ads from the website and we're moving forward with other strategies that are expected to make the site easier to navigate and more appealing to consumers that visit in search of a new apartment. The impact of eliminating these revenue-generating non-core offerings, as I stated last time, is approximately $2 million to $3 million in 2014, with a $4 million to $5 million potential run rate going into 2015. As we move forward, we'll relook at these metrics that we currently provide in order to make sure we give appropriate insight into the newly acquired Apartments' marketplace as we gain more information. Now I'll discuss my outlook for the third quarter and full year 2014. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, revenue growth, revenue renewal rates, which all may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate or the overall global economy, among other things. Our guidance on the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at our top line results remain consistent. We do not attempt to predict foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and our guidance assumes a little or no volatility for the current rate. Actual results may vary from these estimates. If you're feeling dizzy or lightheaded right now, call your doctor or Jon Coleman at (301) 452-4673. Again, Jon Coleman at (301) 452-4673. We're providing our outlook reflecting our current expectations as of today, July 24, 2014. Based on strong revenue and earnings results in the second quarter, we are raising both our revenue and earnings guidance outlook for the year. For the full year 2014, we now expect consolidated revenue of approximately $565 million to $571 million, which is an increase of $3 million at the midpoint of the revenue range compared to our previous guidance. This revenue range considers our sales performance to date, synergies at Apartments and fourth quarter seasonality, which will be associated with both LoopNet and Apartments' marketplaces, along with the elimination of some of the services we discussed at Apartments. Apartments -- people who used to track LoopNet will remember they had some tough Q4s. The Apartments business, very similar without annual contracts in the fourth quarter, so we've accounted for that. We expect revenue in the third quarter of 2014 in the range of $149 million to $151 million. As I mentioned earlier, we issued an additional 3.45 million shares in our June follow-on offering, which resulted in a reduction of our non-GAAP EPS of about $0.20 for 2014. We now expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $3.05 to $3.10 for the full year 2014 based on 30.7 million shares. This represents an increase of $0.17 per diluted share at the midpoint of our range after adjusting for the impact of the shares. We currently assume a 38% tax rate in order to approximate our long-term effective corporate tax rate. Details of my outlook are in the guidance tables at the back of our press release, line by line. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.77 to $0.80 on 32.2 million shares versus 29.5 million shares in the second quarter of 2014. These additional shares result in approximately $0.07 of dilution in the third quarter. In summary, I'm very pleased with CoStar's financial results for the second quarter 2014, which clearly show strong year-over-year organic revenue growth and increasing margins while adding Apartments.com. As Andy mentioned several times in the past, we believe the opportunity in the multi-family space is massive, and we believe we can make investments in the business now that will drive further growth and market share gains moving forward. We continue to believe that the company's operating in a market with multibillion-dollar revenue potential, and we are focused on executing on that plan to capture the opportunity. Operation of the company is making great progress towards the integration of Apartments, achieving the $20 million in annualized synergies we expected at the time of the acquisition. Product development pipeline looks great across many of our digital real estate services and marketplaces. Our sales management team is focused and driving steady improvement in sales productivity and increase, focused on many of the customer verticals where we currently have low penetration. I'm confident these combined efforts will continue to drive consistent year-over-year sales growth in the quarters ahead. Based on the growth trajectory of the combined businesses, as well as the expected synergies, I continue to believe we can reach our long-term goal of achieving the run rate of $1 billion in annual revenue sales and 40-plus percent adjusted EBITDA margins in 2018 based on the platform we have today. As always, I look forward to sharing our progress towards these goals with you in the coming quarters. And now we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America.
Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: In the first quarter, you saw your net new sales increase throughout the quarter. Did you see similar improvement during the second quarter? And could you talk about your expectations for net new sales in the second half?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, in the second quarter, the volatility from quarter-to-quarter and from month-to-month, it has a certain random element to it. It will have a volatility month-to-month. In the second quarter, May was our best month ever and -- but not by some sort of runaway trend difference between June and July -- between June and the other 2 months. That was sort of -- it was fairly level. We would expect that more and more of the salespeople approaching their first anniversary or their ninth month with the company would be beginning to see higher productivity, as well as half the managers in the sales force are also approaching their first anniversary. So fundamentally, we would expect to see some tailwinds in productivity as we move through the year. And just to put a little more on that, if you looked at the increase in the sales force, it really came at the end of the third quarter and mostly in the fourth quarter last year. So we're pretty pleased, being that last Q2 of last year was a high watermark, that we essentially were on par with that, and of course, it was up 9% over the first quarter. So we feel pretty good that later in the year, we should start seeing those productivity gains.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: When we look at the price gains that you've gleaned from going direct in the Apartments.com business, could you just talk about sort of how much progress you've made versus the potential for converting the indirect business to direct, and also the types of units or apartment buildings, I should say, that have been the focus? In other words, are they the 100-plus type apartment buildings, 100-plus type unit buildings? Is there any characteristics that inform sort of the ramp and the visibility to ongoing price gains and synergies over the next year or so?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. So in terms of what type of properties, I would say it is the traditional sweet spot of the Apartments.com business, which is in the 130-unit-plus category. So it's very smooth across it. There's no nuance about what converted from wholesale to direct by unit size. We've converted about 75% to 80% of those wholesale customers to direct, which is something I was very pleased the sales force pulled that off. My goal was to get that done by the end of this year, so to be at 75% to 80% in July hugely exceeds our expectation. And I felt that there was some risk around that conversion process. I'd say that risk for me is now gone, so we feel very happy about that. But there have been some prior market conversions from wholesale to direct in the past for Apartments.com, and what normally happened was that you would have a slight drop in market revenue as you did the conversions. And then, in the years that followed, you'd have an acceleration of revenue growth in those markets. And the reason that is, is that the newspaper sales teams were typically selling all sorts of things. They're selling car advertisements, residential, multifamily, and this is just one thing that they were carrying in their bag. Our Apartments.com sales force, this is what they do. We can control the process much -- in a much more effective way. We can add resources to markets where we think there should be resources added. So normally, you see an ongoing lift in growth in these conversion markets for quite some time. Some big markets that were really impacted here were Washington, D.C., Chicago, Phoenix, Indianapolis and a couple of others.
Brian J. Radecki: And so just to add to that, Andrew, so I have put this in my sort of revenue range for the year. It's great to actually sort of lock it in early. So it's sort of a onetime step-up in the sales, and then I think the sales will be pretty steady moving forward. Now just like with LoopNet, I know you covered them -- the apartment renting season, advertising season's pretty in full force in the second quarter. You get into late in the year and especially in Q4, it's a tougher comp. And of course, the majority of their customer base is not annual subscription. So just like with LoopNet, we're going to go through the same process, where we're going to start moving those over in the long term to annual agreements, but I've accounted for all that in my guidance range, so...
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: All right. The real question I want to ask is if you could talk a little bit about the organic growth calculation. I mean, if you just kind of back out $25 million of revenue, you end up with a figure that sounds like it's below the pro forma level. So I was hoping you could give us maybe a bridge, if you will, from the reported to the organic level, not a Brooklyn Bridge but just a growth bridge.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. So to give you some color on that, so all we did was we pro forma-ed sort of the year, so far the 6 months ended June. The business would have done, on a pro forma basis, about $289 million of revenue for '14 versus $254.7 million in 2013. So all as we did was take their numbers and our numbers on a pro forma basis. So it's grown about 13.5%. So we're sort of growing, again, plus or minus, on a bigger broad range, 12% to 15%. And I think that's a pretty good range that will be in here over the coming quarters as, again, which will relate to the sales force maturity and productivity. Now remember, you got the -- basically, the combined business -- the CoStar business before, 50% of them new, and now the Apartments business will go through the same thing, which actually might even be lagged by a few -- 2 or 3 quarters from the -- our core business. So that will -- again, those productivity gains will come in sort of at the back half of this year, Q4, and then really roll through to 2015, just sort of you're up, I would say, on more of a full run rate in 2016. But for people that were -- have listened to the calls and been around the meetings with Andy and I, I mean, realistically, the productivity gains actually continue to go up for 5 years. But obviously, you'll see the biggest increase in those first 24 months. So we're pretty excited. I think we're in a good position. We look forward to it.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Huang with Needham & Company.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a quick question for you guys. So obviously, the revenue synergies around Apartments.com stems from the conversion of wholesale to direct. I was wondering, I mean, could you talk about the activity and any early success that you're seeing selling CoStar information services into the Apartment.com customers? I mean, are we too early to see any benefit from that yet?
Andrew C. Florance: Michael, the answer is -- I can give you some good color around that. We are too early to have anything around that. So just like LoopNet, we focused on certain components and sequence. So to me, the very most important component was securing the wholesale revenue and then secondarily, making some immediate improvements to the site and then having everything in the bank for the plans for the next-generation sites. We've got all that behind us. We've also ramped the sales force. The phase of beginning the cross-selling with information is later in the year. I'll tell you that I met with a very small handful of customers, significant customers who I have come across in various functions. And I was excited to show them our plans for the next generation of the marketing website for Apartments.com. And I was thrown off by the fact that 100% of their focus went to what we could do for them on the information side. So I would sit in a presentation with some reasonably intelligent client for Apartments.com, and you show them this great marketing solutions, you're doing for 45 minutes, a lot of passion, they say, "Man, that information potential's fantastic. When can you help me with that?" So we think there's -- we know that there's a lot of potential there. Some of our very biggest customers have invited and solicited follow-up meetings on the information component, even though that's not in the first cycle for us. So we are going to be talking about that over the course of the next year or so, and I think it'll end up being similar to LoopNet in that you'll have a very strong information and marketing back and forth. And it will help, I think, to strengthen the relationship with these clients and build more meaningful long-term relationships, not the -- they're a great -- Apartments.com already has great relationships with its customers, but even stronger, real multilevel business relationships.
Brian J. Radecki: And just to remind everybody, just like LoopNet, I don't think we really started getting into that until 3 to 4 quarters into it. So as you guys listen to all the things that we've done in just the first 3 months, we're off to a pretty fast start. But it is a moment for self-reflection when you're disappointed that you're not paying enough attention to your marketing and they may want to buy. I can tell you about buying your information. Okay, guys. I'm not translating information, but I will. But I will, if you want.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Dobell with William Blair.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: If you were to look at the group of experienced sales reps, I think you called out 118 that have more than 1 year, they're doing $420,000-plus of annual gross sales. What did that number look like, I don't know, a year ago, 6 months ago? I guess what I'm trying to get at is your experienced guys, do they continue to see growth in that annual gross sales on a per capita basis?
Andrew C. Florance: I'll be giving you a somewhat anecdotal or an educated estimate of what that number would look like, but I'm fairly certain that it would be flat or down, and it would not be about competitive positioning, product value or economic. It would be more around disruption in the sales force associated with that level of growth. So managers are focusing on hiring, training, on-boarding, in many cases, learning the products themselves, meeting new customers. And some are -- and you get some number of salespeople start to fall through the cracks. So some of our very top producers -- Joe Pascal is still doing fantastic. But you get some folks in the middle who start to fall through the cracks when you have a much bigger sales force, and then you'll be able to -- they'll catch up with productivity and get back on their curves. So if you look at a 5-year continuous productivity gain, this throws a wave in that line, sort of growth throws a wave in that line, but you expect it to come back once you have everyone's sort of more grounded and has their sea legs.
Brian J. Radecki: And, Brandon, just to add to that, we're setting up calls with analysts for after the meeting and I think Rich or somebody was scheduling a 4:30 call, and they said, "Well, are you sure you guys will be done with your earnings call by then?" So the investor that e-mailed that knows who they are. So -- and just to add to Andy, so essentially, I do think that the cohorts of people that spill over each year, and obviously, we have a fairly high retention with people that have been here for over a couple of years, those cohorts do continue to get productivity gains over a 5-year period. And I think we've sort of shown that and talked about that, so. But obviously, right now, you just have a huge cohort and a new area that'll just continue to move. So this is going to be something again that's going to -- the big hiring push happens sort of late 20 -- or Q3. In the Q4, we are ramped up by the end of the year, and I think you're going to start seeing those gains. It'll really carry all the way through 2015 and so we're pretty excited.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Should we expect to get those metrics, those inexperienced and experienced, I guess, numbers of reps in their annual gross sales on future conference calls?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean, I think just like we do here, we try to give relevant -- we give some consistent metrics all the time, but we'll give relevant metrics each quarter based on what we're doing. I don't know that we're going to give it every single quarter, every detail number, but we're obviously going to be giving you guys insights on every call on how the sales force is doing, so...
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Peter Lowry with JMP Securities.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I know it's still early, but can you sort of discuss some of the high-level similarities and differences between your experience with Apartments.com so far versus LoopNet?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. Well, the businesses are extremely similar. Obviously, there are more players in the apartment sector, more competitors in the apartment sector. However, I would say that the apartment sector is probably more sophisticated, and their sense of their need for these sorts of products and services is more focused and more intense. So again, you have these professional investors with $200 million, $300 million assets, with hotel -- more hotel-like booking needs than a retail property that leases up for 10 or 20 years at a time. So the demand is very clean and clear. The customers are sophisticated. I would say there are many more similarities than differences, so SEM, SEO, site design, content advantages, information, marketing. A lot of the mistakes we've made over the last 28 years apply. That can give you some sense here what you should and shouldn't do. A lot of the sales force planning is very similar. And I'd say that through the last several months, my enthusiasm has climbed for the new space that we're in, and you see an awful lot of opportunity here. And realistically, it's an industry that has sort of, in my mind, fallen into a little bit of a pattern, and there's a lot of opportunity for innovation.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: I hate to burn my question on just a clarification, but I want to make sure I get it, so I'm going to do that. So you all said that there were $16 million of net new annualized subs, and you said it was basically the same as 2Q last year. But I recall that it was more like $14.4 million last year. Are my numbers wrong, or is there something that I'm missing on that?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean, I think we sometimes give several metrics, but the consistent metric, it was $16.1 million last year. It's $16.1 million this year. Just like we sort of gave a little color around the core CoStar family of brands this time, but the consistent metric is $16.1 million versus $16 million, so they're very similar. The $16 million was actually $16.043 million, almost rounded up to the same $16.1 million, but it was pretty close.
Andrew C. Florance: And last year, it was $16 million.
Brian J. Radecki: And I'll give you another question because that really was just a clarification.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: The question I have is on the Apartments.com property, one of the questions that we've got, and it seems like the advantage that you all will have in addition, Andy, to the work you're doing on the website design and the SEO and the conversion from wholesale to direct and et cetera is, obviously, your information advantage. And I recall that Apartments.com had -- was it 4 million units in their kind of research inventory? If I recall, you had something like 16 million or 17 million. I'm not sure those numbers are right. What -- how many of those incremental units over the 4 million that they have versus the 16 million or 17 million you have, when does that data go into the site? And is that one of the things you're going to use to draw more eyeballs to the site?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, so for -- I'm sure that I've got a dozen fine competitors on the call listening, and greetings to all of you today, and welcome to the CoStar earnings call, but the -- it is something that, from a consumer -- the industry, I think, historically, has really focused everything around how do I develop my business relationship with the property owner. And I think there needs to be more focus on what does the consumer want and the experience. I think that's a huge opportunity here. And the content we have, I think, will allow us to provide a much better experience to consumer. I think that it'll be a very similar game to -- if you look at what I was talking about with -- starting out with 31% of listings monetized at LoopNet acquisition, now moving that to 50%, continue to move that on up. I think it will be a similar kind of game where you'll have a mix of monetized and unmonetized, and you'll just try to move it to more and more monetized over time. But we believe that we can give a better consumer experience by using our research capabilities. And in terms of when we do that, I can't tell you.
Operator: And next, we'll go to the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about how you view debt in the capital structure. You've obviously got debt there today, but overall, it's a net cash position. And what would you like net debt-to-enterprise value to be over the long term for the business?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, sure. I mean, obviously, we're looking to optimize the capital structure. We believe that we sort of put the $400 million term loan to L plus 2%, and that drops over time with leverage ratios. Plus we have a $225 million revolver. So it's a combination of long term -- I believe, with the significant cash flow that we have, that we can have a slug of long-term debt and I think in the 2 to 4 turns range. We could flex up higher right after certain acquisitions because of the cash flow, but I think long term, we'll have 2 to 4 turns on there because of the high cash flow. And again, it'll move around based on strategic acquisitions and different things that we're doing, but I think we're pretty comfortable in that 2 to 4 range in the long term, again, having ability to flex up, keeping our options open with revolvers like we have. So I think that's a pretty good place for the company to be. It will give us opportunities to take advantage of strategic opportunities similar in size to LoopNet and apartments that we've done. You take the $466 million plus $225 million, you can see in our cash flow, we've got quite the capacity to do more strategic deals.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Okay, we do have another question from the line of Todd Lukasik.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Back again. Just following up on that and some of the earlier comments you made with regards to acquisitions. It felt like after the LoopNet deal that you guys were on pause for a little while with all the time that that was taking to integrating, get it to where you guys wanted it to be. Is there a similar situation with Apartments.com? Or if another large deal came around today, would you guys have the bandwidth to take that on?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, it would depend upon what kind of deal that was. So I think right now, the only way we would consider a transaction and something that we already did not have significant management expertise in would be as if it was a very unique opportunity. So we would likely be somewhat conservative in what we do in acquisitions that stretch management bandwidth. However, there are always opportunities to do acquisitions where the acquisition is more consolidation or something that is already well within our management competency all the way through our ranks so that the integrations occur at a level other than the C-suite. So to answer your question, it is -- there are a lot of things out there right now. We're looking at everything. Some are very interesting, but we prefer to focus on the great opportunities we have in LoopNet, CoStar, Lands of America, BizBuySell, Apartments.com, the debt and equity space. We've got a lot of good things to focus on, and we really only want do to things that support those core areas. Thanks, Todd. And I appreciate everyone. I think we just crossed the noon hour, so we're over our time limit. And I think AT&T is charging us about $1,000 a minute, so we appreciate everyone's time on the call today.
Operator: And that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T's Executive Teleconference Service. You may disconnect your line.

Andrew C. Florance: Rich, maybe you can help me figure how the airplane seatbelt works.
Richard Simonelli: You just clasp the buckle.
Andrew C. Florance: Welcome, and thank you for joining us. I'm very excited to talk with you today about the many positives we are experiencing at CoStar right now. We had a very strong first quarter of 2014. Revenue for the first quarter 2014 was $119 million. It's an increase of approximately 15% over the first quarter of 2013, as we continued to drive mid-teens organic growth. For the same period, EBITDA was $27 million, adjusted EBITDA was $37 million, which is an increase of 44% year-over-year and represents a margin of 31%. Our 12-month trailing renewal rate was a very high 93% and 98% for customers who've been with us for over 5 years. Our business is doing exceptionally well as sales continue to be strong across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The investment we made in the expansion of our field sales force is beginning to yield results as we recorded our strongest ever net new sales month. During the first quarter of 2014, the United Kingdom continued its profitability and drive towards margin expansion. Our LoopNet team had a very strong first quarter of net new sales, and the LoopNet marketplaces experienced all-time traffic records during the quarter. Most importantly, I'm also very enthusiastic about the huge potential we have with Apartments.com and the amazing progress we're already making. The more I learn about Apartments.com, the more excited I am about the opportunity we have here. Our goal with Apartments.com is to help 10 million Americans each and every year, rent a better home. It's hard to believe that it's only been 3 weeks since the close of the transaction. It feels like we have accomplished more in 3 weeks than we typically accomplish in the first 90 days plus of an acquisition. We have leveraged CoStar, LoopNet, Lands of America, BizBuySell and Apartments.com's product design teams, and we're nearing completion of plans for a revolutionary redesign of the Apartments.com website. As redesigned, the new website provides a superior consumer experience, gives advertisers more effective options and leverages Costar's significant content advantages. We have 138 software developers already identified and organized. We're beginning the 42 swim lanes of the redevelopment project. We are leveraging developers with various content mapping, back end, front end mobile infrastructure, multi-family and marketplace expertise from LoopNet, CoStar and Apartments.com to accelerate the project. Project diagram looks somewhat complex. The cultural fit with the folks at Apartments.com is fantastic and the camaraderie between CoStar, LoopNet and the Apartments.com staff over the past 3 weeks and actually, the past several months, has been very positive and even better than in many of the other acquisitions we successfully completed at CoStar. I'm certain that the combination of CoStar multifamily information with Apartments.com's existing organic search strength and excellent brand recognition will form a powerhouse in the multifamily space. But when you also add LoopNet's vast marketplace experience and expertise at driving enormous amounts of traffic to websites, along with Costar's outstanding leading-edge technology capabilities, I believe the result will be a fantastic, winning combination that cannot be matched. We believe there's a $1 billion revenue opportunity for marketing multifamily properties in the United States. It's not a tough thing to believe and we are off to a good start in our effort to position Apartments.com as the undisputed leader in the multifamily marketing space . I believe reasonable initial investments will be dwarfed by future cash flows. LoopNet continues to be an excellent performer. The first quarter of 2014 was the second highest quarter of net new revenue we have had since the close of the acquisition. And the premier membership revenue continues to grow at approximately double the rate it was growing prior the acquisition. The first quarter 2014 saw the most traffic ever for CityFeet, LandAndFarm and BizBuySell. For LoopNet and BizQuest, it was their second highest quarter of traffic. These sites are all leaders in their respective categories and continue to expand their user footprint with high levels of user engagement. With the addition of Apartments.com, we now have over 17 million unique monthly visitors in aggregate, coming to all of the various marketplaces we have . I believe we have well over 100 million visitors to our sites annually. The sales and marketing plan we have implemented for LoopNet has led to significantly more paid listings. Specifically, since the close of the acquisition in April 2012, we increased the number of paid listings on LoopNet by 55%, which was one of our import initial goals for us. Registered users have also increased since the close of the LoopNet acquisition. In the first quarter 2014, loopnet.com registered numbers grew nearly 20% from the prior year to 8.4 million, which is a 45% increase since the close. Our testing of new broker advertising on LoopNet is showing some exceptional early returns. We have approximately 14 salespeople selling broker ads, among other responsibilities, and in their first 2 months, they've sold an average of about $12,000 each on top of other revenue they're generating. In these early stages, broker ads are generating just under 10% of LoopNet's sales growth. We are averaging about $457 per month per sale from the small sample size of new clients. We plan to continue to expand the number of salespeople signing broker ads as we move through the year. As I've discussed previously, we've made significant investments in growing our sales force in the latter part of 2013. We believe this larger sales force will increase revenue growth later this year and into 2015 and beyond. At CoStar, we now have 218 field sales representatives. In the first quarter 2014, our annualized net new sales of subscriptions services were $14.7 million, which is in line with the first quarter of 2013 and in line with our expectations, given the temporary disruptions, typically associated with a rapidly growing sales force. We are also investing in the expansion of the apartments field sales force and expect to increase the team from 85 field sales representatives before the acquisition, to approximately 140 in 2014. We've already hired approximately 30 of these new sales executives. Again, a lot happening in the first few weeks. Just like CoStar, we believe that the larger sales force will help us realize more quickly, the great opportunity ahead. We believe this will set the stage for proved growth in a few quarters once we get those positions fully-staffed and up the productivity curve. Turning to the U.K. Momentum from the fourth quarter 2013 has continued into the first quarter 2014, even in the U.K. remains positive. We have a great management team and great team overall in place over there. And as for the U.S., we're investing in increasing the size of the U.K. sales force by approximately 50% over where they were last year. Upselling and upgrading the CoStar Suite has continued. Over 20% of the client companies of our legacy product focus have now upgraded to CoStar Suite, and we're continuing to have success signing up new clients. And a new trend is becoming a norm, U.K., commercial property debt and equity investors are the outsized drivers and buyer of our U.K. sales in our CoStar Property product there. CoStar Suite usage is growing really well over the United Kingdom. In the past 6 months, it's increased from an average of 600,000 page hits per month to a record 1.1 million last month and the first quarter monthly average is about 1 million hits a month, so we're getting good usage of the new product over there. As we announced last quarter, after 2 years of building a comprehensive database for Toronto, CoStar has entered the Canadian commercial real estate market this year. Within the first few months, we've signed up more than 150 brokers. These brokers using the product are giving us high marks for the service. These new clients are brands such as our long-standing U.S. and U.K. clients, Jones Lang LaSalle, and Newmark, Grubb Knight Frank. We expect to sign deals with other large household global brokerage names in the near future. We have signed a number of peer Canadian brokerage firms such as Cityspace, Sg Real Estate, Durham Commercial Real Estate, Ashlar Urban Realty and Lennard Commercial. We've signed up retailers like driven brands and REITs like Slate Properties. Slate Properties is a great example of how Canadian REITs are investing in the U.S. and Canada. They are actively acquiring retail centers across the U.S. and office properties in the greater Toronto area. Prior to CoStar launching in Toronto, they had no universal solution to analyze and evaluate properties both in the U.S. and U.K. They signed up for CoStar data, and within 4 days of seeing initial demonstration, they were a client. Our Canadian sales team has presented CoStar to 55 Toronto companies and are getting a very positive reception. I have participated directly in opening markets in the U.S., England, Scotland and now, Canada . I believe that this is the best reception we have received and that revenue will ramp-up at a faster pace than in past international market entries. In one meeting we had last week with a major brokerage firm, the marketing director told us it used to take her up to 4 days to build a client presentation because she had to pull content from about a dozen different Toronto info sources and combine them into one format. With CoStar, she thinks she'll be able to turn out a more complete and professional presentation in the same day. The most common and consistent comment we're hearing from clients and prospects in Toronto is the product is amazing, what took you so long to get to Toronto? It's a great sort of complaint compliment by signal. As I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, we've been working for almost a year with Interbrand, a leading brand consultancy to optimize our brand portfolio. We believe that by undertaking this project, we can accelerate our sales growth across our entire family of products. As CoStar Group experienced dramatic growth in recent years, both through acquisitions and organic development, the number of brands in our portfolio seem to grow exponentially. The same was true at LoopNet, which brought almost a dozen distinct brands into our portfolio. Shortly after closing that acquisition, I was working on a slide to present our newly expanded brand portfolio to employees and investors and we put all the different logos on 1 page, about 30 in all. We instantly realized how confusing it must be for our customers. To our customers, representing a disparate array of brands, each with a different visual identity and verbal personality. For example, CoStar's thousands of customers that would benefit from our PPR subsidiaries' interpretive analytic reports, forecasting advisory services, but many of these customers were not even aware that CoStar offers such services from a sister company. Similarly, many of PPR's high-end analytic and advisory customers did benefit from CoStar's granular data. But the disjointed branding and different software platforms make it difficult for the customer to make that connection. Most of Virtual Premise's customers are large corporations and retailers who would take comfort in knowing that the company they're entrusting to manage thousands of leases and billions in rent payments for them is a large, stable provider like CoStar. But there's nothing in our Virtual Premise identity to make that connection. Last week, we inked a $240,000 deal with Jones Lang LaSalle to provide them with Virtual Premise. Virtual Premise will provide software to support and help them cost effectively manage their huge transaction flow, while taking their already excellent customer service level even higher. That deal only happened because of the combined strengths of the CoStar and Virtual Premise brand, but we just make it too hard for people to see it. In this case, it was the CEO of JLL and CoStar working one-on-one in making these connections. But with the rebranding, it will make it easier for anyone to see those connections. I'll give you one more example. I recall talking to one of my best friends and a client of 27 years who just started a new job running a large region for major brokerage firms. He called me up and said, Andy, I've just purchased the most amazing CRM system. It's awesome, phenomenal reporting. He suggested I come over and look at it right away and he thought it would be a great acquisition target for CoStar. I asked him what the name was, he didn't quite remember and then he came up with REApps, but we already own REApps. And then it became clear that our portfolio was lacking the connectivity when our best customers didn't know all the different things they were buying from us or what our different brand connections were. With Interbrand's help, we are realigning the CoStar Group brand portfolio in a way that more accurately reflects the many ways we help our customers, provide them with information and insight and connecting them to the communities they need to move their business forward. The new structure will also make it easier for customers to recognize and assess opportunities across our portfolio. CoStar Group will continue to serve as the parent brand that will play a strong, connective role across our portfolio as we realign our businesses under 5 primary flagships. CoStar will serve as the single flagship brand for information analytics and software, and we'll be migrating all other information analytics and software brands to support offerings under the CoStar flagship. For example, PPR will become CoStar portfolio strategy; Virtual Premise will become CoStar Real Estate Manager; REApps will become CoStar Brokerage Applications, making it easier for my friend to identify the connection; and Resolve becomes CoStar Investment Analysis . I believe these businesses will benefit greatly from closer alignment with the CoStar brand. We plan to continue to invest in LoopNet as the flagship brand for marketing, and we intend to leverage the LoopNet brand to expand our marketing revenue internationally, starting with the U.K. and Canada. Apartments.com will be the flagship for the apartment home rental space. BizBuySell will be our flagship brand in the business for sale market. And Lands of America, the flagship for the rural land market. I should note that these Internet marketplaces represent an important exception to this move to consolidate brands. The secondary and tertiary marketplace brands we own have viable shelf space in Internet and search results, so we need to keep them unique. We plan to unveil the new brand structure to customers in mid-May, so please don't tell anyone 'til then, along with the new visual identity that most closely connect from the lines of business under the CoStar Group umbrella. You can see a sneak peek of our new logo on the cover of our 2013 annual report and you can also see that we reused my picture from last year. While CoStar -- we saved over like, $500. While CoStar is not a cyclical business, we do grow faster and stronger commercial real estate markets. The outlook for commercial real estate in 2014 continues to be good. We see solid demand growth from tenants, rising rents and good capital flows in the real estate sector. The U.S. economy and real estate markets are on course for broad improvement in 2014, and the United Kingdom is doing really quite well in addition. Steady economic growth and job growth is fueling healthy demand across the major property types and because new construction is still low, that is outside of the multifamily sector, markets fundamentals and rents continue to make solid gains. The recovery has become even more widespread. Even the hardest hit housing-based economies like those in Florida, Arizona and Nevada are joining the standout Texas markets to lead employment growth. The broad base of the economy is supporting solid rent growth for a low inflation economy with year-over-year increases ranging from 1.7% for retail to 3.8% for industrial. After a strong 2013, when the commercial real estate sales rose by 24%, preliminary results from the first quarter 2014 show that real estate sales are on track to nearly match last year's totals. I'm very pleased with where we are and where we're going as a company, as we continue to transform digital real estate for commercial real estate. The implementation of our transformational business plan at Apartments.com is ahead of plan and I believe will result in a key catalyst to our future revenue and margin expansion. I also expect that the increased size of our sales force will allow us to generate more sales and penetrate more markets and customer verticals effectively and efficiently. This month, April 2014, is an important milestone for CoStar's management team and the company overall. As a group, we are very motivated and focused on reaching our first billion-dollar year in revenue. As we close out a $119 million quarter with strong sales growth and the addition of Apartments.com, we unofficially reached $0.5 billion year revenue run rate about now. I want to congratulate my 2,500 colleagues on such a notable accomplishment and it reinforces our confidence in our ability and motivation to reach $1 billion in high-margin annual revenues. With that, I'm going to turn -- an exciting part of the call winding down, I'm now going to turn it over to Brian Radecki, our very confident Chief Financial Officer.
Brian J. Radecki: Thank you, Andy, I appreciate that, I guess. So the $0.5 billion, I guess, so when you look at the midpoint of next year's or next quarter's guidance, it's over $0.5 billion, so $476 million, so approaching $600 million already. So look at that. And the call, is not even over yet. We just upped the numbers. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2014. On the heels of an outstanding annual result in 2013, we reported 26% growth in annual revenues. 2014 is off to a great start the, growing organic revenue in the midteens, expanding EBITDA margins year-over-year and closing the Apartments.com acquisition. The company is clearly positioned for sustained, long-term growth. CoStar's information analytics and online marketplaces continue to show strong revenue growth and the ongoing success of the LoopNet integration an d cross selling efforts continue to be a big contributor to growth in both revenue and earnings. Today now, I'm going to primarily focus on the year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter of 2014, which is prior to the Apartments.com acquisition, and then I'll focus on our outlook for the remainder of 2014, which incorporates the Apartment.com business into our results. Starting with CoStar Group's results, for the first quarter 2014, the company reported $119.1 million of revenue, an increased of approximately 15% compared to $104 million last year. This revenue growth was driven by strong information services performance, strong revenue growth from LoopNet in all of our marketplaces. EBITDA increased $19.4 million to $27 million in the first quarter of 2014, up 7.6% or as my boss' favorite headline is, 255% from the prior year. He loves that stat, sorry. It kills me. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $37 million for the first quarter of 2014, which is an increase of $11.3 million or approximately 44% compared to the $25.7 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to $31.1 million in Q1 of 2014 from 24.7% last year. So that's a 6.4% increase year-over-year on a $476 million run rate, that's pretty significant. Net income from Q1 of 2014 was $9.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share, which is an increase of 12.1% from a net loss of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net income of Q1 was $19.8 million or $0.69 per diluted share, which is a 52% increase over the $13 million or $0.47 per diluted share from last year. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call today to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms in our press release issued yesterday and are available on our website at www.costar.com or just e-mail rsimonelli@costar.com. Cash and investments was $245.6 million as of March 31, 2014. Short-term debt totaled $148.8 million as of March 31, 2014. On April 1, 2014, the company entered into a credit agreement of $625 million, which includes a $400 million term loan facility and a $225 million revolving credit facility, each with a term of 5 years. Initial borrowing under the revolver is $150 million, so the total new debt outstanding on the company after we closed the acquisition is $550 million. The new debt was used in combination with cash on hand to fund the Apartments.com acquisition and refinance the existing debt. We expect approximately $14 million in total interest expense for this year. At this point, I'm going to give some additional color on a few metrics to highlight our strong performance in the first quarter of 2014. We achieved $14.7 million in net new sales of subscriptions services on annual contracts in the first quarter as a result of our ongoing success driving the sales of our information, cross-selling analytics and marketplace services into the business. This result is in line with the sales for the first quarter of 2013. Last quarter, Andy and I spoke at length about the great progress on expanding our field sales force, which now include 218 reps. It's possible now, we'll be welcoming approximately 85 reps from apartments, which will also be growing this year. Based on our aggressive hiring at the tail end of 2013, about half our reps have less than a year with us. We remain very focused on training and developing all these new sellers to bring them up the productivity curve as quickly as possible, which is typically 6 to 12 months. So while we're training and developing these new reps, I expect sales trends in the first half of 2014, as I talked about last quarter, to be somewhat lower than the prior years and then begin to ramp up in the second half of this year and really ramp all the way through 2015 as productivity increases throughout the sales force. Remember, half the sales force is new and they're learning from the other half of the sales force who's had experience, and that takes time and energy. Throughout 2013 into 2014, we have continued to deliver nice sales numbers while undergoing this significant transformation, and I will expect to start seeing strong returns from those efforts later this year. Obviously, we had a strong March, but we want to see another 3, 4, 5 months of strong sales. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was $91.5 million for the first quarter or 76.8% of total revenue, up from 73.1% a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $342.4 million, up 21% from the $283 million 12 months ago, 12 months ended March 31, 2013. So essentially, at the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 77% of our revenue coming from annual subscriptions. We continue to make progress upselling LoopNet subscribers on annual contracts, and we have increased the proportion of our revenue coming from annual subscriptions by about 6% since the LoopNet acquisition closed. The remaining 23% is primarily made up of marketing services including LoopNet's Premium Membership on monthly or quarterly agreements, as well as revenue from advertising across both platforms. The renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained very high during the first quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate on CoStar's subscription services was 93% in the first quarter, in line with the previous quarter. As we've discussed in the last few quarters as we continue to introduce more annual LoopNet contracts in the subscription base, it is expected to cause the 12-month trailing renewal rate to edge down slightly, possibly 1% or 2% over the next year or so. The renewal rate for CoStar subscribers who have been with us for 5 years or longer continues to remain at an astounding 98%, which is consistent for the past few quarters. As we move forward and begin to report financial results, which include Apartments.com, we'll relook at the metrics we're currently providing in order to make sure we're giving appropriate insight into the newly acquired marketplace. As Andy discussed, we're deep into the planning and integration of the Apartment.com team. We believe we have a great opportunity to accelerate the growth in that business. First, we have to carve out the Apartments.com business in technology and infrastructure from its old parent company and bring that into CoStar's data centers and technology environment. That's expected to take several quarters, but the work is already underway and that will come with some small incremental capital expenditures. Secondly, as Andy discussed, we'll be dedicating additional product design development teams from across CoStar to complete the redesign of the Apartments website and mobile applications. This is a large software development effort and will likely involve additional resources investment and some software cap. We also expect to eliminate some small non-core apartment services that are expected to impact revenues by $2 million to $3 million this year. In terms of selling and marketing, we've already started making some investments that we believe will drive increased revenue growth later this year, into 2015 and beyond. Obviously, I included synergies already. We're expanding the apartment sales force, just like we're seeing at CoStar, and we believe that will set the stage for improved growth in a few quarters as we get those positions staffed and up the productivity curve. In addition, we've made some additional marketing efforts to support this. As many of you on this call know, prior to the Apartments.com acquisition, CoStar successfully integrated 20-plus acquisitions in the digital real estate space since I've been here. As you can see from all the activity Andy and I discussed this morning, we are fully engaged to maximize the growth opportunities and ensure the success of the Apartments.com acquisition by applying all of our successful experiences from these prior acquisition, some just like LoopNet. Now, onto the outlook. I'll discuss the second quarter outlook and the full year of 2014. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, growth rates, renewal rates, which may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate or the overall global economy, among other things. Our guidance on the impact on foreign currency fluctuations on our top line results remain consistent. We do not attempt to predict foreign exchange rates or fluctuations on our guidance and we assume little or no volatility. Actual results may vary from these estimates. We're providing the outlook reflecting our current expectations as of today, April 24, 2014. Based on the April 1 closing date for the Apartments acquisition, our outlook includes the impact of the Apartments.com acquisition for the remaining 3 quarters. As we said when we announced the acquisition, we expect the Apartments deal to be accretive to 2014 non-GAAP earnings and adjusted EBITDA. Our outlook includes purchase accounting adjustments, as well as various fees and expenses associated with closing the transaction and integrating these companies. For the full year 2014, we now expect consolidated revenues of approximately $560 million to $570 million, which takes into account revenue from Costar's existing business of $490 million to $498 million, including our first quarter. So we've included some upsides from our first quarter there and revenue from the Apartments business from April forward, including some nice growth for them, plus on top of that, $3 million or $4 million of synergies realized in 2014, partially offset by a small reduction in $2 million to $3 million, as I mentioned earlier, of non-core revenue as I talked about. This revenue range equates to 27% to 29% annual revenue growth, which follows our 2013 reported revenue growth of 26% and follows a 30-plus percent year, the year before that. For comparison, in $3 million to $4 million in expected revenue synergies for this year, comparing that to sort of LoopNet, that is higher than what we recognized in the first 9 months of the LoopNet acquisition, so it's -- I'm putting lots of expected things in there and we've only owned the company for 2.5 to 3 weeks. So, I believe it's a pretty strong range, which really, like I said, we're including growth for them and synergies on top of that. We expect revenue for the second quarter in the range of $143 million to $145 million. When we announced the acquisition, we stated we believe we can achieve $20 million annualized synergies over the next 24 months. This estimate includes both revenue in cost synergies. Just like we achieved at the LoopNet acquisition, there's potential for significant revenue synergies throughout the cross-selling of both platforms and customer bases. So obviously, we hope that, that number is bigger as time goes on. In terms of earnings, we're raising our guidance range for 2014 fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share to 3.05% to 3.15% per share based on 28.8 million shares. We currently assume a 38% tax rate to approximate our long-term effective corporate tax rate. Just like the revenue, our guidance includes CoStar's existing business with the guidance we gave in February, 6 weeks ago -- wait, let me read that again, 6 weeks ago of $2.92 to $3.02 per share. We added some upside from our strong first quarter. We added the impact of the Apartments acquisition for the last 3 quarters of this year. We had a little higher interest expense, the impact on the acquisition to interest expense for the debt of $0.18 and investments we're making in selling and marketing for the remainder of the year, which represents about $0.19 per share and $9 million. As shown in our guidance table at the back of our press release, we are increasing our estimate for adjusted EBITDA by about $15 million to a range of $171 million to $175 million of EBITDA. The increase is primarily related to the impact of the Apartments acquisition. I'm going to add a little bit. So just make sure everybody's clear, I didn't line item all the cost to carve out the business. We did process payroll on day 1 of CoStar. So if you understand what a carve out looks like, they didn't have any other owned payroll processing accounts payable, they didn't have their own server rooms, so CoStar has to move and bill all that. So there's a lot of other expenses in here, but I didn't want to line item out the $50,000 for payroll, the $5,000 for granola bars and the $400 for plant service for the new things. So there are some other costs associated. The core CoStar business continues to go strong, most of the additional costs are on Apartments for this year. So for the second quarter of 2014, we be expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.69 to $0.73 based on 28.8 million shares. In summary, I'm very pleased with CoStar's financial results for the first quarter of 2014, which clearly shows strong organic growth and margin expansion. As Andy mentioned several times, I believe the opportunity in the multi-family space is massive and we believe we can make the investments in the business now that will drive further growth and get the Apartments growth rates up to the CoStar business and LoopNet business and possibly higher, and market share gains moving forward. Like the acquisitions we have done for decades and specifically over the past few years, we believe the Apartments.com acquisition significantly increases Costar's addressable market in the digital real estate space and allows us to leverage our industry-leading assets and information analytics and marketplaces to accelerate revenue growth at high incremental margins. We continue to believe the consolidated company is operating in a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity and we are focused on executing to capture that opportunity. Based on the growth trajectories of the combined business today, as well as the expected synergies we expect from the businesses, we believe we can deliver on our long-term goal of achieving a run rate of $800 million of annualized revenue at a 40-plus percent adjusted margin in the fourth quarter of 2016, 1 year earlier than previously expected. And since -- I'm going to adlib again here. Since Andy just let the cat out of the bag, we believe we could actually reach $1 billion with the current platform today, somewhere around the fourth quarter of 2018. And if you want the model, just e-mail Andy at costar.com, and he'll send it to you.
Andrew C. Florance: $1.25 each.
Brian J. Radecki: Now, as I've been here for 17-plus years going 18 years and we've done 20-some deals, we've obviously equated a little over a deal a year and we've obviously done a couple of deals in the past couple of years. So if you really want my personal opinion, I'd be shocked at 2018, in 5 years from now, if we haven't done other accretive acquisitions and we get to $1 billion sooner than that. And as you'll calculate from your models from my 2016 exit rate and the 2018 rate, that equates to midteens growth on a business that's getting much larger each year. So clearly, I'm confident in where we're going. And with that, I'd like to thank you all. We look forward to sharing our progress of these goals on you in the coming quarters, and I'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of Brandon Dobell, William Blair.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: A couple of things. First, our focus on, let's call it the core business, for a second, the net new sales figures you guys gave, maybe some color about what's driving that. Is it cross-sell for existing customers? Is it adding new customers? I guess I just want to understand, I guess, the basic components of that and how we should think about those major components contributing to increase net new sales as you work through the balance of this year?
Andrew C. Florance: It's actually across the board. We've had 1 or 2 months where virtually everything is performing well and we're getting contribution, both from the U.K., from Virtual Premise, from LoopNet, from CoStar. It's a blend of new and upsell accounts. Both U.K. and U.S. are in this mode of upgrading people from a low-end platform to a high-end platform. In the case of U.S., it's LoopNet information, CoStar information as in the in U.K., it's focused to CoStar Suite. So that's continuing. It's both -- it's in the brokerage area and the debt and equity area. There's a decent amount of inter brand-related sales like the Jones Lang LaSalle sale with Virtual Premise. One of interesting things we're seeing is that as we bring in these newer salespeople in the field, they are selling a disproportionately higher percentage of LoopNet. So they're selling the newer folks are looking at all the different things they can choose from to sell and they're selling about 50% more LoopNet per person than the traditional salespeople. So I like it -- I like what we see in terms of it being all cylinders and not one big driver.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Maybe to take that last point there, Andy, one step further. Is there any concern among the team that, as you add more salespeople, they kind of find the path of least resistance to new customers, but that path entails a lower average selling price. So therefore, relative to the size of business, that you've got to run faster in sales force headcount to get the same incremental dollars added in that new sales because they're focusing on, again, the products that are $200, $500 a month, as opposed to the multi thousand dollar products in the core CoStar database?
Andrew C. Florance: No, I wouldn't say that. I don't think that's the case. So in that general sales force, they've always had the option to run the spectrum from $295 a month to count on up to these multi thousand dollar accounts. The bulk of sales have always occurred around that $500, $590 a month of sale. And as I mentioned, newer things like the broker ads, they're coming in exactly $590 a month. So we're seeing a lot of annual business coming into LoopNet and a lot of business pricing at the $590 at LoopNet and pricing of the $590 a month in the CoStar. So really, the only stuff that comes in consistently at a $1,000 of month is the -- officially $1,000 a month is debt in equity sales. Newer markets where you are bringing on a Jones Lang LaSalle Toronto, those come in about $1,000 a month or those bigger numbers. So it actually it's pretty good and overall productivity numbers are looking fairly solid and there's no discussion. I'm hearing zero discussion of anything that looks like salespeople struggling to find room to sell because of the growth of the sales force. There's -- they're not bumping into each other in any way, shape or form. And as we bring in Apartments.com, the size of that market -- if you look at the size of that potential market in year 1, we're really focusing on probably 6 or 7 markets we think have exceptional growth potential and we don't want to grow that sales force too quickly. But as we go into 2015, we will definitely be doing more integration between these sales forces and giving them even more in their toolkit to sell. And then we think all of these products are pretty good price points there -- the ROI on field salesperson across all these products looks really good. So we're happy with what it looks like and improving what these ROIs look like across these businesses by different approaches to how our packaging contracting and selling them.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. I know you had spoken of Apartments.com for a second. I think it's pretty clear to me how you guys can make their business better, like faster growth, more salespeople, better tech investment, those kinds of things. What do you view as the opportunity for what Apartments does well or does in general to make the core CoStar's side of the house or the LoopNet side of the house better? So that -- is there a 2-way flow of things that make both institutions or organizations better or is it you bringing CoStar competencies over to the Apartment side?
Andrew C. Florance: No. There's -- there is a couple of things that stand out from Apartments.com. I mean, I won't be able to list them all roughly back but there are some nuances in their marketplace designed things they focus on, and in a way they take that to their customers. So they really bring a lot of their marketplace strategy back to quantifying the actual leads deliver the way Google gives you a natural conversion rate on your SEM campaigns. So they really try to quantify for their customers the actual lead flow they're pulling in. I think that's very viable across all of our marketplace platforms and even useful for our peer brokerage, CoStar Property platform. The other thing I really like about the firm, that comes back our way is, I like their high touch, continual sort of customer connection on the advertising side. If you bring Brad Long's approach to a high-touch customer service into the LoopNet's side of the market, I think that will re-energize -- like now, like -- not like LoopNet needs to be reenergized. LoopNet's certainly doing great. But when you bring that sort of Apartments.com customer focus and high touch continuously, quantifying for the customer face-to-face, to kind of results they're getting for their marketing campaigns from us. When you bring that asset to and that culture to the LoopNet sales process, I think the LoopNet sales process lights up. So I think that's exciting. And then, there are -- these folks have been thinking a lot about how to improve their marketplace and there are some good ideas that they bring to the table. So it's a good mix. And CoStar, LoopNet and Apartments, they're very different organizations, and they historically, very different organizations. And if you can tap to the strengths of each, you'll end up with a pretty strong mixture. It's a nice melting pot.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: It's a nice melting pot. All right. Then final one for me, you mentioned the branding changes I think 30 down to a smaller number. With either from a technology point of view, sales point of view, and get -- maybe an organizational point of view, what's that going to look like for you internally? Is -- does the branding stuff make it easier for the sales guys to sell? Or does it allow you to reduce the number of platforms that you have to support internally? I guess I'm just trying to figure out that in what you guys would see internally, or what your employees would see internally versus what we're going to see externally.
Andrew C. Florance: Right. I think some of it is subtle but important so as the employees see these more logical naming of the products in connection to the product that reminds them that we're 1 team and that we have to put the customer first and then it's about delivering the best results to the customer, not maintaining the nuances of some old -- older brand or strategy that's now outdated, in the context of 1 unified company. So for instance, without a doubt a customer who is investing in apartment buildings, wants to be able to have 1 log in to access anything PPR can do for them, anything CoStar can do for them, anything LoopNet does for them and anything that Apartment.com does for them. So our -- we are on the central theme here is to eliminate limited software platform and get down to fewer and fewer software platforms, 1 password for the customer across the whole family, be it Virtual Premise, be it real estate manager, be it our CRM solutions across the whole premise. So the fewer platforms, more focused on the customer not the brand delivering the value and tighter integration between these different product areas and it does make it easier for the salesperson to increase the confidence of the salesperson that this is one of the products I carry and the salesperson may not be able to sell our risk analytics product to somebody with their level of experience or product expertise, but they have a good relationship with the prospect they can develop the interest than bringing a specialist. And I think having it all in one common brand gives them greater confidence in doing that. So I think they'll be -- it's an expensive process. I tell you, if you look at the rebranding, and you look at the different treatments visually and you look at the taglines, it's obvious. It couldn't be more obvious and I've been living in the new brand now for about 6 months even though it's not released and I go back and I'm proactive [ph] I'm confronted with what our reality is today. This what the new brand looks like, and I can't believe how bad but we have today looks compared to where we're going. So that's way too long answer for you. I apologize.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Brett Huff, Stephens, Inc.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: One housekeeping question, Brian. You mentioned a metric 6% and 23% relative to Loop, and I just didn't understand what that metric was. Can you just reiterate, I apologize, to ask you to do that, you just reiterate what that meant?
Brian J. Radecki: 6% and 23%?
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Brian J. Radecki: Was that talking about the -- I think I was talking about the adjusted margins increasing by 6% from 31% to -- 31.1% to 24.7%. So this is talking about the fact that adding 6.4% of EBITDA, $176 million run rate is a pretty large number year-over-year.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And then the -- I know that we're not calling out the Loop cross sales specifically anymore. But I do think there is a question that we've been asked a lot is, give us a sense of the Loop cross sale performance, whether it's -- the conversion rate still sort of mid-30s or just give us of maybe a qualitative view on -- should -- did that taper? that should ask the that taper in 1Q?
Brian J. Radecki: I don't fit believe it did taper. So to be honest with you, I did not have numbers from this month on that. But my sense of it is that it would not have tapered. It would've continued to increase. So we hit a point, maybe about 3 months ago, where I was seeing significant improvement in the sales force's ability to give this up upsell conversions. I think it's just part of the sales force culture now and it's north of that -- it's probably in the upper 30s on conversion rate. The interesting thing is, I also see them beginning to be good at going into a firm who's been using LoopNet very pleased peacefully, like there was a big firm in the big firm in Seattle who had a huge firm in -- not in Seattle, huge firm in Salt Lake City that had been purchasing LoopNet ad hoc, individual accounts for years and years and years across a hundred different brokers. And the salesperson went in there, and his first -- has successfully upsell them to a bigger purchasing plan on annual agreement across all the brokers in that firm and then they're already migrating into moving into, now moving them up to the CoStar information contracts. So I think they're actually getting better at it and the sales force is coin-operated in that if there's money to be gotten. That's where they go and there's clearly money there. And the -- we -- the bottom line is, we still only captured 25% -- 20% of that potential upsell and the opportunity that grows faster than we're capturing, which is good news, and that would be a specific example of the Salt Lake, where the first and first created the LoopNet sale in order to get the CoStar upsell. So it's going -- and that continues well.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, the -- on the $0.19 of sales and marketing spending on Apartments.com you all called out. I think one of the -- since you bought Apartments.com, I think many view that as a little more consumer-oriented than some of the other things you've done just because you're pitching to a renter to come to your site. Can you talk a little bit about the persistence of the need to spend on not -- building the brand or drawing people, drawing eyeballs to the site et cetera, and kind of how that fits in? Is that $0.19 kind of -- whatever that number is, is that ongoing kind of thing or what is the -- what are your thoughts on that. Is my question clear?
Rupert Pearce: Yes, it is. So it is -- Apartments.com is more similar than dissimilar to what we're already doing. So all of your revenue is coming from very traditional commercial real estate professionals. And a huge piece of that incremental spend is connected with strengthening our relationships, increasing our sales force so we can reach out to more of these traditional folks who own, manage and operate thousands and thousands of these income-producing rental properties. So a lot of money is going to basically ramping up a level of underinvestment we saw in just selling the product B2B. There is some investments being made in increasing awareness of Apartments.com to the consumer audience and driving more traffic. I'd actually put that at a less than half -- Brian might have a better idea of exactly what it is. The more important changes, the much more important changes to reach in the consumer with Apartments.com are improving the consumer experience at the website. There's some low-hanging fruit to be achieved by improving SEL and some SEM strategies and crosslinking between the different sites. But the most important thing is building a better website with more content and giving the consumer better experience, which I think we're well positioned to do and that is not about massive, massive, massive continued budgets. So this is an asset that realistically, look at Apartments.com, who was owned by a consortium of well-known newspapers. And not surprisingly, those well-known big newspapers are focused on cash flow and the businesses run for cash flow sometimes at the cost of potential returns 18 months up. It's just -- there are a couple of pieces on that, too. So essentially Brad, I think what you're also asking is, yes, I mean, I think that's investment in the business. So if you look at LoopNet, we invested in some of that business also to begin with, resulting in $50-plus million of revenue at a 90% renewal rate over the next 10 years, generating $400 million, $500 million of revenue at a 70% to 80% margin. So I think the -- yes, these are investments we're actually adding salespeople. We're going to add 30, 40 salespeople by the end of the year and I'm already actually including -- if again, if you look at it, I'm including our revenue in the first 9 months in my number than I did. I'm confident that we've done this before, so obviously, I feel pretty good about it. So people shouldn't think that I'm not being conservative, I mean, I'm putting some good numbers, good growth on their business, good, but we obviously have to hire the people and perform. But, I believe, that, that revenue that you sell, of course, again, over a 10-year period is going to result in hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of EBITDA from investments that we're making today. Clearly, there's already almost $1 billion of revenue in this area already being spent today, marketing on both offline and online. So we capture another $100 million or $200 million of that over the next x number of years at an 80% margin. It's just a -- it' s a massive, massive return. So for me the way I look at it is, when you look at the '16 exit, '18 exit is, you're investing a little bit today and then you're going ultimately get their business, higher revenue growth and then ultimately higher EBITDA in just a few short years and then, of course, you run that oven, your DCF and it creates massive value.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Great, that's helpful. And then last question is just another housekeeping, sorry. But you guys had called out, maybe sunsetting some loop revenue of $10 million to $12 million this year and also spending $0.10 to $0.12. I think mostly on 1Q, on supporting the launches in November, if I'm remembering right. What is the status of those? What was in the quarter? What was pushed out, et cetera?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure, it's Brian. So yes, I mean, I think a lot of it was basically branding and Andy, obviously talked pretty extensively about branding. So I think for the most part, we're sort of where we thought we were on the investments. I mean, I'd -- is there a couple of dollars that go between Q1 and Q2? Yes, possibly. But obviously, we've spent a lot of time on this branding project and a lot of money.
Andrew C. Florance: And there are 3 or 4 product areas there where we look and it and about 3 product areas where we look it when we think that will generate millions in revenue. We think ultimately, it's suppressing our earnings over an 18-month horizon out. And it's always difficult for any company to say, okay, going to give up this $3 million, I'm going to shoot those $3 million of revenue because each quarter comes around, I'm supposed to tell you about the maximum amount of revenue this quarter but clearly, these things or not the right investments. Now there's -- I don't want as you want to give any potential competitor anywhere, any kind of heads up on how they try to capture any of the revenue we're shooting. So I'm not going to go into detail on what we're shooting. But we're just doing that good character thing where you shoot the stuff that's not right for the company over 18 months or more.
Operator: And the next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones for me. I guess, we're in the afternoon now, I think. With regard to the sales organization, one of the things I didn't hear you necessarily call out today is the efforts you spent in the customer base beyond brokers into property owners and managers and, so forth. It sounds like you're asking the salespeople to do a lot of things, kind of walk and chew gum at the same time. Can you just talk about how as they come on and you train them and they sort of get their feet wet with CoStar with priorities are and perhaps some of the sort of end-market expansion efforts, they spend a lot of time talking about the last year or 2. Maybe, we're looking more into '15 to hear about traction there and this is more about a year of just ramping shelves host to get their productivity up on its core products?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure. So this is fairly dramatic and appropriate expense of sales force, bringing -- coming together at LoopNet just made it crystal clear. We can look at where LoopNet had success selling to commercial real estate professionals. We saw a complimentary and sort of inverse pattern. So we realized, like as example, that we had a West LA office and we had tremendous penetration downtown LA, Orange County, West LA, on up into up towards Santa Barbara. We didn't have an office in Inland Empire, LoopNet picked up 6,000 customers over in Inland Empire. It makes it obvious we should have an Inland Empire office and several salespeople there in the combined companies. So right off the bat, coming out of LoopNet, we knew we had to increase the number of territories. We could see, it was one of the great exhaust benefits of the LoopNet acquisition was getting a phenomenal transparency in how to optimize your sales force or where you should be investing for your sales force. So setting the goal of having this larger footprint of sales force and more field sales rather inside sales in your investment mix, we had to double the size of our management team, the sales management team. And we brought in some tremendous talents over the past year in the management team. So when I look at the experience set from companies like LexisNexis, Reuters, paychecks, all sorts of information, subscription, product areas, we've really added some horsepower to our the sales management team. I -- if you're on our sales management team, and you talked to one of these folks, you will hear that the CEO of our CoStar is maniacally focused on onboarding these salespeople and having these sales managers participating in the field, intensively, one-on-one with these new people and getting them up to that critical first 6 months, confidence building, moving them out of the classroom and into the field training mode. And I'm looking at a report showing that our managers are doing hundreds and hundreds of in-the-field customer meetings with these new reps and supporting them and we have all sorts of safety nets to try to make sure that these folks were onboarding, don't fall through the cracks. Because as we get this larger team successfully stood up, it's a tremendous resource. You're exactly right that it is a high-priority to begin to segment these sales forces into a debt and equity group, a general information sales group and an advertising sales group. 3 large distinct sales forces. First priority is to have all the players in place. We are making a lot of it done and initiatives on growing that debt and equity group, which has multi thousand month accounts. We just recently identified one salesperson from each of, I believe, 35 regions to attend advanced training up in Boston on the debt and equity space and the PPR product offerings. As we move in 2015, those folks will begin to move over. I mentioned the Apartment.com sales force and ad sales culture. That creates a foundation 2015 for segmenting our ad sales force over there. But you're absolutely right. We're asking a lot of them and they'll perform more effectively if we allow the sales force to focus down on one vertical and focus on the needs of these individual verticals. So it's an ongoing process and from start to finish, management, scaling up the number of salespeople and then segmentation is the top of the pyramid.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: All right. And then, just to get a little more granular on the Apartments synergies and timing of marketing spend, could you give us a sense of when we're going to see that redesigned website and whether the marketing spend and sort of the associated revenue contributions that Brian laid out will be -- is that a second quarter event with the spend coming hard on the heels of the redesigning? What sort of the timing as far as Apartments beginning to contribute?
Andrew C. Florance: It spread across the year and there'll be incremental releases of -- incremental improvement releases throughout the year. And where the biggest impact of the release is in 2015. So smaller incremental releases in '14 and bigger impact in '15 and the spend relatively smooth throughout the year.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, the spend is smooth but what I will say the spend is immediate. So we've owned them for 3 weeks and I think we have a class of 20-some salespeople that we've already hired for them. So we're already ramping up -- we've already made the immediate spend. I mean, like literally on Day 1 in the selling and marketing area, and that's why I have enough confidence to put in the revenue for this year and again, more than I had, more than we actually did in LoopNet in the first 9 months because obviously we have a blueprint and a game plan to follow and we feel very confident in that. So the spend is immediate whereas waited with LoopNet that ramped up a bit more. It's immediate and pretty consistent.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So the website redesign really need, as we look out to '15 and beyond, we got to start to get some of the more explicit advertising revenue perhaps that you anticipate from March?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, correct.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Now I think I should note this just because it was over an hour ago that -- but I just wanted to compliment Rich on his dramatic reading of the Safe Harbor. And to thank him for those new legal tidbits. All right. So the -- I saw -- one of these I'd like to ask you to do is to talk about the kind of the normalized contribution from Apartments.com, on the EBITDA line in 2014. Because we had -- I think components -- you gave some of the components but it sounds like there were some other components there, too, that you didn't necessarily break out. If we look at the $15 million increase in the EBITDA guidance, and you have about $9 million coming for specific marketing expenses and then another -- I assume about $2 million for that $2 million to $3 million discontinued revenue and then probably another $5 million that you would then deduct from that because that was kind of your -- that was your beat in the first quarter, if you will, get you to around $20 million to $25 million -- $20 million to $21 million in what a normalized contribution from Apartments.com without all those special expenses in there would've been. Is that a fair way of looking at that?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, I mean, I think that's pretty fair. I mean, again, Bill, I didn't get into the multitude of things where we are investing in. And then again, I mean, there's just a whole back-office operation in moving them. We're moving them into new space by the end of May. We've got new servers. And so there's a lot of detail in there but what I do was I broke out the big pieces, so after you get past these big pieces, it's 50,000 here, 200,000 there, 10,000 there, lots of it, such as increased travel. We've got -- at any given time, if you go to the JW Marriott in the loop, and you walk through the lobby, you will undoubtedly in the morning and it night see on the high top at least 5 to 7 CoStar people every single night. CoStar, LoopNet people. So I didn't go through a break a lot but the way you did it is about the right. I mean, I included upside for the CoStar business, I can go through all the different spending on the Apartments business but yes, generally, you're about right. If you took their EBITDA and you took 3 quarters of it, you're going to be around $20 million, $20 million, $21 million. So your sort of map is generally correct, plus or minus $1 million here, there.
Marc Fuller: All right. And then, I was very glad that you pointed out the -- or you set the EBITDA margin target exiting fourth quarter '16 at 40% or better. The question I have is, the second quarter guidance is more like, it's on the 30%. And so, how should we think about the progression in that EBITDA, not so much in '14 because I think you've given us that guidance but it implies -- how to think about that in '15.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes. And so, I mean, it's -- what I would say is, as we sort of talked about on the call, there's investments upfront here, right? And so we just talked about a lot of those. And then similar to CoStar, as you invest in their sales force this year, it will also be ramping up all the way through next year. So I think next year is -- and will be, again, incrementally releasing new releases on the development website, and as Andy said, more to come in '15. So I think that the steeper slope of the ramp is out in '16. But I expect nice steady growth through '15, also, but obviously, I believe, the steeper ramp both on revenue and earnings will be in '16 as you sort of start to see the results of that, right? So you start seeing results in early first half of '15 and as you move through '15, you'll then get those full year impact of those in '16, right? You're only to get partial of your impacts from upside of those. So I would say, we still expect nice growth, top and bottom line, obviously in '15 with the steeper ramp in '16.
Brian J. Radecki: And just to be clear, Bill, none of these investments were my idea. As Brian so incredibly bullish on the opportunity insist that I invest in it.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Does Brian get credit for the granola bars, too? $5,000 in granola bars?
Andrew C. Florance: That is clearly Andy because I'm the most unhealthy eater at the company. But just to remember, Bill, the easiest way for you to build your 5-year model is just e-mail Andy at costar.com. He will just send it over to you because he always let the cat out of the bag. I can't keep anything a secret.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Well, I wanted to ask on the revenue side. I needed to ask about March, because you did call it out as the strongest net new sales month that you've seen. And I just wanted to ask, we know it was a single month but I just want to know if you were to annualize that level, what kind of a number we'll will be looking at? We know it's better than $15. million. $20 million?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean, Bill, I'm not even going to go there and annualize 1 month. As we know, numbers go up and down from month-to-month. Obviously, we have a very new sales force again, half of the sales force that's experienced is spending a lot of time with half the sales force that's not. So, I believe, we will see a steady ramp this year with obviously someone's being better than others. It's obviously encouraging to us but I would -- I want to see how we do, obviously as we stream together a couple more quarters. And even with Apartments, I mean, if you look at it, I added it in the revenue. I added growth to them, I added synergies of to. I wasn't cheap on what I put in my model for them. And I would like since we've only -- it's only been 22 days since closed, I'd like to at least get a quarter or 2 behind me before sort of like -- even as we report Q2 and Q3, I hope people haven't people jacking up their '15 numbers and jacking up their '16 numbers because it's like, let's get a little experience. Clearly, I have a lot of confidence, or I wouldn't have done that. And clearly, when you look at the blueprint on LoopNet and we're using a lot of that blueprint on Apartments, we feel really confident in success here. So we're -- I mean, I can't wait for the next quarter and the following quarter number to report. I think it's going to be great.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: One last question for you, then. Then, in terms of your total addressable market. Now that you've acquired Apartments.com, how would you size that and how -- the first is, how you would size that and then second is, how would you give us and proud brush strokes how you got there?
Brian J. Radecki: Well, without being terribly creative, I believe that the apartment communities who we researched, and identified over the last several years are already spending well over $1 billion in digital marketing. And with a very, very fragmented group of players. Some where exactly head-to-head competitors with Apartment.com. and then there's some variations of roll your own SEM strategies and the like. But it's unusual to look at a space like this and at this point, see well over $1 billion of actual spending and we're going to identify these various budgets. It is over $5 billion in marketing for apartment communities in total in all the different vehicles, concessions, direct spend, and the like, or locator fees, and the like. But if you put the market between $1 billion and $5 million, you're capturing the whole information side of the business, which is equally important to us. So massive underwriting. It's a multitrillion dollar asset class, lots of underwriting, lots of buying and selling these assets, the securitization of these assets. There's the REITs, there's the individual entrepreneurial owners. There's the larger institutional owners. And then there are, there's a whole broad ecosystem. There's some very large hard-quality companies that are producing software solutions for these same multifamily owners. So you definitely have a $10 billion space here. So if I look at just digital services to the apartment space, the direct spend is already probably approaching $2 billion. So it's a decent size space to plan. And the nice thing is, I like the fact that in a Apartments.com area, it's still highly fragmented.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Lowry, JMP Securities.
Peter Lowry - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Just one quick question here. Andy, you mentioned that the more you learn, the more excited you are about the Apartments.com opportunity. Maybe you could share sort of how your view on that opportunity has changed or what you learned since you announced the acquisition?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, you're always going into an acquisition like this. You do all the research you possibly can. You -- we understand the market from a lot of our experiences at LoopNet and BizBuySell, Lands of America. We understand the multifamily space from the information side. As you get in there, and you get to work side-by-side with the management team, you actually explore some of details and nuances of what's occurring. You start to spot things that you've seen before. You see opportunities that -- anytime you have 1 management team in the company, running it for a decade or 15 years, that's easy for another management team with the difference of set of experience to come in and see opportunities. And so you just see just the whole plethora of financial opportunities to go after, that could be sales tactics, marketing tactics, pricing tactics, a lot of the upside we've got from LoopNet was just how you price the products more effectively to reach the customer's budget, how the customer wants to spend money. So that is certainly the case with Apartments.com. And then also, my own personal -- I'm a risk-averse individual and I don't like to mess these things up and the more you learn, and the more you see the teams working together, and you see more see people moving towards taking Apartments.com to the next level, you start to feel the risks are starting to fall away from me and I feel more confident about the potential here and that probably is an understatement about how a number folks feel about what could be built here with Apartments.com given the talents of the management team talents we've got across the spectrum. There are plenty of really good people here at CoStar to go execute something like this to make up for any shortcomings I have.
Richard Simonelli: So with that, we're going to go ahead and wind up the call, and thank you very much for joining us and we'll look forward to speaking with you on next quarter's earnings call. Thank you very much and good job.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining while using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

It's also available on our website right after the call. So without further ado, I'd turn it over to Mr. Andy Florance.
Andrew C. Florance: Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. 2013 was clearly the best year in CoStar's history. We had an exceptionally strong year in all aspects of the business, and we believe we are positioned to continue to grow at high margins for many years to come. I am very pleased with our outstanding financial results, which are the direct result of our entire organization of 2,000-plus professionals working hard to create valuable products for the huge community of commercial real estate professionals we serve. We increased revenue by $91 million in 2013, growing it to $441 million for the year. We continue to grow the top line to mid-teens, as our fourth quarter revenue was nearly $116 million, which is approximately 16% year-over-year growth. EBITDA for 2013 was $94 million. This is a 56% increase over 2012 and, by far, the most EBITDA we've generated in our history. Adjusted EBITDA margin accelerated to over 35% for the fourth quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted EBITDA margin was 25%. Margin expansion continued throughout 2013 while we continued to aggressively invest in the business. Our 12-month trailing renewal rate was 93% and 98% for customers who've been with us for 5 years. In 2013, we added nearly 4,800 new CoStar information subscription customers, which is the most we've ever added in 1 calendar year. Our annualized net new sales of subscription services in the fourth quarter was $15.8 million, an increase of 15% over the third quarter of 2013 and a 46% increase year-over-year. Our fourth quarter 2013 subscription-based revenue reached $87 million for nearly a 21% year-over-year revenue growth rate. So we're really quite pleased with our revenue momentum and our earnings momentum. The LoopNet acquisition integration has been extremely successful and beneficial for customers and shareholders alike. We have now achieved $50 million of cross-selling revenue since the merger. At this point, I think it's clear that we've exceeded the expectations set for both cross-selling between LoopNet and CoStar customer basis, and we've exceeded the initial expectations for cost synergies that could be created by combining the 2 companies. So it's taken us about 20 months since the close of LoopNet to get to this $50 million cross-selling point. And at this point, we feel that it's going to be a little more difficult to accurately report on this number and it will become a little less meaningful, so we're going to stop reporting on the cross-selling number going forward. So at $50 million, we're no longer counting. The commercial real estate recovery is continuing. 2013 was one of the best years for commercial real estate since 2007, as measured by the fundamentals of demand, occupancy and rent growth. For example, in 2013, real estate net absorption of the 4 principal real estate sectors tracked by CoStar increased by more than 30% versus 2012. This absorption supported broad-based, above-inflation rent growth ranging from 1.9% for retail to 4% for industrial. And we continue to see capital flow into real estate investment, as sales of commercial property ran 19% higher last year than in 2012. In fact, at $439 billion in property sales, 2013 had the highest sales volume since 2007. Net absorption of office space was up 24% in 2013 to 59 million square feet. A post-recession record 64% of office submarkets recorded vacancy declines in the fourth quarter of 2013, which is a very important indicator that the broad geographical base of commercial real estate is improving and is showing good fundamentals. And I think that is probably one of the single most important indicators. Strong apartment sector fundamentals allowed vacancies to remain near-record lows at just 4% as of year end. For 2013, apartment net absorption expanded 29% over net absorption 2012. Clearly, increased job growth and reduced homeownership rates continue to boost apartment demand. A doubling in the amount of new construction has provided alternatives for tenants, and the near future will probably lead to a period of slightly rising vacancies. In many respects, the industrial sector is the healthiest of the property types because it benefits from technological changes, in particular, e-commerce and limited new supply. Net absorption of industrial space was 37% higher in 2013 than in 2012 and allowed the sector to achieve one of the highest demand growth rates among the 4 major property types. Retail sales are now up by more than 13% from 2006's peak levels, driving up retailer profitability and encouraging new store openings. While the market remains plagued by empty retail space in higher-quality standards, landlords have been able to push rents aggressively. In short, 2013 was a good year for retail. All in all, all the sectors appear to be giving us a favorable environment for a successful 2014. All this valuable intelligence on what is occurring in commercial real estate markets is only made possible by the insightful dedicated efforts of our more than 1,200 commercial real estate researchers, economists and software developers supporting their work. Over the course of 2013, that team kept CoStar firmly positioned as the leading commercial real estate research organization in the world. They conducted 5.4 million research calls, drove 1.6 million miles inspecting properties, captured 719,000 new listings, added 1 million new tenants, and in total, made 31 million updates to our market coverage. Turning now to the United Kingdom. We entered the U.K. in 2003 with a purchase of a small commercial real estate company called FOCUS, and I believe its corporate name was Property Intelligence. Over the several years that followed, we acquired several more small companies in the United Kingdom and France. None of these companies had sophisticated software nor did they have comprehensive or adequate information. Our first challenge was to cost-effectively research the U.K. market so we could deliver comprehensive current and accurate information on the U.K. market. We initially acquired a small U.K. research team with only a dozen-or-so researchers based in an extremely high-rent-area, Central London. This group was only tracking a fraction of the market, with about 25,000 commercial listings in the U.K. With that spotty coverage of the market, the service was not considered an indispensable utility to our clients. We estimated we needed over 100 researchers to track the market properly. In order to do this cost-effectively, we closed our London research center and opened a much larger research center in Glasgow, Scotland, ultimately employing over 150 researchers there. Under the leadership of Simon Law, our U.K. Director of Research, the team took our database from 25,000 listings to over 156,000 listings, so a 6x increase. And we believe that is the most comprehensive coverage the U.K. market ever built. Despite achieving recognition from our clients for now delivering high-quality research for the U.K., until recently, we were still delivering that data through the old, unsophisticated software solutions we had initially acquired. In 2011 through to the beginning of 2013, a large international team of software developers, led by Jason Butler, Vice President of Software Development, modified our successful U.S. CoStar software solution to handle the U.K. data model, and we migrated the U.K. data into our successful CoStar software environment. Our plan is to upsell existing subscribers to the new enhanced platform with an average price increase that we're seeing of approximately 37%. In addition, we believe the new service has greater appeal to new customer segments such as owners, banks and others, which should accelerate our acquisition of new customers. In fact, we are seeing owners and banks sign up at about 3x the rate we historically were picking up in that sort of segment since we released the new software. During the course of 2013, 386 U.K. firms upgraded or purchased our new U.K. CoStar platform, and that -- those subscriptions are covering 2,000 users. One of our more notable transactions in 2013 U.K. was our multiyear contract with the largest surveyor in the U.K., CB Richard Ellis. Revenue growth has accelerated in the U.K. and in fact, it increased 5.5% from Q3 in 2013 to Q4 in 2013. As we completed the enhancement of our U.K. database and the migration into our CoStar Suite platform, our costs in the U.K. fell dramatically. And in the fourth quarter of 2013, the U.K. was profitable, with $781,000 EBITDA at a 14.1% EBITDA margin. Congratulations to the U.K. team. Giles Newman, the Managing Director who leads CoStar in the United Kingdom; Matthew Green, our Finance and Operations Director in the U.K. and their full teams have done an outstanding job that have made CoStar the clear #1 provider in the U.K. 97 of the top 100 brokerages in the United Kingdom subscribe to one of our services now. We have thousands of client firms potentially upsell in the U.K. in addition to many completely new prospects. We anticipate significant revenue growth in the U.K. for some time to come. Our results in the U.K. clearly demonstrate that the CoStar business model can be successfully implemented internationally. And with that, let's turn to Toronto. With our successes in the U.K. now freeing up a little bandwidth to allow us to focus our efforts up in Canada, we're now focused on beginning to deliver that product and bringing the Canadian operations into profitability as soon as possible. After 2 years of research in the Toronto market and building a database of 60,000 properties, I'm pleased to announced that we're beginning to sell CoStar services covering Toronto. I recently spent time up there with our local sales team visiting the top 15 firms in the market. The feedback we received was overall very, very positive, very welcoming. In half of my meetings, clients asked why it had taken so long to bring the product to Toronto. I didn't really have a great answer. Many have had U.S. associates call over the years and asked for the CoStar reports for Toronto, which they could not deliver. While it's still very early on, we have had a number of significant prospects indicate buying interest, and we're now actively negotiating contracts with multiple brokerage firms. I believe that there is great potential for decades of profitable growth in Toronto and Canada overall. As we discussed in earlier conference calls, we invested throughout 2013 to build a much larger direct field sales force throughout the U.S. We believe that we can deliver higher levels of profitable growth with a larger sales force. We believe that the size of the opportunity we're addressing and enjoy right now requires a larger field sales force to fully capture it and get the value that we have here. It takes 6 months to a year for a new sales person to become fully productive, so in the short term, sales force growth reduces EBITDA. In addition, the lower productivity of new sales people and higher initial training requirements to these sales people temporarily reduces our per-salesperson productivity across the board. It actually causes a little bit of dip in the existing established salespeople's productivity. And we've seen this several times in the past when we grew. Salespeople with 3 months of experience tend to generate approximately $10,000 in gross annual recurring revenue bookings each month. By the time a new sales person is in his or her 12th month with the company, the monthly production number typically climb to approximately $14,400 per month. A fully trained field sales AE with several years of experience typically produces significantly more at $30,000 per month. In the beginning of the first quarter 2013, we had 124 field sales reps in the U.S; by July 2013, we had 140; and by year end, we had 212. That's an increase of 71% over the course of the year and really quite significant. This is the largest field sales force we've ever had in place. In order to provide optimal management support to this larger sales force, we added 10 senior sales managers with relevant backgrounds from great companies such as Thomson Reuters, JLL, PR Newswire, ADP, LexisNexis, PayCheck, EMC, Informa, XO Communications and others. The hiring of these individuals, reconfiguration of sales territories and building a stronger sales management team was indeed a temporary disruption, particularly in the second half of 2013. But we believe it was necessary to ensure long-term growth. I am proud of the commitment to excellence our sales force delivered during this time, and they did so while producing solid top line growth. We recently held our annual sales conference, and the positive energy in the room was really great. We are really excited about the upcoming year. With our larger sales force and new sales territories, we plan to drive sales at a more local level, which we believe will increase sales and increase retention rates, if you have to worry about that at 93%, 94%. It will take some time for our new sellers and sales management to come fully up to speed, but I expect to see the full impact of the recent growth in the sales force and our net new numbers as we get into the later part of the year and into 2015. We launched 5 CoStar products enhancements in the fall of 2013. These enhancements included new lease analysis tools, mobile analytics, enhanced web analytics, a new map search and comprehensive multifamily information. On LoopNet, we released a new advertising opportunity brokers can use to reach prospective clients that are likely searching for properties on LoopNet. Since our October 2013 release, our clients have successfully executed 28 million searches on the new CoStar Suite, and they have built over 11,000 lease financial models in the new CoStar lease analysis tool. We continue to be very pleased with the positive reaction we are receiving to the product. One important area of success I want to highlight, though, in this new release is the new multifamily or apartment information analytic tool we released. We have been collecting partial information on apartment properties for decades now. Now with this new release, we have dramatically increased the breadth and depth of coverage. One of our most experienced research executives, David Porter, has led a team of several dozen researchers, assisted by over 100 field researchers and a number of overseas researchers, on a multiyear effort to build the premier information source on U.S. multifamily properties. We believe that we have built, by far and away, the most comprehensive database of apartment buildings ever assembled. We now have information on 326,000 apartment buildings, representing more than 17.5 million apartment units. With those words, competitors are out hiring researchers trying to catch up. We have hundreds of thousands of images, details on construction type and quality, amenities, unit mixes, rents, sales prices, asking prices, concessions and more. We are also tracking details on 0.75 million of apartment units that are proposed or under construction currently. We believe we have information on 740% more properties than the second closest information provider and 25 -- 24x more properties than the #6 player in that space. U.S. multifamily properties have an aggregate value of approximately $2 trillion. We believe this is a very important component of commercial real estate and an area we have not historically fully addressed. We believe there are very significant revenue opportunities that could be achieved by meeting the full information and marketing needs of the multifamily industry. In the same way CoStar has successfully met the information needs of the office, industrial and retail real estate industries, we believe we can additionally meet the needs of the multifamily industry. We've been meeting some of their needs, but we believe we can meet a much broader set of their needs. The same way CoStar Group has shown through BizBuySell, Lands of America, LoopNet and other marketplaces that we can meet the marketing needs of the office, retail, industrial, business for sale, land and farm brokers, we believe we can meet the needs of multifamily leasing agents. We began making significant investments in this area several years ago, and we'll continue to do so. Since we released the enhanced multifamily service in October 2013, clients have executed 800,000 multifamily-specific searches and users have viewed close to 1 million detailed pages on multifamily properties. Client surveys suggests that our multifamily enhancements were the most popular element of our fall product enhancements. We intend to execute aggressively on additional product initiatives in 2014 to capture what we believe are very significant revenue opportunities in providing multifamily information and marketing services. Our marketplace products are some of our fastest-growing product offerings, and we're delivering product enhancements in this area as well, too. I mentioned the broker advertising opportunities we just released. This is basically with large audiences of people coming to our website, looking to potentially lease or buy properties, our broker clients are interested in presenting ads to these people, offering their services to help them with that process. We've just released this and we've begun selling it. We're having some good success, and we hope to be able to report more on that next quarter. Over the last 6 years, we've accumulated an enormous amount of experience, building, running and growing marketplaces. In fact, we run the top 3 commercial real estate marketplaces in the industry. We also run the top marketplaces for businesses for sale and farms for sale. With LoopNet.com, we operate the clear #1 commercial real estate marketplace in the United States. Since the close of the acquisition at the end of April 2012, we've really reinvigorated LoopNet and it's growing stronger than ever before. LoopNet.com draws by far the most traffic in commercial real estate, with an average of 4.8 million monthly unique visitors. This is up 37% from 3.5 million monthly uniques back just before the acquisition closed. In that time, we grew the number of registered LoopNet users almost 40%, from 5.8 million to 8.1 million. In the 20 months since the close of the LoopNet transactions, we have increased revenue for Premium Lister 38%, and that stands in stark contrast compared to the 8% growth for the 20 months prior to the acquisition. So it's one of our faster-growing areas now in the company overall. The LoopNet acquisition also gave us the second most trafficked commercial real estate marketplace called CityFeet. And that joins our original marketplace, SHOWCASE, which is now #3. So we've built the first, second and third ranked marketplaces for commercial real estate on the web based on site traffic and likely, revenue. We also own and operate several industry-leading marketplaces in other verticals. Lands of America, Land and Farm are #1 and #3 industry sites for rural land based on revenue and clients. They are the #2 and #3 sites by traffic and are showing strong growth in that area. In 2013, total visitors increased 20% and 41%, respectively, for each site. Land and Farm now averages 1 million monthly visitors, while Lands of America has 1.5 million average visitors. 2013 revenue grew 17% for Lands of America over 2012 revenue. And revenue for Land and Farm grew 18% over 2012 revenue. Our industry-leading business marketplace verticals are BizBuySell and BizQuest. They facilitate the sale of small businesses and are the #1 and #2 websites in this important space. In 2013, BizBuySell grew total visitors by 27% year-over-year, with an average of 1.2 million monthly visitors. Total leads delivered to business sellers grew by 25% year-over-year. BizQuest grew monthly total visitors 48% year-over-year, and total leads delivered to business sellers increased by 31% year-over-year. In 2013, we've averaged over 9 million unique monthly visitors in aggregate for all of our sites. Our marketplaces add to the depth and breadth of our offering and add large communities of users who come to CoStar. This increases the network effect and allows for enormous cross-selling opportunities, which we believe lead to high sustainable growth. 2013 was our most successful year yet. We believe we're in an excellent position to maintain mid-teens revenue growth while expanding margins for the foreseeable future. We expect the introduction of new services, especially in the apartment sector, enhancements to our existing services, continued growth and development of our sales force, as well as the strength of the commercial real estate recovery, will create an even more successful 2014. We continue to believe that we are on our way to reaching our goal of $800 million in revenue, with 40% margin as we exit 2017. I will now reluctantly turn the call over to our CFO, Brian Radecki, who will do a fantastic job running through the numbers.
Brian J. Radecki: Thank you, I think, Andy.
Andrew C. Florance: I was more inclined to keep talking.
Brian J. Radecki: I know. Yes, that was tough. I'm pretty impressed, Rich, you kept it under 3 hours. So as mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2013. CoStar's information analytic and marketing services continue to show strong revenue growth, and the successful integration of LoopNet continue to be a big contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings. EBITDA margins continue to expand, driven by mid-teens revenue growth. Today, I'm going to principally focus on the year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter of 2013, and then also on our outlook for 2014 and beyond. Starting with CoStar Group's results for the fourth quarter of 2013, the company reported $115.6 million of revenue, an increase of 15.5% compared to $100.1 million last year. Full year revenues were $440.9 million, an increase of $91 million or 26% over revenues of $349.9 million for 2012. This revenue growth is driven by the core information service performance and the continued progress on cross-selling the LoopNet efforts, as well as strong revenue from the marketplaces. EBITDA increased 54% year-over-year to $31.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013, up from $20.5 million in the prior year. EBITDA for the 12 months ended 12/31/2013, was $94.2 million, which is an increase of 56% or $34 million from EBITDA of $60.2 million in Q4 of 2012. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $40.8 million for Q4 2013, which is an increase of $15.7 million or approximately 63% compared to $25.1 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased significantly to 35.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. You want me to repeat that, Rich?
Richard Simonelli: [indiscernible]
Brian J. Radecki: Okay. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased significantly to 35.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. So when you look at the flow-through from incremental revenue down to earnings, one can sort of understand what happened here and how significant the earnings leverage is in our business. I think we've talked about this for years, but if you think about that flow-through, it is fairly significant. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $12.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share, which is an increase of $8.1 million from $4.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $22.2 million or $0.78 per diluted share, which is a 76% increase from $12.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share from the fourth quarter of 2012. Amazing. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA or any of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms in our press release issued yesterday and are available on our website at www.costar.com, or you can just email richsimonelli@costar.com if you have questions. Cash and investments increased $33.3 million to $277.9 million as of December 31, 2013, up from $244.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2013. Cash and investments exceeded total short- and long-term debt of $153.1 million as of December 31, 2013. Cash flow from operating activities was very strong at $35.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and was $108.3 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2013, which demonstrates, again, the strong cash flow characteristics of our business model. So $108.3 million of cash flow from operations. Phenomenal. At this point, I'm going to give some additional color on a few metrics that highlight the strong performance in the fourth quarter. We achieved $15.8 million in net new sales of subscription services on annual contracts in the fourth quarter as a result of the ongoing success of driving sales of information, analytics, marketplaces and lead generation, all coupled with the successful cross-selling efforts. This represents a 46% increase in net new sales of subscription services on annual contracts compared to the $10.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2012. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was $87.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 or 75.3% of our total revenue, up from only 72% a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December 31, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $326.9 million, up 21% from $271.2 million for last year. At this point, approximately 75% of our revenue is coming from annual subscriptions, and the remaining 25% is primarily made up of our marketing services, including LoopNet premium memberships on monthly or quarterly arrangements, along with CoStar Showcase, as well as revenue from advertising across both platforms. As we continue to make progress upselling LoopNet subscribers' onto annual contracts, we expect to increase the amount of revenue included in our subscription annual metric. The renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained high during the fourth quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar subscription-based revenue was $93.1 million in Q4 of 2013, as this metric ticked down slightly, as expected, from $93.3 million in the prior quarter. As we've discussed for a few quarters now, as we continue to introduce more LoopNet contracts into our subscription base, we'll expect this 12-month trailing renewal rate to edge down slightly. The small decline to date is about what we expected, and we do expect to continue to see it move down a little bit, a percent or 2, over the next few years as we get more and more people signed up for annual contracts. And then, eventually, that will turn around and it will start to increase. Renewal rates for CoStar subscribers who have been with us for 5 years continues to be strong at 98% and pretty consistent for the past several quarters. As Andy discussed earlier, we continue to see great progress on cross-selling LoopNet and CoStar services. Through the end of 2013, total cross-sells were $46.8 million, and earlier this month, we achieved $50 million, as noted in our press release. I think we've clearly demonstrated that the revenue synergies from this acquisition have been a powerful growth catalyst for the business and exceeded expectations and will continue to be for years to come. I believe that progress selling into the LoopNet lead list will continue to be evident in the sales and revenue numbers we report moving forward. At the end of 2013, we had 379 total sales reps, a modest increase from 355 at the end of 2012. Today, our total sales reps in the field, sort of core field sales reps, as Andy mentioned, is 212. We have 109 inside reps, 14 in the U.K. and a handful supporting the various subsidiaries. On previous calls, we've talked about how we're going to be pushing to make the move to get more people selling in the field. As Andy noted, we're making great progress expanding that core field sales team, which is now 212. We started 2013 with 124 core field sales reps, which does not include inside sales, ad sales, HQ AE or trainees and et cetera. Therefore, we increased our core field sales reps by 88 people or 71% in the past year, with the majority in the last few quarters. Including the impact of sort of normal turnover, as of the end of the year, about half our reps had been with us less than a year. As Andy noted, we've also added about 10 new managers to our team to support the growth in sales territories. We're now very focused on training and developing all these new managers and sellers and bringing them up the productivity curve as quickly as possible. As Andy mentioned, it would take 6 to 12 months to bring a new rep up to historical productivity levels. So essentially, half our sales force with experience is training the other half, which is brand-new. Therefore, while we're training and developing these reps, I would expect to see sales trends in the first half, and then sales metrics in the first half of 2014 to be somewhat lower than prior year, and then begin to ramp up in the second half of the year and into 2015 as we reach full productivity increases. This expected lower productivity in the first half of the year, while ramping into the second half of the year and into 2015, is factored into my revenue guidance range. Throughout the year -- and last year, we continue to deliver solid sales numbers while undergoing this transformation. And I expect to see solid sales numbers and strong returns from these efforts as we start moving into the back half of the year. I'll now discuss outlook for the first quarter and full year. Our guidance takes into account all these trends, growth rates, renewal rates, which may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate and the overall economy, among other things. The guidance takes -- our guidance on the impact in foreign currency exchange fluctuations on the top line remains consistent. We do not attempt to predict foreign exchange rates or fluctuations and our guidance assumes little or no volatility to the current rates. Actual results may vary from these estimates. We're providing outlook reflecting our current expectations as of today, February 20, 2014. We expect revenue for the first quarter 2012 to be in the range of $116 million to $118 million. And for the full year, we expect revenues of approximately $490 million to $498 million. In calls last year, I discussed our plans to deemphasize or discontinue certain redundant services, which we expect to have an impact in 2014 of approximately $10 million to $12 million, which is included in my revenue and earnings guidance for the year, so we've taken that into account. In terms of earnings, we expect a first quarter 2014 fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.62 to $0.66 based on 28.6 million shares. For our business, the first quarter expenses include seasonally higher costs related to our annual sales conference, annual standard increases for personnel as well this year, planned investments in marketing and branding in the first half of the year. If you look back over the past decade, you'll see typically our earnings decline from Q4 to Q1 in most years due to these seasonal expenses that are typically incurred in the first quarter followed by increases in earnings and margins in subsequent quarters. We currently assume a 38% tax rate in order to approximate a long-term effective corporate tax rate, which I believe was 37.5% last year. For the full year 2014, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.92 to $3.02 based on 28.8 million shares. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest on improving our service, marketing, branding initiatives as we discussed earlier and further evolving our sales force throughout the year. In the middle of 2012, shortly after the LoopNet acquisition, I introduced the financial goal of achieving $500 million run rate by Q4 2014 with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low to mid-30s, which would have included essentially mid-teens growth rate. The revenue and earnings ranges I shared today highlight that we fully expect to meet and possibly beat these goals. I think there's a little doubt in that. In summary, I'm very pleased with CoStar's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, which clearly shows strong revenue growth and margin expansion and cash flow. We believe the company's operating in a market with a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity potential and we're focused on executing our plan to capture that opportunity. We also remain confident and focused on the longer-term goal I shared with you last year of doubling the business again over the next 5 years and continuing our mid-teens revenue growth to $800 million in annualized revenue run rate exiting 2017 at even higher margins in the 40-plus percent range. We believe the size of the market opportunity, our position in that, our competitive mode [ph], platforms, strong cash flow and management team execute on that goal and take advantage of this massive opportunity. As always, I look forward to sharing the progress with you in the coming quarters and I'll now open it up for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Couple of questions. First of all, and I appreciate the success you've had with LoopNet cross-sell and the fact that it's no longer quite as relevant as a call-out metric. But it looks like we've got some nice acceleration in the fourth quarter. Are you still thinking about the potential LoopNet cross-sell in the same context that you have before somewhere between $120 million and $150 million opportunity, has anything changed in that regard?
Andrew C. Florance: No. It still remains a massive cross-sell opportunity. In fact, December was an unusually high month of CoStar property subscriptions, I mean really surprisingly so. I mean, there's lots of different revenue drivers in the business, but if you look at a chart of new CoStar subscribers on the information side month by month, December stuck out -- stood out like Everest. So it's not going away, it's still there. We still have 50,000 to 100,000 people to try to sell our information who are not yet buying CoStar property or suite. So that remains a very important audience for us to sell to. Conversely, we're also very focused on selling the LoopNet marketing to the CoStar audience. But as a metric now, it sort of refers back the acquisition, and I want to get the sales people a little more focused on total revenue, not on a metric around an acquisition. So I'm just trying -- and then also, it's 2 -- it's a metric that's driving sales force behavior in a way that I think we want to pull them back from a little bit.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: So I assume some of the LoopNet cross-sell strength was reflected in the good net new growth against what was a pretty tough comp versus the third quarter?
Andrew C. Florance: That's 100%, correct.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And with regard to the '14 revenue growth guide, I appreciate call it 200, 300 bps of headwind from some of these discontinued legacy LoopNet solutions on one hand. On another hand, it sounds like you've got a bolus of new sales people that should really become much more productive as the year goes on, perhaps as early as sort of late 2Q, early 3Q, following their ramp, could we expect CoStar to grow above trend line at some point -- for some period of time, because you've got a lot of new sales people, as you noticed, you are probably below trend-line productivity right now.
Andrew C. Florance: They are below trend-line productivity. Like, well, they're where we expect them to be, which is below trend-line productivity. And their productivity over the next 2 or 3 years can grow typically 300%. And then again, I was looking at a chart last night that shows when we add a large number of new sales people to the mix, the existing sales people who act as mentors also come down a little bit. So I would expect them to begin to pick up their productivity as we move into the second, third and fourth quarter. But even if they pick up their productivity in the third quarter, those are bookings that's not going to really move the dial meaningfully on the revenue side. So, I mean, sure, I look forward to the point at which they are beginning to take effect, but we've been through this 2 or 3x in the past as we grew from 10 to 30 and then we went from 30 to 70 and from 70 to 120. Each time we do that, you put that expense out there, some anxiety around the 2 quarters where you're not seeing an immediate return and then you begin to see a new higher level of production. And I'd just stick with what we already talked about and stay reasonably conservative.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, and I think, just to add onto that, to answer your question simply, the answer is yes. I think as you exit '14 into '15, I think we're setting up the back half of this year, at the end of the year and going into '15 I think should be a strong year. And obviously, each quarter, we're going to be reporting on the sales force and sort of productivity. As far as I said, if you look at it, the majority of sales force was ended -- or added sort of toward the tail half of last year. We actually at the sales conference, we're talking to people that actually had not started yet but came to the sales conference anyways. So I think the reality is you're going to spend the majority of the first half of this year with all your experienced people training all the other half of the sales force which is inexperienced. So I feel really good about it as we exit this year -- yes, as you exit this year and you go into '15, I definitely think we should be seeing increasing growth rates there, so I feel pretty good about it.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: That helps a lot. And maybe just a quick housekeeping question, perhaps for Rich, can you tell me the number of subscription client sites you had at your end?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, Rich.
Richard Simonelli: Good question.
Andrew C. Florance: I'll put you on the spot, Rich.
Richard Simonelli: It's about 20,000.
Brian J. Radecki: 22,838.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: 22,838.
Brian J. Radecki: I just -- off the top of my head.
Operator: And next, we will go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: You, Brian, in your sort of long-term outlook and, Andy, you mentioned this to the doubling the $800 million number, one of the questions we get a lot is can you give us a little bit more color on the total addressable market so that we can feel comfortable how you all get there. And you've addressed pieces of this over time, multifamily and et cetera. Could you just give us a quick tour through the addressable market and the rough sizes as you see them or whatever color you can give us on that so we have sort of a holistic view on that.
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. I'll give you something I was looking at last week, which is a slightly nerdy answer to your question but we took -- I took longer-term revenue trends for Washington, L.A., Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, just a number of sort of prototypical markets for us. And I look and I took those revenue streams, the subscription revenue streams and LoopNet revenue streams and I divide that revenue by the number of people in the particular city we are serving with that revenue stream. And then I set the starting point not to a calendar date but to quarter 1, quarter 2, quarter 3, quarter 4, and then did a polynomial regression on the revenue growth path of those different cities. And it's really quite amazing. So like if you look at Los Angeles, it grows at 0.004 x squared, which x is the quarter that's you're in as a revenue per person and population. So we're reaching and -- and our score on that is 0.994, and you get basically a 0.94 on Washington the same way. So you get a really tight, really tight sort of polynomial on these revenues and you get exactly the same formula on several of these older markets. So what's that mean? That means that Washington is now generating about $4 per person per year in the population. And a newer market like a Charlotte might be doing $1 or $2 per person per population, but it's following the exact same curve. Now if I take all the markets, if I take all the markets which range from very young like Toronto, which is -- we may have a contract at this point, which would make it day 0, and an oldest market like Washington D.C., and you just accelerate them on this curve. You take where they are and accelerate on this curve, it implies a market size of $2.4 billion in revenue in 2024, which is really quite optimistic. But that's basically just an empirical analysis of a very consistent long-term market-by-market trend. So the longer we are in a market, the more revenue per person in the population we're getting in, perhaps there's some Metcalfe's Law operating there. Perhaps we are creating more opportunities for people to earn brokerage commissions by making their business more profitable. A lot of different ways you can analyze that. So that, for me, I can give you a hypothetical size of market looking at penetration rates. I can say, gosh, we're 16% penetrating to brokers. We're probably, I'm guesstimating, 4%, 5% penetrated to owners, I could say. And obviously, we have the biggest players in these markets. We have all the CBREs and the JLL's and the top retail owners and so on and so forth. But there are still 100,000-plus people who make a living in -- 100,000-plus firms that make a living each and every day around commercial real estate that are not yet our customers that we believe will become our customers. And for the 150,000-plus who are our customers today, there is no shortage of additional products and services we believe we can sell these people. So if you ever are suffering from really debilitating insomnia, I would invite you to come spend some time with me and we can run some polynomial regressions against our historical revenue trends because they're really, really quite predictable.
Brian J. Radecki: As Andy goes to come up for air, I'll add about 30 seconds to it and I'll keep it short. But I think that when you look at the fact we're approaching, essentially with my guidance close to $500 million of revenue this year, and you go back to something he said at the end, where we have the charts and our slide deck that shows you what percent for brokers, single digit for owners, single digit for retailers, everybody else, you're just -- you're sort of basically looking at the overall market as less than 10% penetrated. If you're already doing $500 million, you're already selling into all those, obviously 10% in the $500 million gives you a $5 billion market. And then that's for the products and services we have today, with the people we know about already selling into those groups. So it's not fictitious numbers or we're not selling into these groups, it's what we're doing today. And then, of course, if you said globally it's 2 to 3x that, obviously, we'll be plucking off Toronto and again slowly over a couple of decades, we'll pluck off other cities internationally, you can multiply that by 2x to 3x. And to me that's the opportunity with the sort of where we are today and then, of course, you know we like to do things to expand that opportunity. So we have no, in my view, that's the very simplistic way I look at it. There's no shortage of opportunity at $500 million, I think to get to $1 billion or $2 billion over the next decade, 2 decades is very reasonable. It won't even approach half of what the opportunity is today here in the U.S. and where our platform is today. And, of course, you could always multiply that globally. So that's sort of my 1 minute add on to Andy's?
Andrew C. Florance: And intuitively, typical information is about 1% of new asset class and you can say global commercial property is approximately $50 trillion. And you can do the math from there and it will clearly indicate that the size of the market opportunity is larger than our current meager revenues.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And one follow-up question, on field sales, you mentioned a bunch of different numbers, Brian, on the field sales, what it was, what it is. What I'm trying to get to is if the average person who's 3 months in, Andy, I think you said is $10,000 in bookings a month and goes over, call it, 3 years, whatever the number is, to $30,000 of bookings a month. And I'm trying to do the math right where I can multiply that times. Are there 50 people who are sub-3 months in the field sales?
Brian J. Radecki: No, I think 80 or 90. If you look at it, I'll give you the numbers again. We have 212 sort of core field reps today. It was versus 124 last year so if you apply a modest turnover to the 124, you figure out we're at 212 now, essentially half our sales force has been here, has experience, and half is in the first quarter or 2. So that will ramp up over the next. Like I said, as you start to get through the back half of this year, and then I think we should be going into 2015 with a fairly strong ramp on the sales productivity. And then, of course, that will continue to ramp through '15 and into '16. So I think the increase in size of the sales force will really carry us through the back half of this year and then through '15 and '16. And I think there's plenty of opportunity for upside with the productivity in the sales force. Obviously, the better job we can do to get them up to speed faster, the better the numbers can be.
Andrew C. Florance: I just want to give you the exact formula. It is revenue per person to population equals 0.0004 x squared where x is the quarter, how many quarters you've been in the market, and then there's an [indiscernible] adjustment, which is not really relevant.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So a couple of questions for you. On the $10 million of sunsetting [ph] of the old products, should we just, I mean, obviously on an annual basis, you back that out from the base of 13, and that gives you about a 14% to 16% growth rate for 2014. But should we think about that being just spread ratably across the quarters, $2.5 million a quarter or are you going to give us an adjustment each quarter?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean, I think it just spread throughout the year. I'm not going to keep -- I think I probably won't talk about it the rest of the year, I mean I think we sort of gave you -- I prepped everybody last year, I gave it you guys this quarter. Now we'll just move forward. It's spread pretty ratably. I mean essentially what it is, is we have 0 people in our sales force selling 2 or 3 or 4 different products that we believe are redundant. So those will just sort of burn off throughout the year. These are monthly and quarterly contracts that have high churn, they're old stuff that's redundant, so I'm obviously not going to talk much about it but it will be spread pretty much throughout the year.
Richard Simonelli: And only that these products are not just redundant, these products are products that are -- we provide -- we feel they provide less value to the customer and they are -- have a substitution effect against higher-priced, more valuable products to the customer.
Brian J. Radecki: On annual contracts.
Andrew C. Florance: We believe all these revenues we give up this year comes back in later time periods with a better client relationship, higher renewal rates at a higher price point.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. Now can we think about having some EPS drag as well over those products that were basically not contributing a lot to the bottom line?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. And I basically factored all that in and I factored both the revenue and the earnings in my guidance, so I think it's pretty much now will be spread throughout the year. And I think you won't really see much of it after that.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got it. Now on the selling of the commercial real estate broker advertisements on the LoopNet sites, how should we think about that in terms of potential revenue? I mean how many territories are you thinking about initially? What are you able to charge per month, it seems like it could be significant.
Brian J. Radecki: So depending upon what the client is buying is basically a share of voice, or they're buying a percentage of the searches in a particular ZIP code that they might be interested in. So if you're a New York broker, you might be buying office searches in 10019. So that ranges from a couple hundred dollars a month for some ZIP codes on up to thousands of dollars a month for another ZIP code. You can buy -- in that case, you're buying anywhere from 10% to 100% of the share voice. And the more share voice sold, the price goes up in that particular ZIP code. This is, I believe, this is comparable to the main revenue drivers for a Zillow or Trulia or a Move. So I believe that this is something that has well over $100 million of revenue potential. It is only a handful of people in our sales force who are selling it today. We are basically opening up the software and providing the basic training required to the rest of the sales force to begin to enable them to sell it. And then we'll be looking at selling it from inside sales teams as well. So it will take us probably 6 months to really get this ramped up to everyone selling it and folks beginning to figure out what their particular sales pitch is around the particular product.
Andrew C. Florance: And to add a little color to that, Bill, so I think that when you look at that sort of funny I looked back at some of these company like Trulia and Zillow, I mean they have like 1 million, 2 million in their first year, 1.5 years. So I have less than 1 million in my model. The fact that we're starting to be -- right now it's basically being tested with a handful of people really won't be fully rolled out, as Andy said, for 6 months or so. Again, I think this is something that comes in the back half of this year where because there -- could there be some upside from that? And the answer is yes, then obviously I would expect in '15, '16, '17, I think this can be a long driver of revenue for years to come.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Now on the sales force hiring, you've had a big surge of hiring and I had a couple of questions there on that. The first is, once you get through this surge, as you kind of think out to 2015, 2016 and beyond, what are you thinking about in terms of how much you'd like to be growing the sales force? And then the other question is have you been looking at hiring some more experienced sales people who would be able to hit the ground running for some of the other segments that you are developing?
Andrew C. Florance: So I believe the -- fairly confident that the rate of addition for the existing core business will absolutely come down, we will not be growing 70% next year, 70% the year thereafter. We'll continue to grow at a slower pace, more measured pace. And while we may be able to hire folks who may have more experience with the advertising side, specifically something like a Trulia, a Zillow, it's more -- our business is fairly unique and there are not a lot of sales people that have experience in what we sell, so unfortunately, there is not a ready pool of folks who know how to sell this particular set of products to this particular audience. It's probably a dozen or so not working for CoStar.
Andrew C. Florance: Bill, just to add a little bit more color to that, too, is that if you actually looked at this, we talked about this pretty extensively last year. We are changing out the plumbing in the hotel while we're still selling the rooms. So we are -- the total sales headcount that I gave you guys is only up 5% or 6%. It wasn't like we added a lot onto the total amount but we have to carefully move them and in a lot of cases, replace it to increase that field sales force, right. And then we talked about this pretty extensively actually for the past 4 or 5 years, so we did that. And if you look at the sales numbers, we are putting up some pretty strong sales numbers. So I think I feel good about -- that was a very careful sort of moving of numbers. So the total sales people, which we went back to the LoopNet acquisition, we said, hey, in total, we have enough, we just don't have them in the right areas. So I think we did a -- I think we did a good job of essentially doing what we told people we were going to do, now we have to get them up to speed. I would like, as we move into '15, '16 and beyond to continue to see the field sales force growing, the core field sales force which is driving the core of the business up, those numbers up 10%, 15%, 20% for years and years to come because of the size of the opportunity. I think obviously we have to swallow this down this year. But again, it doesn't mean the total size of the sales force has to grow that much because I think, again, it's just moving them into the right places. So I feel pretty good about where we're entering this year. And I think by the end of the year, we'll all feel pretty good about the productivity.
Operator: And next we will go to the line of Michael Huang with Needham.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones for you and then we'll wrap this up, hopefully. So I apologize if I missed this, so with respect to Fusion, I was wondering if you can kind of help us understand how Fusion may be impacting ASPs and sales cycles and maybe close rates? And what are your assumptions kind of around how Fusion kind of has been perceived in the marketplace?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. So remember, Fusion, the concept of rehabilitating the overall product suite and eventually integrating a lot of these acquired components into 1 integrated software suite is a multiyear effort. And we think it's probably 5 major product releases each time, putting out 5 major product enhancements is sort of a rough approximation of the way I think about it. And so what we released recently was just round 1. So we've got 20% of the way there, we've got a fair amount of work to go and a number of years to do it. I believe it is short in the sales cycle. I believe it's increasing the close rate. We are still in a mode where we are keeping our pricing somewhat aggressive to trying to get additional share and convert more people in from the LoopNet information side where they were paying pretty much 1/5, 1/10 of what they were paying for the CoStar side. I think it is when you look at the CoStar-property-only renewal rate running in the 94.5% range, something like that, it's -- I think that it is contributing to a higher renewal rate. So when I look at cancellations, it is -- I think it's helping their, which contributes to overall net growth. And more importantly, our clients like it. Our clients are just really quite happy with the product and we feel better about the business when the clients are happy. And I just got one note that someone just slipped into me, we got our first Canadian contract, so JLL just signed up for our Toronto services. So we now have revenue in Canada.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: And just as a final question for me. And I'm not sure if I missed this one, so as you were thinking about LoopNet and some of the cross-sell activity that you saw there, I think in the past maybe you have provided what the close rates were kind of around from the opportunities you were going after, I was wondering how you did, exiting the year given the strong contribution from that and what's your assumption around that going forward?
Brian J. Radecki: I do apologize because I do not have that particular number. What I can guesstimate is that it did continue to track as we thought it would because, again, the surprising -- based upon the surprising increase in CoStar subscriptions in December, it was an unusual number. I cannot believe that the rate did not continue to move upward, so it's probably approaching that 40%. We also invested a lot of -- I mean a lot of time and effort in the third and fourth quarter in training managers and sales people on how to effectively do the cross-selling of LoopNet to CoStar on the information side. So I think that drove the conversion rate up, and I think that's what caused that higher surge in that core -- in the core business in December.
Operator: And next, we will go to the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I guess we're going to get to see Canada operations broken out the next quarter like you do the U.K., Brian. Kind along those same lines, I did have a question about international markets and, Andy, you mentioned potentially more markets eventually in Canada. You talked about the acquisition you'd made in France, I'm just wondering if you can give any more color there about where you might look to go next and when we might expect to hear a definite announcement about that?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. So I would like to see us get to profitability and a respectable margin in Canada dramatically faster than we got to profitability on the new platform in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom, I believe was unusually complex because it's one of the most sophisticated commercial real estate markets in the world and we had 8 little companies we were integrating and that just made the -- and modifying the data model across all of those were a little more complicated. So I think, Canada, will get profitable quicker there. We would like to see the United Kingdom and potentially, Canada, at the 30% margin range before we really consider aggressive additional international expansion. One of the things on future international expansion is we would probably do that expansion in closer alignment with our biggest international customers. So we have conversations from time to time with our biggest international customers about how we might be able to meet their needs on -- their needs to have Internet marketplaces to generate leads for their listings globally. If we were to do a more LoopNet-like product internationally, I believe that is much lower investment cost with a faster return. You can begin to generate revenue in markets, learn the nuances of the markets and then later come in with the more expensive heavy investment commitment CoStar property traditional full information model. So bottom line is do not look beyond Canada, do not look for any sort of EBITDA dilution in the near term from international expansion. You'll see more domestic initiatives -- and significant domestic initiatives. And -- but we want to -- we still want to be able to show the investors the proof point that this is an international business, and that we'll be able to deliver on that promise intermediate term.
Brian J. Radecki: And just to add to that, so I mean, my translation to that is what I have been saying, I think, for the last year or so that over the short term, the next few years, there's no significant international plans but definitely in the 5, 6, 7 year model -- as you get to the bigger models, clearly we're demonstrating this business can do very well internationally, hence the 2x to 3x the current opportunity.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Got you, okay. That's helpful. And then, Brian, you mentioned the high incremental margin on the incremental revenue. I think if I calculated the incremental adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter, it was actually over 100%. Is there anything in particular about 2014 where the incremental adjusted EBITDA margin, we should expect that to be lower than what the potential long-term run rate is?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, so I'll add to this quickly and then I think we'll wrap it up after this question. So yes, I mean, if you look -- I mean, I've got that question, I've always said historically, if you look at our gross margin line, we're actually over 72% now, 72.5%, something like that, it was in the low 60s prior to LoopNet. So each incremental dollar, you pay out a little commissions, you have some costs but essentially, you drop in $0.70 to $0.80 to the bottom line, obviously because of the acquisition over the past 2 years we have been working synergies out in the business though it appears like you're getting over 100%, which is awesome, right. I mean, nobody can argue with that. So I think that this year, and if you look at the long-term, clearly we feel good about the 30% to 35% range we set out last year. And I feel very good about the long-term of being over 40%. We talked about this year in the first quarter, in the first half of the year, if you just look at every year, our EBITDA margins are lower in the first half of the year, than in the second half of the year so I expect them to be where my guided range was for Q1, and then I expect to see them slowly increase throughout the year because obviously we're still investing some piece into the business, it's not a pure 100%. So I don't think I can run at a 100-plus percent forever but I feel pretty good when I -- and I've said it for years, we can drop $0.70 to $0.80 to the bottom line, still invest in the business and really grow this thing. And it goes -- I mentioned that, when you look at the significant growth in that and you look at the significant operating cash flow, this is the business model we operate in and it's unbelievable.

Andrew C. Florance: Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our third quarter 2013 financial results were very strong. Revenue grew to $112 million for the third quarter, a 17% year-over-year increase. Our annualized net new sales of subscription services in the third quarter were $13.7 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year. We added nearly 1,200 new CoStar information subscription customers during the quarter, bringing the total number of new clients to 4,900 over the last 12 months. This represents a 58% increase in the acceleration of new customers compared to the previous trailing 12-month period. EBITDA increased 52% year-over-year to nearly $30 million for the quarter. I think this margin expansion is all the more impressive when you consider that we are investing so aggressively right now into important initiatives that we believe will enable us to sustain these impressive revenue growth rates for many years to come. In prior calls and meetings, we've briefed you on the years of planning our product design development and engineering teams have invested into building next-generation of our flagship product, CoStar Suite and CoStarGo. At times, we refer to this next generation of CoStar as Fusion. We call this next product platform Fusion because it blends our valuable in-depth data, our historical data sets, the power of our subsidiary companies' software and their solutions together with our clients own data. We believe that this next-generation platform moves CoStar into the realm of workflow solutions, decision-support, creates communication channels and yields predictive analytics. We, in turn, believe that this increases the utility of our services, gives us additional competitive advantage and will fuel our long-term growth. The scope of our plans for Fusion is very ambitious, so we intend to build a platform in a series of segmented lower risk product releases over the course of several years. Last week, we launched the first of these planned software releases, with 5 major product enhancements to the CoStar platform. The 5 enhancements include a new map-based interactive search tool based on the popular search tool that we had in our mobile platform, CoStarGo. We've had in-depth coverage of the U.S. multifamily marketplace. We've expanded the property and market analytics capability of the product, and we integrated in a lease valuation and comparison tool. And finally, we released an upgrade to our very popular CoStarGo products, giving it mobile analytics capabilities. The release was first made available in Maryland, Virginia and the District. The release went very smoothly in those areas, so we launched it in the United Kingdom and a few days later, in the Northeastern United States. The release is still progressing very smoothly, and we plan to roll it out to the rest of the country over the course of the next 2 weeks. Initial reaction is positive across the board, and clients' activity in the first phase of our release has been fantastic. In just 10 days, as of about 2 minutes before the call, we solved 1.13 million searches in the platform, and there were almost -- actually not almost, there were 1,030 lease analysis financial models created in basically the first week. So we're very pleased with the level of activity from this limited rollout in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and the U.K. We've met with over 100 firms in the first 10 days in order to understand how clients are reacting to the new product. The following anecdotal feedback gives you a flavor of the sort of feedback we're receiving overall. Tom Edgar of GBR Phoenix Beard in the United Kingdom told us to quote, "The upgraded CoStar Suite has massively improved the user's experience. It now offers an easy to navigate user-friendly interface, which mirrors the fantastic CoStarGo app for iPad and offers great functionality. The extra time spent on further development of the product is clear to see." In order to get a accurate gauge on our clients' reactions to this major product upgrade, we hired an independent third-party market research firm called Market Connections to survey the initial Mid-Atlantic users. They received completed surveys from about 500 clients. They also asked for written comments and most of the respondents gave us valuable feedback. These participants were asked to comment on their of view the features for each of the 5 enhancements and, overall, how the new release compared to the previous CoStar tool. The researchers asked our clients to rate the new features as either not at all appealing, not very appealing, somewhat appealing or very appealing. For simplified reporting, we combined the response somewhat appealing and very appealing into 1 category of appealing as an indication of positive feedback. So the results showed that 93% of the surveys found the new map search appealing, 92% of our response found the new multifamily information appealing, 94% found the new analytics appealing, 93% found the CoStar lease analysis appealing. Finally, 94% of our respondents found CoStarGo analytics appealing. So I would be so bold as to say that sounds like straight As on the release. And in general, over time, I found that people really hate to see any change to software they've grown accustomed to and that they use every day. And for sure, the improvements to the software have to far outweigh the inconveniences you create by changing the software someone's used to using. If you don't, clients in the industry will typically react very negatively to anything other than a really significant improvement of overall functionality. I think with this release, we really have avoided the problem of clients being resistant to the change. On average, only 1.5% of the respondents found that the various enhancements were not at all appealing. That 1.5% negative response was overwhelmed by the average positive response of 93%. So we're running at a 63 to 1 positive on the release. So let's take a closer look at what we are offering with this new release. Real estate's about location. The faster, more intuitive map-based search enables customers to visualize their search results on a map as they build their search. The client sees the search as it happens. This makes CoStar Suite more user-friendly. We believe that this will result in more usage, higher renewals and increased sales. Again, here are some of the quotes from our clients that are useful. From [indiscernible] a REIT analyst of Capital One Securities says, "The maps are just so intuitive. I love having all the search criteria on one page." Patrick McCormick [ph] from Jones Lang LaSalle told us, "The new map features are extremely appealing to me. I'll be able to use them in presentations." Next, we launched our comprehensive coverage of multifamily properties. With information analytics that we believe will increase our penetration with brokers, banks, owners and institutional investors. Multifamily is a $2 trillion asset class in the United States, and clearly, the hottest in commercial real estate. In the past year, over $95 billion of transactions were completed in this section -- sector. We have built a database that far exceeds other firms' multifamily information offerings. We are now tracking information on nearly 300,000 apartment communities, with 5 or more units for a total of 16 million apartments. Our nearest competitor tracks 6 million apartments, so we cover 2 to 3x what they do. We even offer multifamily specific submarkets that provide a greater granularity than any of our competitors. We have lost competitive sales in the analytics arena in the past to competitors because we did not have information on multifamily properties. But what was once our weakness is now our strength. We are capturing information such as building details and quality, effective rents, concessions, occupancy levels, ownership, property sales, unit sizes and mixes, images and many other details. This data can be queried, analyzed in the product to provide valuable analytic information on market trends, give you great reports on what's happening in the marketplace. Trent Smith from Insight Property Group said, "The multifamily data is impressive. My head is spinning with all the possible applications of the multifamily analytic data." Sam Sherwood from Integra Realty Resources told us, "The multifamily detail views are a huge improvement on what was previously available. I particularly like the specialized multifamily submarket geographic definitions." Third, we've added analytics to provide users customizable property and market statistics that give our clients vivid charts and graphs to analyze vacancy rates, rental rates, absorption, leasing activity and more. For example, an owner will be able to compare her building to other similar buildings in the city and can use the data price releases competitively and have a better understanding of the probable amount of time it will take to lease up her buildings' vacancies. Tom [indiscernible] of Cushman & Wakefield says, "I love the new analytics feature, which updates the map as I search new entries." Harold [indiscernible] at CBRE says, "As a research analyst, the new analytics and report capabilities are very helpful in my daily duties. The new layout and capabilities seemed very easy to use and make my job easier and more time efficient." The fourth major and most significant element release is CoStar Lease Analysis. This was made possible by CoStar's acquisition of Resolve several years ago. Without the technology team at Resolve taking the lead, there would be no lease analysis in CoStar Suite today. I believe this is a truly transformational tool. It gives better visibility into the true cost of a lease and we believe, will enable brokers to get a signed lease much more quickly, which is their commissionable event. It is an integrated workflow tool that allows brokers and owners to do intensive lease analysis, incorporating CoStar information with their own data. Rather than manually entering all the data they need to build a financial model for a lease into the spreadsheet, they can now instantly load all the information for CoStar into a prebuilt integrated lease model. This has many benefits, including time savings and accuracy. The user never has to leave CoStar in order to access the tool, build the model, perform the analysis and create client-ready reports. The reality is that many brokers did not do this analysis work before because the work involved, or they hand this work off to an analyst in their back office. CoStar Lease Analysis is not intended to be a back-office tool. Now that it's much easier and faster to build the model that the broker can work -- the broker can now work with their clients face to face, discuss terms and possible scenarios and compare several properties and models side-by-side, real-time. We also believe that brokers negotiating on opposing sides will use the tool real-time with the what-if analysis capabilities as a key negotiating tool. CoStar Lease Analysis allows clients to generate reports that summarize the information for their clients' senior management. These are professional, high-quality board of director reports that take highly complex information and present it in an easy-to-understand document that lets users compare multiple lease options. We believe CoStar Lease Analysis will become the industry standard for the financial analysis of leases. This is just the start for this project genre, and we feel that we have a very robust and promising product roadmap for integrated financial modeling. Again, I think our clients can say it best. William Schwartz of the Meyer Group said, "The lease analysis is amazing. This is the most -- this is more cohesive and easier than ProCalc, plus it's modeled what CoStar data already has, so you have a head start." Elizabeth Harvey at Cresa said, "It's amazing. The presentation output is excellent." Lisa Banusiewicz at Transwestern said, "It is less daunting than ARGUS or even building something simple in Excel. The sensitivity analysis features are very helpful to see what little tweaks need to be made to hit the targets." Mark [indiscernible] at Ackridge [ph] said, "Critical, very important and game changing." Nikki Arena [ph] of Guardian Realty Investors said, "The lease analysis feature is also very cool. It takes a lot of guesswork out of the lease." Fifth, we released CoStarGo 2.0, which is the upgrade for CoStar iPad app. This new version now has customizable analytics, which means brokers can work directly with clients in the field, using powerful property market analytics. So it gives instant insights, charts, graphs, absorption, trends in the market area they're sitting in or anywhere else they want to steer their iPad. Mike Hetchkop at Cresa remarked, "I like the fact that analytics just pop up. I like the ones that come up automatically, so you don't have to create anything, especially because most of the time using CoStarGo on the go and presenting in front of a client." All in all, we're very pleased with the reaction to these enhancements and are optimistic they will have a positive impact on 2014 sales. These products allow our sales force to meet with existing clients to provide an opportunity for more cross-selling of the LoopNet users. Can't help it, I'm going to share just 2 more comments. Jonathan Gardner at Coldwell Banker Elite said, "I just liked the evolution of the interface and what shows as attention of detail from user input. There's obviously strong communication links between the company and its clients, which will keep accounts alive and growing. Very reassuring. I specially like that instead of just sharpening existing tools, the commitment to excellence from CoStar is extended to lease analysis. Usability has reached another level. Thank you." And then Steve Romer, who is president of Westrock Appraisal Services, is one of the smarter guys I know, said, "I have been waiting for this my whole life." Okay, he may be a little over enthusiastic. Okay, so, all in all, a very solid product release and exceeding our expectations. So turning to LoopNet. Through the third quarter 2013, the CoStar sales force has now achieved nearly $36 million of revenue synergies from our acquisition of LoopNet. Through September 30, 2013, we have cross-sold our products between LoopNet and CoStar client bases to over 6,400 real estate firms after completing nearly 19,000 cross-selling demos. As we expected, this is an increase in the close rate to approximately 34%, up from 31% in the second quarter of 2013. I believe we can continue to include -- increase the close rate to trading of our sales force and very valuable technology tools that we're using to assess the selling process. I spoke last quarter of a comparison tool within CoStarGo for our sales force to use of LoopNet users, who think they're seeing the whole market on LoopNet. The tool appears within CoStarGo and demonstrates the CoStar has significantly more listings in a given area than what is available under a user's LoopNet subscription. In addition to that very important tool, we have just launched an automated LoopNet to CoStar upsell tool that appears within LoopNet's website. Once a person -- once one of our sales people demos a LoopNet to CoStar information upsell prospect, we automatically turn on an automated comparison of the results of a CoStar versus LoopNet search every time the prospect searches within LoopNet. So if a LoopNet user, who we think should be using CoStar, goes into Santa Monica and looks for office buildings for sale, it will pop up and will say, there's 30 buildings that answer this criteria in CoStar and there are 15 in LoopNet. If you want to see the whole market, upgrade to CoStar. So this is a very effective way, and those numbers are hypothetical but typical, it's a very effective way to bring home to LoopNet user the clear advantage between the different price point products we offer. So it's a very cost-effective way to say -- stay top of mind with a prospect and convince them that while they need LoopNet for marketing, they need to invest in CoStar to get a professional level information tool and have more information to their client. In the first week, this tool has already resulted in new sales, more appointments and the LoopNet users calling our sales force to buy. After 1 day, one LoopNet user sent the email saying, "Please turn off the pop-up, I'll buy." As we have previously discussed, we're preparing to launch a broker advertising option on LoopNet by the end of the year, enabling brokers to market their services to tenants or buyers looking for properties in areas they specialize in. This will be a completely new revenue source for us, and I expect that it could be quite significant when you consider that on the residential side, companies like Zillow, Move and Trulia earns tens -- they earn tens of millions of dollars annually from similar advertising opportunities for their brokers. I am very pleased with how we continue to grow revenue in LoopNet's Premium Lister product. In the third quarter of 2013, the sequential growth over the second quarter 2013 was 5.6%. Since the quarter -- since the third quarter 2012, we have grown Premium Lister revenue by 25.8%, so it's growing much faster than the business overall. We are also increasing the ratio of paid to free listings in LoopNet. We have increased the number of for lease paid listings all the way up to 49% of total listings, up from just 32% at the point we closed the acquisition. For the for sale paid listings, they're now up to 39%, up from 31% at the time of the acquisition. Membership growth continues to be very robust in LoopNet as we added 360,000 additional registered members in the third quarter, and we now have 7.7 million registered members in total. I think 10 million is coming here soon. We increased Premium Membership Average Revenue Per User of new sales 57% from $56 in the third quarter of 2012 to $88 in the third quarter of 2013. Overall, Premium Membership Average Revenue Per User is up from $66 to $76, which is a 16% year-over-year increase. In the third quarter of 2013, 48% of all premium memberships were sold on an annual basis and 27% were quarterly. The average contract term has gone from 1 month prior to the merger to nearly 7 months now. And the average new LoopNet contract value has moved from $56 as of completion of the merger to over $600 today. Now, I'd like to update you on our activities in United Kingdom. We're making excellent progress in London, as our release of CoStarGo and CoStar Suite has resulted in a strong uptick and sales there. September 2013 was our best ever sales month in the United Kingdom, and we've had 4 of our highest ever sales months to the U.K. during the first 9 months of the year. Today, we have nearly 300 firms subscribed in the CoStar Suite in the U.K. In addition, we've achieved an average of 40% price increases and subscription fees from existing FOCUS subscribers upgrading to CoStar Suite and Go, and nearly 35% of the clients upgrading to Suite and Go have done so on multiyear contracts. We signed some excellent clients in the U.K. in 2013, including Wells Fargo, Standard Life and Europa. Historically, the vast majority of our sales came from brokers in the U.K., but now with CoStar Suite, we're generating a high volume of sales to investors, owners and lenders. CBRE is one of the dozen major brokerage firms in the U.K. and in fact, is the largest of the majors there. CBRE and many of the majors subscribe to our low-end, low-cost legacy U.K. products called FOCUS. The cornerstone of our strategy in the U.K. has been to upsell these brokerage firms on the significant additional value they can gain from our U.K. CoStar suite of products. After 2 dozen meetings with CBRE and a 9-month sales cycle, I am extremely delighted that the leader in the market has made a significant investment by upgrading to a multiyear contract for CoStar Suite. This is a major milestone for us, and it demonstrates that our investments to integrate the U.S. and the U.K. are starting to pay off. We believe it's only a matter of time before other top U.K. commercial real estate firms will follow CBRE's lead in order to not cede a competitive advantage to them. I'd like to briefly update you on what we're seeing in the commercial real estate markets. The markets are continuing to show signs of recovery. Both investor and tenant demand for real estate is currently increasing. Year-to-date, net absorption of office, retail and warehouse space is averaging more than 50% higher than the same period last year, and the department demand alone is up 28%. Furthermore, the third quarter of 2013 had the strongest net absorption so far this year for each property type. We continue to see capital flowing to real estate investment and year-to-date sales of all of commercial property are running 19% higher than 2012. Many formerly distressed suburban office markets such as Orange County, Phoenix, Sacramento and Atlanta have registered over 2 million square feet of net absorption each in the past year. Strong apartment sector fundamentals push vacancies to a record low of 4% in the quarter. This record low vacancy rate is driving 2 trends: First, rent growth is very strong at 5.4% annualized rate. Second, net completions are up more than 150% year-to-date to 186,000 units. The apartment market strength is broadly based and rent has grown by 2% to 8% in nearly every major market. The industrial sector is very healthy overall. Expanding Internet retailers and housing recovery-related demand growth has caused year-to-date industrial net absorption to spike up by 40% compared to the same time last year. It has propelled industrial vacancy to decline by 80 basis points to 8.4%, which is the greatest year-over-year vacancy decline for any of the property types. Retailers are stronger today than they've been in years. In particular, they have mostly shed underperforming stores and have written a rebounded [ph] retail spend into record profits. Retail net absorption has more than doubled from last year. So in conclusion, we're generating exceptional natural results for the first 3 quarters of 2013. We believe that the enhancements to our existing products, the strength of the commercial real estate recovery as well as the continued growth of the size of our sales force positions us to be able to maintain mid-teens revenue growth while expanding margins for the foreseeable future. I believe that this quarter further demonstrates that we're on our way to reaching our goal of $800 million in revenue, with high margin as we exit 2017. Okay. At this point, I will now turn the call over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer, as long as he promises to make no sound effects.
Brian J. Radecki: I promise, Andy, thank you.
Andrew C. Florance: You're welcome.
Brian J. Radecki: As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with the financial performance in the third quarter and year-to-date 2013. CoStar's information, analytic and marketing services continue to show strong revenue growth and the successful integration of LoopNet continues to be a big contributor to the growth in revenue and earnings. EBITDA margins continue to expand, driven by mid-teens revenue growth. Additionally, as Andy discussed, revenue synergies for the LoopNet acquisition continue to ramp up, have increased to $35.8 million since the acquisition. So this is where Andy gets really excited because I get all the points, point this, point that on there. So I'm really excited, so let's talk some numbers guys, right Rich? You're ready? Are you ready?
Richard Simonelli: I'm ready.
Brian J. Radecki: Are you with me? Jon, are you with me?
Jonathan Coleman: I am.
Brian J. Radecki: All right, everyone's with me. All right, here we go. Starting with CoStar's results for the third quarter 2013, the company reported $112.3 million of revenue, an increase of 16.3% or 17% compared to $96 million in the third quarter of 2012. This growth was driven by solid core information services performance, continued cross-selling efforts, as well as impressive growth from the LoopNet marketplace. The third quarter 2013 is the first year that we had a full quarter of LoopNet revenue and a year-over-year comparison. As I discussed, at the time of the acquisition, our 2012 results were impacted by the purchase accounting adjustments included, which reduced LoopNet's deferred revenue. Normalize these adjustments, our year-over-year revenue growth for the third quarter of 2013 remains a strong 15% compared to the third quarter of 2012, or in the mid-teens. More than 75% of the purchase accounting adjustments were recognized in the first 2 quarters last year after the acquisition, so the impact in growth rates in the future is fairly minimal. EBITDA was $29.8 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $19.6 million in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 52%. As we reported, adjusted EBITDA of $37.7 million for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $12.1 million or approximately 47% compared to $25.6 million in the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 33.6% in the third quarter of 2013 from 26.7% in the third quarter of 2012. Our results and these margin results are consistent with what was I think it was our medium or long-term goal but now it's coming closer of achieving $50 million -- $500 million run rate with 30% to 35% adjusted EBITDA margins by the end of 2014. We think it is clear that we are well on our way to these goals, which we've been discussing for a few quarters. I'm happy to note that we achieved the margin goal beginning last quarter, 6 quarters earlier than we expected. While adjusted EBITDA margins may move around a little bit due to timing of marketing and other investments throughout the year, our second and third quarter 2013 result demonstrates the potential for continued strong earnings growth and expanding margins for many, many years. Gross margin was $80.6 million in the third quarter of 2013, up compared to $65.1 million in Q3 of '12. Gross margin percentage was 71.8% in the third quarter of 2013, a 4% increase compared to last year, which is fairly massive. Net income increased to $11.1 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $6.8 million in the third quarter of '12. And non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2013 was $20.2 million or $0.71 per diluted share, which is a 54% increase from the third quarter of 2012. Reconciliation of all non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their GAAP basis results, are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms, on our press release issued yesterday which is available on our website at www.costar.com, or you can just call Rich Simonelli. Cash and investments totaled $244.6 million as of September 30, up $32.8 million -- hold on, $32.8 million from $211.8 million last quarter. Obviously, cash flow remains very strong and cash and investments now are $87 million higher than our total debt of $157.5 million. Obviously, our balance sheet's in great shape. At this point, I'm going to give some additional color on a few metrics that highlight our strong performance in the third quarter. We achieved $12.2 million in annualized net new sales in the second quarter based on our ongoing success of driving our information sales and analytics, also LoopNet's Premium Lister products and our cross-selling efforts. I'd like to point out that this sales number, which is the one -- the older one that we were reporting for years, actually understates our success. As Andy noted earlier, the net new sales of subscription services on annual contracts is higher at $13.7 million, up 47% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The higher sales of annual subscription reflects our efforts to replace the short-term LoopNet agreements with higher-value, longer term agreements. Moving forward, to eliminate any confusion, we're just going to provide the net new sales metrics of annual subscriptions, which we believe is the most important and relevant metric. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was up to $83.8 million for the third quarter 2013 or 74.6% of total revenue, up from 71.2% a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2013, subscription revenue from annual contracts totaled $311.9 million, or up 19% from $261 million for the 12-month trailing period 2013 -- or 2012, sorry about that. At this point, approximately 75% of our revenue is coming from annual subscriptions. The remaining 25% is primarily made up of marketing services, including LoopNet's Premium Membership, which are on monthly or quarterly agreements and CoStar showcase as well as some advertising revenue across both platforms. As we continue to make progress upselling LoopNet's subscriptions to 1-year contracts, we continue to expect the increasing amount of marketing revenue will be included in the subscription revenue metric. The renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained high during the third quarter of 2013. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar's subscription-based services was 93.3% in the third quarter of 2013, as this metric ticked down slightly from 93.7% in the prior quarter. As we've been discussing for the last few quarters, the introduction of more annual LoopNet contracts into our subscription base is expected to cause the 12-month trailing renewal rate to edge down slightly over time. The small decline to date is about what we've expected. We may see that number to continue to move a little bit, a percent or 2, over the next few years. The renewal rate for CoStar subscribers who have been with us for 5 years or longer continued high and remained at approximately 98%. Last quarter, Andy discussed in detail our plans to continue to evolve our sales force. We're continuing to focus on expanding our field sales force, which now includes 190 field sales reps, an increase of 60 from the time of the LoopNet acquisition and we'll continue to add more reps there. Hopefully, we should be over 200 by the end of the year. So now I'll talk about my outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, revenue growth rates, renewal rates, which may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate or the overall global economy. We do not attempt to predict foreign exchange rate fluctuations, so our guidance assumes little to no volatility for the current rate. Actual results may vary from these results. But if you are not sure, call Jon Coleman. Based on continued strong revenue, earnings and margin momentum, and the expectation for continued growth in our core information services and cross-selling initiatives, we're raising both the revenue and earnings guidance for 2013. For the full year, we now expect revenue in the range of $438 million to $440 million, which is a $3 million increase at the midpoint compared to prior guidance. It was consistent with our mid-teens revenue growth we've been discussing. It also accounts for the expected LoopNet marketplace seasonality, which occurs every fourth quarter. Also, due to continued cost and revenue synergies related to LoopNet acquisition and our ability to grow revenue at high incremental margins, we expect 2013 full non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $2.51 to $2.54 based on 28.2 million shares. This is an increase of approximately $0.19 at the midpoint with our prior guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.75 based on 28.4 million shares. As we look forward to Q1 2014, we are extremely excited about the new product enhancements Andy discussed earlier. To support the launch of these enhancements and to drive continued revenue growth in 2014 and beyond, we plan to reinvest some of the benefits of our recent strong performance into sales, marketing and branding initiatives, totaling $0.10 to $0.12. We plan to align these initiatives with selling beginning late Q4 2013, with the majority of the impact happening in Q1 2014. And the Q4 2013 spending is incorporated into my guidance. As we plan for next year, we have a lot of moving parts, which will affect my guidance, including marketing to support the product launches, some decisions about deemphasizing or discontinuing certain services, finishing the back end integration of our databases to gain research efficiencies and completing the buildout of our sales team. Sounds like a lot. Currently, we are in the budget process for 2014, and we believe we can continue to grow both revenue and earnings nicely compared to 2013, while also investing to further build out our platform and sales force to drive long-term growth, not just for 1 year, but for the next decade. Once we finish the budget process, I'll be ready to give out much more detailed 2014 guidance on our next earnings call. Until then, we expect to operate in that 30% to 35% margin range, most of next year, and exiting at the run rate of $500 million of revenue or possibly better. As we move into 2015, '16 and '17, we believe the business will continue to grow and eventually operate in the 40% to 50% margin range. In summary, I'm very pleased with the CoStar financial results for the third quarter of 2013, which clearly showed the strong revenue growth and margin expansion. We continue to believe the company's operating in a multibillion-dollar potential market, and we are focused on executing our plan to capture that opportunity. We also remain focused on a longer term goal, I shared with you earlier this year, of doubling the business over the next 5 years, continuing our mid-teens revenue growth to an $800 million annualized revenue run rate exiting 2017 at even higher margins in the 40% plus range. As our track record shows, we believe we have the size of market, market position, competitive moat, platform, strong cash flow, and management team to execute on our vision and take advantage of this massive opportunity. As always, I look forward to sharing our progress with you on these goals in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Brandon Dobell from William Blair.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Quick one on sales force. First, you mentioned getting over 200. I want to make sure I understand where the 190 -- or how did the 190 I guess looks right now? Are those truly all field sales force people? Are there still some in that number that are kind of hybrid between field and inside? Or if it's not, then, how do the inside sales force stack up right now?
Andrew C. Florance: It's all 100% traditional field now. So they're basically out and -- we designed a new territory structure to handle 220-some territories in the field, responding to where the demand is in the market. And so there's 195 of these territories being filled. And they're not HQ AEs traveling sort of hybrid inside sales. And that -- this is not an insignificant effort. So we have -- we are doubling the number of managers out in the field, and we've been hiring at a pretty good clip there, some internal promotions. And then we also have been conducting the most training, I think, we've ever conducted for our sales force over the last 3 or 4 months. So both LoopNet cross-selling techniques, PL selling techniques, training around the new products and the new financial modeling and then also just bringing in the new folks and new managers and getting them up to speed. For big picture, we're marching towards the goal and it feels pretty good.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, and Brandon, that -- I'm just reiterating what Andy said. The 190 is pure in the field. The overall sales number is over 350, which would include all the other pieces, the verticals, inside sales and all that. So that number continues to move up. We expect it to be over 200 by the end of the year. And again, it's all part of the plan we've been discussing the last few quarters.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then back, Andy, your comments about the kind of the 5 new enhancements, those kinds of new rollouts. Did that impact how you guys are pricing? Did it impact how you guys are looking at what types of customers may make sense [ph]? Just trying to get a feel for other than just the anecdotes about how useful the product is, and how else [indiscernible] to monetize all the efforts you put into those field [ph] enhancements or is it just, let's just make it better so we keep our renewal rates high?
Andrew C. Florance: No. I mean, I do want to get this 5-year renewal rates back over 99%.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: That's a good goal.
Andrew C. Florance: [indiscernible] Now the -- on our kind of our key growth areas, lenders, banks, institutional investor, owners, we're still single digit penetration, retailers, still single digit penetration. So this is really building a dramatically better product in order to capture more LoopNet upsells, capture more penetration in these new markets, something like multifamily information opens up a whole new segment for us. So prior, again, if you were a major lender, there was a pretty big hole in the CoStar offering that didn't cover apartment buildings. And we've now got that box checked and that opens us up to a lot of new business we couldn't really go for before. The lease analysis tool is something that creates some interesting opportunities down the road. So the more of the user content you can manage and the closer you can get from -- as you can move from being a data source or an information source to actually being a platform that your customers are using to negotiate on, changes the dynamic and also moves you up the line of real-time data. And this gives you a much stronger product, which I think will give us a more valuable product for owners and institutions to use and a whole range of things you could charge for down the future. But right now, we want to get a platform that we could get massive adoption on. So if we can pick up half of the brokers in the industry using our financial modeling tool, it becomes a standard. And then that allows you to move into other areas from a standard bearer position. So it's really a penetration into new markets and setting the platform for new revenue opportunity, like completely new products you'll sell.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then final one for me. As we think about the net new subscription sales number you gave us, that $13.7 million, how do we think about the, I guess, let's call it productivity from that 190 sales people, is that number driven by a small set? Is it the 80-20 rule? Is it more broad based? I guess I'm trying to get at your comfort or confidence around increasing productivity from the sales force based on the numbers you've seen in the past couple of quarters?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, you certainly don't increase productivity when you double your sales force in the short term. So you -- we strongly believe in what we're doing, doubling the sales force like -- it will be negligent not to build a larger sales force to deal with the opportunity we have here. But the process does not increase your productivity. All these new people coming in come in at a much lower productivity level than the established sales people. And as you promote some of your best performers into some management roles or above average performers to the management roles, and as you also move into mentoring roles, your productivity would expect to move sideways for 2 quarters, 3 quarters where you get to your goal of 225. But big picture, as I look at the numbers on individual performance, you still have a remarkably stable production level. We have maybe 5 super performers in the company and then, probably 75% of our sales or 80% of our sales are coming from 50%, 60% of sales force. It's unusual for sales force, it's actually remarkably balanced, with these new sales people dragging the tail down as we would expect and we've seen in the past.
Brian J. Radecki: And so, Brandon, just to add on to that. Yes, I mean, so clearly, productivity per rep is going to be sideways or down, I think, for most of the year, because we're going to be continuing to add people through the end of the year, we will continue to add field sales people next year. But obviously what that does is it gives us the opportunity, obviously, to grow, continue to grow that net new by adding people and then the following year as you move into '15 an '16, then to continue to have more net new, because then your productivity should then be moving up as you stabilize that and move forward. So I think it gives you a 2- or 3-year window what we're doing, sort of at the end of this year and into next year, it drives things for another 2 or 3 years.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: The question I have is regarding these newer solutions, which -- about which you sound really enthusiastic and, obviously, you're putting a lot of marketing weight behind them. You're doing 15% or so organic revenue growth now and continuing to drive really good LoopNet cross-sell success. Presumably, these newer solutions are going to be additive to growth, to the extent you're continuing to talk about 15% or mid-teens. Does that mean that we're nearing maybe a slowdown in the LoopNet cross-sell productivity? Or are you just being conservative? How should we think about the interrelation of those 2 things?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, I would emphatically say that I don't think we're nearing any sort of a slowdown in the LoopNet cross-selling activity. That -- I expect close rates to go up and I expect to be able to keep that going at a stable pace for another 2 years, at least. So it is solid, and we're just now really getting our sales force really to the productivity level to be able to do that sale and delivering the technology tools they need to assist them in it. And we really haven't yet brought the sales force to bear on the full potential of the PL side of LoopNet business, which is the marketing and advertising side of their business. So we're -- I think, we are in the second inning of the whole LoopNet thing, and that might be easily second inning.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. And I will add on to that, I mean, I think that what it's tied to is what we've been talking about. We didn't have a big enough sales force. So now we closed the deal, 1.5 years later, we've done 19,000 demos. So we've gone out once and demoed 19,000 people and we talk about 100,000, 140,000 prospects. We just don't have enough sales people. So I think it's -- everything is sort of tied together. We need to continue to grow the field sales force. It's quite a process to actually take this field sales force and double it because then you have to redistrict everything. And I think we're in the process of doing that. And so I expect that cross-sell to continue for honestly a decade. I mean, think about it, it's been 1.5 years. We've gotten through 19,000 of 140,000 or whatever, 120,000 potential prospects. So I think that goes for a very, very long time.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So I know one of the things that you alluded to, Brian, in your remarks. You've talked about potentially moving away from some legacy LoopNet offerings, perhaps early in '14. I'm just trying to get a sense of cadence, you gave us a little color on this is the investments and what they might mean to EPS mostly in the first quarter. But would expect in early '14 that there might be a slowdown below that mid-teens growth rate as you twilight some of those older products? Is that still something you're thinking about?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. I mean, I think nothing has changed. I've been talking about it for 3 or 4 quarters. So I mean, I think nothing has changed there. But my view is taking that out, I mean, looking at Q2, Q3, Q4, yes, we'll be growing mid-teens sort of year-over-year. And again, factoring in whatever the seasonality numbers are, I mean, you know actually the LoopNet business better than anybody. So like when I talk about Q4, you know basically from Thanksgiving to the end of the year, the LoopNet marketplace is just slow. It has been every year for the past x amount of years. It then comes back stronger in Q1. So I think sort of x some of the things...
Andrew C. Florance: However, we did manage them to their best fourth quarter ever last year.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, Andy is correct. We did. Last year, fourth quarter was unbelievable. So anyways, I think that next year is a great -- I think it's a pivotal year from product development, finishing the back end integration, sales force. But you look at, we're still planning on growing revenue and earnings very, very nicely next year while completing what I think is a lot of significant things, which really set the company up for, like I said, it's not just about 1 year, it's about '14 -- it's about '15, '16, '17 and being able to run in that double-digit mid-teens growth and not just -- I'm not just thinking about 33.6% margin this quarter, I'm not just thinking about the first quarter of 2014. I'm thinking about getting to 40%, I'm thinking about getting to 42%, I'm thinking about getting to 46%. So we're definitely, we're thinking long-term.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. One last one for me. Maybe you can just take a stab at it, Andy. By how much do you think and if you can't put in dollars terms specifically, because I know it's a hard thing to nail down but maybe proportionately, about how much you think some of the newer solutions, lease analytics, multifamily, et cetera, how much do you think those expand your TAM?
Andrew C. Florance: How much do we expand our TAM? It's -- I'm looking at the same market. So I'm looking at, in the last 2 years, we went from 2.6% of the retailers buying our product to 3.6% of the retailers buying our -- and we added hundreds of them. Our owner penetration rate went from 5% to 10% -- 5% to 7%. So I always have believed that you're talking a multibillion dollar opportunity and what these products do is just better position us to get the kind of penetrations, rates we think are possible in these, just really attractive, solid markets like the lender banking, institutional owner, the retailer, even corporate America. So we've achieved 80% penetration rates among the biggest brokerage firms, or the large brokerage firms, or mid-to-large brokerage firms. And we're moving the dials on these other 4 or 5 segment, but we haven't begun to move them like we move the brokerage. And that's what this is really all about. So potentially, you add $100 million plus by moving solidly into the multifamily. And the financial modeling tools is a -- easily $100 million there. But again, the real thing is, we know what this market opportunity looks like. We have very -- we have great growth rates, very low penetration in 4 sectors we think are huge. And it's going to move us down the line faster. And again, address the problem of the 98% renewal rates for customers 5 years or over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Huang from Needham.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: First of all, Brian, you had reiterated kind of your comfort level and confidence in this annualized $500 million target as we exit next year. And I think you threw in there and possibly more, and I can't remember or recall if that was the first time you said it or not. But I was just wondering, as you walk through or think about what are the potential kind of upside drivers to that target, maybe just kind of help me understand where that might be coming from. Is that just better-than-expected sales productivity? Is that better-than-expected kind of uptake of this new product? Maybe just kind of walk me through, what are the upside drivers to that target?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure, yes. I mean, I think it's a lot of things that we've been talking about in the call. Obviously, we're significantly increasing the size of the sales force. So as most people know, I'm fairly conservative in my numbers. I'm a show-me guy. I want to see productivity from some of these first. So I think that there could definitely be upside from the sales force and how we execute on that. Obviously, the better we execute, the higher the revenue, I think, we can be. I also think there can be upside on a lot of these releases that we talked about. And I think there could be upside from -- Andy talked about broker adds. I've said this fairly clearly on prior calls. I'll say it again. I'm not putting very much revenue -- or actually I'm not putting any revenue in my models for broker adds, I'll probably put a little bit but not a lot. And the reality is, until I see the first contract in dollars come in the door, I'm not going to be throwing a bunch of revenue in my model for that. So I think as that rolls out and we start to see some revenue in the first quarter, second, third quarter, that could provide upside as we move along the year, and hopefully we can do better than we thought. The reality is, it still won't be a big number for next year. The but then, it can obviously be much bigger as we see success there in '15, '16 and '17. That, as Andy mentioned, you can get Zillow, Trulia, HomeAway, you got a lot of marketplaces out there that do hundreds of millions of dollars in those areas. And I think over the next 5 years, we can see that. But I'm going to be conservative. I'm not going to start putting -- I've always said this, I'm not going to start putting revenue dollars in guidance for products that haven't released yet. I learned the hard way on that one.
Andrew C. Florance: So I haven't talked to Brian about it, but I believe that his numbers for next year probably include below average production levels for the 225 field sales people. And so the way you get upside is that the field sales people perform at average.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's great. It's great to see kind of the improvement on the conversion rates as the Loop consolidates. I was wondering, as you think about kind of what that upper bound of kind of those close rates and what it could be over time, did you have kind of thoughts around that? And maybe I missed it, but can you give us kind of the number of kind of what that qualified Loop, lead base looks like, as we exited Q3? I think it's 140,000 last quarter.
Andrew C. Florance: Correct. And it's a modeled number. I mean we look at these leads, and we run assumptions against them and say, what do we think the real addressable folks are in that market? So the number is over 100,000. It was 140,000 using the same consistent model we've been using over time. The important takeaway is that despite the fact that we were able to cross sell so many people into CoStar, the size of the pool of prospects grew on us. So we weren't upselling them as fast as we were getting new ones, which is probably a result of the recovery. You get more people reentering commercial real estate, and so we're not able to upsell them. Again, it's part of why we're growing the sales force.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And last question, and I think you kind of touched on this a little bit, but in terms of the mechanics of kind of the Fusion pricing, is it a la carte? So are there some of those things that they could buy just kind of piecemeal or do you have to buy the entire platform? If you're a suite customer, like what's the ARPU gains you get as you move to kind of the broader Fusion platform?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, the Fusion platform suite, historically, we've had an awful lot of customers who were buying just COMPS or just Tenant or just Property or Property Express or even look at LoopNet as a continuum of our product line, so LoopNet Premium Searcher. What Fusion does is it creates more and more reason for these folks to step up to the suite level. And as they do that, you're -- they're coming up 50%, 75% in pricing. So the pricing schedule, obviously, based on number of shops, national, local, is just incredibly -- it's too complex to have a quick answer that's one-size-fits-all answer. But typically, you're going to get a lot more accounts going up 50%, 75% as they go from buying one of our products to buying the suite application. And then the other thing that's occurring here is this release is probably the last release that is a generic one-size-fits-all CoStar Suite. The next release will probably have the system divergent to a one product that's addressed towards brokers and then another product, which looks very similar but has different functionality, that's addressed to lenders and owners. So this is the last generic release or one-size-fits-all release. When that owner institution release comes out, it will probably be at an ARPU of 4x the average of the broker version.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ian Corydon from B. Riley & Co.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: I think you just partially answered my first question, which was do PPR subscribers have access to the new analytics in CoStar? Or are they meant for a different customer? And then when does that owner user interface come out? Is that 2014?
Andrew C. Florance: That will be definitely 2014. And know that someone at -- probably 80% of the people of our customer base subscribes to CoStar already. And I'm going to just guesstimate that the 20% that do not, they're multifamily players. So now, they will be an audience that will probably want to subscribe to CoStar Property. When we launched the owner version of CoStar, we will be bringing the capabilities of the PPR web product and to merge it with the CoStar product, and they'll be a one-stop shop, which we hear from our customers, they'd like to see. They'd like to be able to get the forecasting analytics screen tools in the same environment as they get the micro detailed data and leasing proposals and so and so forth. so we'll be -- the CoStar owner product will not include the advisory services, the access to analysts, the briefings. But it will have the same functionality as the PPR website integrated in the CoStar website.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: Perfect. That makes sense. And that's kind of what I figured. And then am I reading the guidance right that Q1 adjusted EBITDA might be a little below 30%? And then for the rest of the year, you'll be kind of in that 30% to 35% range?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. I mean, I think we're going to be generally in the 30% to 35% range, Q1 sort of including the marketing and all that, it will be around there. Obviously, it depends on where we end up in the fourth quarter. But, yes, it will be close.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik from Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I had a couple of questions on margin. I think, Brian, you mentioned last call, it's a business model, where $0.70, $0.80 of every incremental revenue dollar can fall to the bottom line. I think I had gotten you guys at about a 74% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin for this quarter, year-over-year, I think slightly less than that for the first 3 quarters. But I'm just wondering, is that sort of the range that you expect to stay in, in terms of an incremental adjusted EBITDA margin, that 70% to 80% range that you mentioned?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. I mean if you look at the gross margin, it's at over 71% now and I think it's up 4 points over last year. So, yes, I would continue to expect that you're going to drop $0.70 to $0.80 through that line. I think that will continue to grow, over time, on a long-term model basis. And then, yes, I think that if you look at where we're going, obviously, when you're doing that, we're sort of balancing -- I'd say that this is different than 5 years ago or 10 years ago. We're able to continue to grow and then balance, growing EBITDA earnings. As you've seen all this year, I think we can do that all next year and then I think in the following years, and we can continue to push up the overall EBITDA margins into the 40%, 50% range. I don't think we're limited, I actually don't even think the top end of that range is limited in a longer term model. We've seen for years, some of our larger markets doing 60%, 70%. So right now, I'm sticking to talking about the next 3, 4, 5 years. But I don't think that by any means we're sort of bound by a 40% or even a 50% margin long term.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, got you. And when you mentioned 40% to 50%, that's the -- just to clarify, that's adjusted EBITDA margin that adjusts -- adds back the stock-based compensation expense as well?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, I just wonder -- I know you probably don't want to talk about pricing for particular clients, but I was wondering with the Transwestern deal, how a deal like that impacts the net new sales numbers that you talk about. So if the total value of that client, with all the dozens of contracts that were out there was 100 and the 1 national contract that you signed, the value is 120. What's the impact of that on net new sales, is it 20 or is it 120?
Andrew C. Florance: It's 20. If you're going from 100 to 120?
Steve Weinstein - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Andrew C. Florance: It's 20. We're very net new focused.
Operator: And there are no other questions in the queue.
Andrew C. Florance: Well, thank you everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in about 3 months -- 3.5 months, perhaps more. Well, thank you very much, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CoStar Group Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead.
Richard Simonelli: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to CoStar Group's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. We're glad you joined us today. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I have some really important facts for you to listen to. First, of all, certain portions of the discussion contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in the CoStar Group's July 24, 2013 press release on second quarter results and in our filings with the SEC, including Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012, as well as our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2013, which we filed yesterday. In each case, under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As a reminder, today's conference call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at www.costar.com., and a replay will be available approximately 1 hour after this call concludes and available until August 28, 2013. To listen to the replay, call 1 (800) 475-6701 within the U.S. or Canada and (320) 365-3844 outside the U.S. and Canada. The access code is 297687. And a replay of this call will also be available on our website soon after the call concludes. So I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Florance.
Andrew C. Florance: Thank you, Rich. Welcome and thank you for joining us today. I think we have some very strong news to share with you today. CoStar's 2013 second quarter was our best quarter yet, as we achieved our highest ever net new sales quarter, our best-ever quarterly revenue and EBITDA results. Revenue grew to $109 million for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $23.8 million or 28% year-over-year. Our annualized net new sales bookings in the second quarter climbed to $14.4 million, an increase of 49% over the same period last year. This is our second consecutive quarter of record annualized net new sales. In the second quarter of '13, we added 1,300 new CoStar information subscription customers, which is the highest number of new subscribers we have ever added in a quarter. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have added a total of 4,700 new clients, the most in our history during a 12-month period. In the second quarter of '13, our EBITDA increased 209% year-over-year to $25.3 million, a new high point for CoStar. Our EBITDA margin rose to 23% in the second quarter, up strongly from 10% in the second quarter a year ago. This shows our ability to flow a high percentage of every incremental revenue dollar sold to the bottom line. Some of the primary drivers behind our solid results are: one, continued strong cross-sales for our -- of our CoStar information services to our LoopNet clients; two, strong results from our LoopNet marketplace as we see higher average price points, longer contracts and more firm-level purchases; three, solid performance across all 20 of our product lines; four, cost synergies achieved in the LoopNet acquisition; and finally, continued recovery in the commercial real estate economy. We continue to grow the top line, and we are reinvesting in the business aggressively for future growth, while at the same time expanding our margins. We're hitting on all cylinders and building an even stronger platform for the 7.4 million registered members we've got, and our hundreds of thousands of paying commercial real estate customers. When CoStar acquired LoopNet last year, one of the core rationales for the purchase was the potential to sell CoStar's premier commercial real estate information to LoopNet's large commercial real estate community on the Internet. In the first year post acquisition, we have clearly delivered on that potential for cross-selling between the LoopNet and CoStar communities. Through the second quarter of 2013, the CoStar sales force had achieved $27.3 million of revenue synergies from our acquisition of LoopNet, which is an increase of 48% over the first quarter's cumulative total of $18.4 million. Of the $27.3 million in cross-selling synergies through quarter-end, $18.4 million of the revenue is from selling CoStar information to LoopNet users. This represents an increase of 48% quarter-over-quarter as well. $6 million in revenue synergies is attributed to selling an annual firm contract for LoopNet Premium Lister, where before the client was previously free or a paid individual user on a month-to-month agreement. Generally, the sale of the company that are done at the same time with the sale of CoStar services to the LoopNet firm. Revenue from this type of sale grew 53% quarter-over-quarter. Finally, $2.9 million of the cross-selling revenue was generated selling LoopNet Premium Lister to CoStar clients, which is an increase of 45% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, through June 30, 2013, we had cross-sold our products to 4,800 commercial real estate firms. We have closed approximately 31% of the 15,500 sales cross-selling demos we had arranged. We believe that we can continue to increase the close rate. The number of cross-selling deals we are closing has accelerated to nearly 600 per month. The 4,800 firms we have cross-sold to date represent less than 4% of the active CoStar and LoopNet prospects we believe are out there for cross-selling. I believe that we are nowhere near reaching the cross-sell potential from the merger yet. And at this point, I believe cross-selling revenue could be several hundred million dollars over time. Another significant factor to consider is the size of the LoopNet prospect pool. The LoopNet team has grown the LoopNet membership remarkably in the past 12 months. The number of LoopNet registered members grew by 21%, or nearly 1.3 million over the last 12 months; which is a robust gain of approximately 25,000 new members a week. We now have 7.4 million registered users, and the number of unique monthly visitors to loopnet.com has grown by 36% year-over-year to nearly 5 million. LoopNet's flagship information product is Premium Searcher. In the first quarter of 2012, before it closed the merger, Premium Searcher had annualized revenue of $18.7 million. Not only have we converted nearly that amount of information revenue by selling CoStar to LoopNet members, we also simultaneously grew LoopNet Premium Searcher revenue 27% to $23.8 million annualized. That depth and strength of the market really came as a surprise to me and is great news. The bottom line is, the pool of LoopNet subscribers we have to sell CoStar information services into is growing. Over the past 3 quarters, we have referred to approximately 100,000 prospects at LoopNet that are prime candidates for CoStar information analytics services. Our most recent analysis of LoopNet leads, using the same scoring system as last summer indicates that the lead list has increased substantially over the last year. In fact, the number of individual prospects has grown from 100,000 to 140,000 in the past 12 months. While we are very pleased with the strong success we have had over the past year, we remain focused on accelerating our sales momentum. We are taking steps to further educate our sales force, reallocate sales resources, improve marketing tools and deploy software solutions in an effort to accelerate our cross-selling and traditional selling activity. Extensive market research and experience leads us to believe that the commercial real estate community will pay significantly more for a high quality, more accurate information source. If you have followed the Loop CoStar merger for 2 years, you've heard me talk about the challenges a CoStar salesperson with normal training has in conveying the qualitative differences between 2 enormous databases like CoStar and LoopNet. I have also commented that post-merger, we plan to build software tools to automate those comparisons for our sales people and clients. I believe these tools will help our LoopNet clients more readily assess long-held views on where to find the best information solution. In turn, I believe that this will likely result in an even higher pace of CoStar information and analytics sales to LoopNet members. Our system team is making fantastic progress on these comparison tools that will reside in LoopNet, CoStar Suite, and CoStarGo. I expect they will be deployed on the third quarter of '13. The first comparison tool for the iPad is in beta, and I'm thrilled with what I've seen so far. A CoStar salesperson will be able to use CoStarGo to view any geography and be able to instantly show the prospect the multitude of listings that are only found in CoStar for that area. I believe it will be very compelling to our prospects that hate to think there's even one listing they're not aware of in their market. We plan for the comparison tool we are building into LoopNet to be only visible to the core up-sell targets. The software will help us to identify prospects and compare their results with what they could achieve if they upgrade to our higher-end CoStar information product. My hope is that these tools will help us achieve close rates in the 40% to 50% range. Although we are already achieving our best-ever sales revenue and EBITDA numbers as a result of the LoopNet cross-sell, I believe we can achieve even better results if we accelerate the transformation of our sales force structure to better address the larger opportunity we have. This transformation is underway and in the early stages. Around the time of the close of the acquisition of LoopNet, we had a combined sales force of approximately 325 total salespeople, with 131 in the field. From the outset, we knew we needed more field salespeople. Without a major disruption of the business, in the last 12 months, we increased the size of our field sales team by approximately 37% to 180, all the while achieving our best-ever sales and revenue results. Many of these new salespeople were recruited from our inside sales team and have successfully transitioned to field sales roles. We are expanding our field sales management infrastructure to ensure maximum productivity from our expanding field sales team. You may recall, we have a team of financial services sales specialists that focus on institutional clients and prospects. These sales specialists are generally, dramatically more productive than our average salesperson. We plan to significantly expand this successful, vertically targeted program by initially adding 30-plus field sales positions focused on 3 to 5 non-broker customer verticals. These salespeople would focus on specific prospects and clients, such as owners or lenders, retailers, institutions or appraisers. Now that we have more than a dozen products in 6 major client verticals, it is much more manageable to train and develop a salesperson extensively and properly on how our services add more value to one client vertical, rather than to all of them. We also plan to structure our marketing and product design teams around our 3 to 5 primary client verticals. Our effort to solve -- evolve our sales force may cause some short-term friction, but we believe it will result in even better sales results over the intermediate and long term, and possibly the short term as well. It is our belief that this next stage structure results in greater client satisfaction, higher penetration rates across all our customer verticals, more effective marketing programs and more valuable products. I'll chat a little bit about LoopNet Premium Lister. In the 3 years prior to LoopNet CoStar merger announcement, revenue for LoopNet's core Premium Membership products have fallen approximately 11%. In the 12 months prior to the announcement, it had grown only a paltry 3%. During the 12-month period since the merger closed in the second quarter of '12 until the second quarter of '13, revenue in LoopNet's core business had turned around and grown 21%. So in the past year, LoopNet's new management team has taken their product from little revenue growth to substantial revenue growth, with a 600% increase in revenue growth rate. For LoopNet Premium Lister, LoopNet's flagship marketing product, the turnaround is even more dramatic. In the first quarter of '11, which was the last full quarter before the Loop and CoStar merger was announced, revenue for LoopNet's Premium Lister had fallen 21% over the prior 3 years and had fallen 2% in the 12 months prior to the close of the transaction. In the last 12 months, revenue in LoopNet's core business, Premium Lister, had strongly rebounded and grown to 20%. So LoopNet Premium Lister is 20% year up year-over-year. The turnaround is even more impressive at LoopNet when you consider that, at the same time, we removed 31% of the costs in the LoopNet business. I believe one of the fundamental changes driving success in that business is that the new management team recognizes the massive revenue potential of LoopNet Premium Lister and has given it the priority it deserves. Each month, approximately 5 million unique visitors from all over the country come to loopnet.com and view commercial properties. I believe it's a great service with the ability to help connect the right buyers with the right properties in a way no traditional offline method could ever do. LoopNet makes a huge difference to the owner or broker that gets a deal done through a connection made in LoopNet's massive community of buyers and tenants. We have also made a number of tactical adjustments to how we sell core LoopNet products that are directly contributing to driving our strong results. We increased Premium Membership, average revenue per unit of new sales 57%, from $56.47 in the second quarter of '12, to $88.65 in the second quarter of '13. Overall, Premium Membership ARPU is up 10% year-over-year from $66.04 to $72.90. Prior to the merger, 90%-plus of LoopNet Premium Lister subscriptions were inefficiently sold to the individual on a month-to-month basis via inside sales. The typical commercial real estate property takes more than a year to sell or lease, so a 30-day marketing program did not make a whole lot of sense to us. We have changed that, and the second quarter of '13, 48% of all Premium Memberships sold were on annual basis and 24% were quarterly. At this point, we've now eliminated the monthly option altogether. This means that the average contract term has gone from 1 month prior to the merger to approximately 7 months now, and that the average new LoopNet contract value has moved from $56 at the merger to $620 today. We found that when a broker was subscribed into LoopNet, only 20% of the brokers in that broker shop were subscribed into LoopNet Premium Lister. A major reason is that if a broker was in a 10-person shop, say, the LoopNet sales force was trying to reach each broker, one by one, to sell them each a month-long contract. Theoretically, in a worst case scenario, that could require 120 sales per year at $56. We have now clearly shown that a much more efficient way to sell LoopNet is to reach out to the principal of the firm and sell the firm an annual contract with volume pricing covering 100% of the firm's brokers. This means we only need to make 1 sale, not 120. We believe that these longer-term firm-level contracts will reduce churn. In the past, year, we have reduced cancel rates on LoopNet premium members 10.7%, from 6.1% in the second quarter of '12, to 5.48% in the second quarter of '13. I believe it will go down further. In the 3 years prior to the merger, only a minority of product design and software development resources were allocated towards enhancing my favorite product, LoopNet Premium Lister. We changed that and made it top priority at LoopNet. We are making significant progress on 2 product enhancements to LoopNet's marketplace that we expect will launch this year or, at the latest, early next year. First, we do not currently give brokers the opportunity to market their services to the millions of monthly visitors interested in commercial real estate that come to LoopNet's website. Not only have we received feedback from brokers that they would like to have this opportunity, but in fact, we've received complaints that they cannot get this opportunity. We are designing and building a new product that will enable brokers to market their service to the tenants or buyers looking for properties in areas they specialize in. On the residential companies -- on the residential side big companies like Zillow, Move and Trulia earn tens of millions of dollars annually from similar product offerings for their brokers. Second, brokers and prospective tenants spend a significant amount of time driving from building to building touring available space to see which ones are a good fit for their needs. They need to do this because there's such a wide range in the quality of spaces within buildings. If an owner has a higher-quality space they are marketing, it is in their interest to make sure brokers know it's great space, even if the broker has not had time to drive out and see it. We are going to make this easier for owners to accomplish by offering walk-through video advertising on our website. We are very well positioned to offer this service, as we have infrastructure of a nationwide team of field photographers we've trained to film walk-through videos. We expect to offer LoopNet Premium Listers the opportunity to purchase walk-through videos later this year. Now let's go across the pond to U.K. We launched CoStar Suite and CoStarGo in the U.K. just 6 months ago. We have had a very positive reaction to the products, with strong uptake. And the second quarter sales result was our best ever for the U.K. operation. Since beginning of the year in the U.K., we have sold 200 firm-level subscriptions of CoStar Suite. About 60% of these sales were from new customers and 40% from upgrades to existing customers. A number of owners have subscribed, including one of the largest property companies in the U.K., Grosvener Estates. Another notable new institutional client in the U.K. is Citibank. Prior to the U.K. release of our CoStar services, only about 12% of our U.K. information revenue was from commercial real estate owners and institutions. Since the launch of CoStar Suite and CoStarGo, we're seeing 40% -- not 12% -- 40% of our sales coming from owners and institutions. This is a large customer vertical, so we believe that delivering products that are appealing to them indicates significant upside potential in our U.K. operation. Our profile is definitely growing throughout the United Kingdom, and we're getting positive feedback from users and prospects alike. We conducted a survey of CoStar subscribers and our newsreaders in the U.K., 78% of CoStar Suite subscribers told us that they believe that we have better data than our closest competitor. And it was only a couple percentage points going the other way. So this was dramatic shift from earlier surveys. I believe we are now the clear #1 provider of commercial property information services in the United Kingdom. The survey also provided an indication that there is a large market for us to target. So far, we've upgraded about 5% of our U.K. client base. We believe that we can, over time, up-sell most of the remaining 95% of the clients still on our old FOCUS system and, hence, be confident of significant growth potential over the coming years. Toronto, Canada is just a 90-minute flight from our headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Greater Toronto Area has a population of 6 million people, is the fourth largest city in North America, behind lovely Mexico City, New York and Los Angeles. CoStar markets that are similar in size to Toronto generate $10 million to $25 million and more in revenue annually on very high margin; so these large markets are valuable. The majority of major commercial real estate firms in Toronto are already CoStar clients in the U.S., the U.K. or both. We are unaware of a competitor with CoStar's capabilities in Toronto. We believe this market has significant earnings potential over time, so we've invested several million dollars over the past 18 months building what we believe is the most comprehensive database of commercial real estate information available for that market. Our Toronto research team has built a database with details on 1.3 billion square feet of commercial real estate and 55,000 properties with 200 million square feet of available space. Based on the number of properties in the database today, Toronto, Canada is the seventh largest market of CoStar's North American markets. We expect to launch our service in Toronto before year's end. While it represents a substantial revenue and leverage opportunity in the intermediate term, we do not expect Toronto to generate meaningful revenue in the first year, as none of our major markets have historically done that. It's usually in years 2, 3, 4 that they really start to pick up. Turning to our software development and product enhancement efforts, we've invested approximately $5 million over the past 2 years into the first of a series of significant broad product enhancements for our core CoStar Suite and CoStarGo products. We expect to release the first of these enhancements in the fall, and we believe that they will enable us to increase customer satisfaction and achieve even better sales results. We have built a new query interface for CoStar Suite that builds on the huge success we have with CoStarGo. Our clients have told us they love the visual, intuitive interface that CoStarGo offers, so we've built that into our web environment. We have updated our interface to give our web products greater visual appeal. We have built a very robust lease valuation tool that a broker or owner can use to enter the myriad of parameters of a lease and determine the true time-adjusted cost or value of that lease. We believe that this will empower our brokerage clients to provide more insights to their clients and accelerate the decision-making process without having to spend extensive time and spreadsheets calculating lease values. We also believe that this tool could become the standard lease value calculation tool and thereby become the preferred method of communicating lease proposals between brokers and owners. We have built a new, expanded analytics product that we believe will help us penetrate even deeper into the owner, banking, investor verticals in commercial real estate. We have even built an analytical tool into CoStarGo, which allows a user on a mobile platform to generate dozens of realtime market stats on CoStarGo in the field. We expect to release our full, new, multi-family properties module with this next release of CoStar Suite and CoStarGo. We have invested millions of dollars over the past 2 years building, what we believe, is the most comprehensive database of multi-family properties in existence. Multi-family real estate is one of the largest components in commercial real estate, and is in an area in which we have not historically provided complete service. We are now tracking information on 290,000 apartment communities with 5 or more units, for a total of 16.8 million apartment units. We are capturing information, such as building details and quality, effective rents, concessions, occupancy levels, ownership, property sales, unit sizes and mixes, images and many other details. This data can be queried and analyzed in the product to provide valuable analytic insight and information on market trends. We believe we can sell this new service to an array of banks, investors, brokers and others with multi-family loans and investments. In total, the new search interface, analytics tools, mobile analytics, lease valuation tool and multi-family product are expected to represent one of the biggest product releases we have ever made. We're very excited about it, and we anticipate it will position us for a strong fall sales season. Equally important, we believe that these product enhancements will give us a tailwind in our efforts in United Kingdom and Canada. In addition to our flagship services at CoStar and LoopNet, we have nearly 2 dozen brands and product offerings. We are hearing a clear message from our clients across these products that they are aware we own all these brands, and they prefer to use them as one integrated whole. They see the potential benefit of seamlessly moving data from CoStar to Virtual Premise to LoopNet to Reaction Web to REApplications, on to Resolve or to PPR at COMPASS. Such integration would give them greater insight to the market and streamline their operations. They're not just looking for CoStar data tied into one of these various products, but they want one web site with everything integrated. We see the potential value and we're responding to that demand. We've hired a strong firm named Interbrand to help us in organizing, updating, streamlining and optimizing our various brands. We expect to complete this study by the first quarter of 2014. This work with Interbrand is expected to help us to set priorities and formulate a strategy and timeline for integration of various software platforms in '14 and beyond. Beyond CoStar and LoopNet, a number of our other services are doing quite well: BizBuySell, #1 site in the Internet for buying and selling businesses; Lands of America, #1 for rural land; Land and Farm, REApplications, Virtual Premise and PPR all hit record revenue levels in the second quarter of '13. One of the strongest standouts in this group is Virtual Premise, which turned in 52% revenue growth year-over-year in the second quarter. Virtual Premise is our real estate project and lease management solution for commercial real estate. Virtual Premise signed or upgraded services to major retailers in that period, including: Texas Roadhouse; Robert Half; Kelly Services; Hibbett Sports; Schwab -- Charles Schwab; Polo; Michael Kors; Sony; Abercrombie & Fitch; U.S. Bank; Genuine Auto Parts; Motorola; Goodyear; BBVA; Regions; Bank, State of Georgia; and Talbots, among some others. So congratulations are in order for all of these market vertical teams. Finally, real estate market conditions, briefly. We're seeing a continued broadening of the recovery in the office markets. This recovery is no longer concentrated in tech and energy markets. It's slow but steady commercial real estate recovery, which is a very good operating environment for sustainable growth for CoStar. The strength in office job growth support 25 million square feet of net absorption in the first half of '13, up 5 million square feet, or 23% from last year. Office demand growth is widespread, with over 1 million square feet of net absorption year-to-date in 8 metros: including Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Orange County; San Francisco; and San Jose. So it's a nice, broad, healthy spread. This demand growth, plus a relatively modest 5 million square feet of net completions allowed vacancy rates to fall to 12.1%, which is okay. Improving occupancy is beginning to generate increasing rents, a welcome change for our clients who earn revenue based on commissions from leasing or selling space. Nationally, gross asking rents are up an average of 2% year-over-year. Which is modest, but the highest growth rate since the recession ended. Office sales volumes year-to-date is up 10% versus a year ago, similar to 2005. As investors search for return, the sales volume growth has been concentrated in the secondary markets, such as a Seattle or Denver. Rent and demand growth in the apartment sector continues to be solid, but slowing in many markets. Property sales for the first half of '13 are running 13% above year-ago levels for the same period. The fundamentals, rents and occupancies, are generally increasing, which should support equity values on average. Recently, the potential for increased interest rates did send shock waves through both equity and lending markets. However, we are expecting a relatively slow pace of interest rate increases, so the impact upon real estate is likely to be tempered because other factors, such as improved rents and net operating incomes will likely offset the impact upon the commercial real estate market. So I'm very proud of our results and the progress we have made in the first half of 2013. I'm really excited about the second half of '13 and beyond, as we launch some exciting new technology that I believe will provide significant additional value to our clients and appeal to our prospects. I believe this quarter is clear proof point that we are on our way to reaching our goal of $500 million, or $0.5 billion, annual revenue run rate with 30% to 35% margins when we exit '14. I think Bryan will point out adjusted EBITDA margins, but we'll see where we go there. And we are well on our way to doubling the size of the business over the next 5 years on even higher margin rates. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Brian Radecki. And Brian, I took about 15 minutes of your time, so if you could do it quickly.
Brian J. Radecki: What else is new? Thank you, Andy. I'll try to see if I can make up some time. I'll pick up the pace here. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance in the second quarter of 2013. CoStar's information analytic services continue to show strong growth, and the successful integration of LoopNet continues to be a big contributor to the growth in our revenue and earnings. EBITDA margins continue to expand, driven by accelerating revenue growth. Additionally, as Andy discussed, revenue synergies continue to ramp up and have increased to $27.3 million since the acquisition. Now let's talk some numbers. Starting with CoStar's revenue results for the second quarter of 2013, the company reported $109 million of revenue, an increase of $23.8 million, or 28%, compared to $85.2 million in the second quarter of 2012. Along with strong core information services performance and the continued progress on cross-selling efforts, we saw strong revenue growth from the LoopNet marketplace and the verticals. On the pro forma basis, which takes into account LoopNet's pre-acquisition results, year-over-year revenue growth for the combined company is accelerating compared to pre-acquisition growth rate and continues to move up towards the mid-teens, which we talk about frequently. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $32.6 million for the second quarter of 2013, which is an increase of $12.2 million, or approximately 60%, compared to $20.4 million for the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA includes the impact -- excludes the impact of stock-based compensation and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to approximately 30% in the second quarter of 2013 from 24% in the second quarter of 2012. This is consistent with our stated medium-term goal of achieving the $500 million revenue run rate, and 30% to 35% margins by the end of 2014. Clearly, I'm pretty excited about the fact that we're able to demonstrate that level of margin 6 quarters earlier than expected. While adjusted EBITDA margins may move around a little due to timing of marketing and other investments -- and I'm sure of stuff that Andy hasn't told me about yet -- our second quarter results demonstrate the potential for continued strong earnings and expanding margins. Gross margin of $76.9 million in second quarter of 2013 was up compared to $57.1 million in Q2 of '12. Gross margin percentage was 70.5% in the second quarter of 2013, a 3.6% increase year-over-year, compared to 66.9% in the second quarter of 2012. Earlier this year, I indicated that I expected to see the number eventually climb to 70% mark at some point in the future. Well, let's say the future is now. And again, this demonstrates the strength of the earnings power of our business model as we continue to grow revenue, dropping it to the bottom line at high incremental margins. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2013 was $17.2 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, a 64% increase from the $10.5 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2012. Net income increased to $8.3 million in the second quarter of 2013, compared to a net loss of $6.7 million in the second quarter of 2012, which included costs associated with the LoopNet acquisition. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms, in our press release issued yesterday, which is available on our website, on the Internet at www.costar.com. Cash and investments totaled $211.8 million as of June 30, up $22.7 million from $189.1 million last quarter. Cash flow remains strong and cash and investments are nearly $50 million higher than our short-term and long-term debt of $161.9 million. Clearly, our balance sheet is in great shape, and Charlie sleeps well at night. At this point, I'm going to give some additional color on a few numbers that further highlight our strong performance in the second quarter of 2013. As Andy noted earlier, we achieved a record high $14.4 million in annualized net new sales in the second quarter, based on our ongoing success of driving sales of our information analytics services, LoopNet's Premium Lister product and our cross-sell efforts. I'd like to point out that we believe this is -- that this great sales number actually understates our success. Net new sales of subscription services on annual contracts is even higher at $16.1 million. The higher sales level of annual subscriptions reflects our efforts to replace the short-term LoopNet agreements with higher-value, longer-term and, hopefully, higher renewing contracts. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts is $80 million for the second quarter of 2013, or 73.4% of total revenue. For the trailing 12 months June ended 2013, subscription revenue totaled $296.4 million, up 17% from the 12-month period ended June 30, 2012. At this point, approximately 72% of our revenue is coming from annual subscriptions, while the remaining 27% is primarily made up of the marketing services, including LoopNet's Premium Members on monthly or quarterly agreements, SHOWCASE revenue, as well as revenue from advertising across both platforms. As we continue to progress in up-selling LoopNet subscribers to 1-year contracts, we expect an increasing amount of marketing revenue to be included in our subscription revenue metric. The renewal rate for annual subscription revenue remained very high in the second quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar's subscription-based revenue remained at approximately 94%. Looking forward, as we see more and more annual Loop contracts becoming a part of the subscription base, it is possible to see the 12-month renewal rate edge down slightly, possibly 1% or 2%. We plan to watch this closely and expect to continue to provide clarity on the trends as we move forward. The renewal rate for CoStar subscribers who have been with us for 5 years or longer was consistent with last quarter, and remained at a high 98%. In a previous call, I discussed ongoing patent lawsuits in which LoopNet and CoStar were sued for patent infringement by CIVIX, a firm that owns several patents, but does not have a real business of its own other than to sue technology companies for patent infringement. I guess the legal term for this is very, very technical. Jon Coleman, our GC who is sitting here with us, tells me they call them patent trolls. Sounds scary. CoStar has filed its own lawsuit, seeking a declaratory judgment against CIVIX. These cases, as well as another lawsuits CIVIX filed against LoopNet involving another patent, are now pending. CoStar intends to defend itself vigorously against CIVIX' claims and believes neither the company nor LoopNet has infringed the CIVIX patents, and the patents are invalid. Jon Coleman is shaking his head, yes. Outlook. Now I'll discuss the outlook for the third quarter and full year 2013. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, revenue growth rates, renewal rates, which all may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate or by the overall global economy. Our position on the impact on foreign currency. Exchange fluctuations on our top line results remains consistent. We do not attempt to predict the exchange rate fluctuations and our guidance assumes little or no volatility to the current rate. Actual results may vary from these estimates. Call your doctor if you have a headache. Based on the continued strong sales performance of our core information analytic and marketing services, our sustained high renewal rates and the significant cross-selling results we've achieved to date, we are raising the revenue and earnings guidance. For the full year 2013, we now expect revenue of approximately $134 million to $138 million, which is a $6 million increase to the midpoint compared to prior guidance. We also expect revenue for the third quarter of 2013 in the range of $10 million to $12 million, which factors in the usual slower summer months. Also, due to the cost and revenue synergies materializing from the LoopNet acquisition and our ability to grow revenue at high incremental margins, we expect the full year 2013 non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $2.31 to $2.36, based on 28.1 million shares, an increase of approximately $0.16 at the midpoint compared to prior guidance. For the third quarter of 2013, we expect fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.61 to $0.63 based on 28.2 million shares. Additionally, to restate a key point from our last call, we're taking steps to deemphasize or discontinue certain products and services and expected -- the expected 23 -- 2013 impact is included in our revenue and earnings guidance I just talked about. Currently, we expect to stop offering certain services at the end of this year. Therefore, the first quarter of 2014, our revenue run rate would mechanically go down by $2.5 million to $3 million to account for this. As a result, Q1 2013 revenue would be flattish, or possibly up $1 million or so, compared to the fourth quarter of this year based on current estimates. After the first quarter of 2013, we expect year-over-year growth to continue in the mid-teens range. Essentially, all of this equates to $10 million to $12 million lots of revenue in 2014, all of which we discussed several times on prior calls. This is just something that should be considered by analysts and investors in their forward-looking models. Also in 2014, we expect our weighted average shares to be approximately 28.7 million. In summary, I'm very pleased with the second quarter 2013 results, which provide insight into the outstanding revenue and earnings of the combined businesses, and even higher potential moving forward. Revenue growth is strong, and we expect to continue to see high margins through 2013 and beyond. Based on the revenue and earnings results for the second quarter of 2013, I continue to believe we are well on our way to the goal I first shared with you in early 2012, of $500 million in annual revenue run rate by the end of next year, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the 30% to 35% range. We also remain focused on the longer-term goal of building the business. I shared with you last quarter, in doubling it over the next 5 years and growing our revenues to $800 million of annualized run rate exiting 2017 at even higher margins. We continue to believe the potential revenue opportunity for CoStar is massive. And as with our track record, as it shows, we believe we have the operational depth, cash flow and market position to take advantage of these opportunities. As always, I look forward to sharing our progress with you on these goals in the coming quarters. And let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we go to the line of Will Marks of JMP Securities.
William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: I guess I wanted to ask about the balance sheet. And you talked about your pristine balance sheet, but cash keeps growing. So what do you plan to do with cash besides let it build?
Brian J. Radecki: Excellent question. I just bought a new mattress. [indiscernible] $5,000.
Andrew C. Florance: I'd like to apologize for the fact that Brian is a little punchy on the results. So as you know, it's been building very quickly off the LoopNet acquisitions -- off the LoopNet acquisition. So as always, we are addressing what we believe is a huge market opportunity. And also, as we've mentioned in the past, there are other opportunities for acquisitions over the next year or so, and we're constantly evaluating that. Right this moment, we're focused on achieving the synergy potentials from LoopNet, along with a lot of organic product initiatives. But generally, we would not look at this level of cash as being excessive, and we'll watch that question as we move over the next year or 2 and balance questions like when and how much the debt we should retire.
William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Right. And I know I've heard you on the road talking about some of the smaller U.S. players. Are there any large overseas, Asia, Europe competitors, buying opportunities?
Andrew C. Florance: Obviously, I don't want to -- I have to be careful not to mention anything specifically. There are -- I think, the seas are changing, and there's some pretty interesting things. If you go back 10 years ago -- I believe just roughly, at the back of a napkin -- 10 years ago, there was probably about $500 million of market cap with publicly traded companies providing real estate services on the Internet. And today, your -- before we come out of this year, it will probably be at $22 billion of market cap globally, with some substantive players, be it residential or commercial in China, Australia, France, United Kingdom, the U.S. So I think that over the next 5 to 10 years, I think there's some wildly interesting opportunities. And we're not going to be looking in anything that is small or very small. But we're intrigued by some of the opportunities out there, and we think there is some interesting stuff. It's usually a little bit bigger. But we're -- right now, as you can see from the earnings call and all the things we've talked about, we have some good things going on, and we want to focus on doing that well and not getting ahead of ourselves.
Operator: And next, we go to the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Brian, just could you clarify a little bit? As I go through the 10-Q and look at your MD&A, the discussion of the LoopNet revenue contribution -- which I think you said this quarter was $14.8 million -- if I just back that out from the revenue growth, it implies CoStar organic revenue growth that would have decelerated to just under 11% in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Is there something that I'm missing? Or some mechanical or other adjustment that needs to make -- needs to be made to get to the true underlying organic revenue growth?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean, I think what you look at is prior to the acquisition, both companies are growing at like 10%. Both CoStar and LoopNet, the core information services, are all now moving up and accelerating into the mid-teens. The LoopNet business is growing, obviously, at the -- in the high-teens in 20% in some product areas of LoopNet. Obviously, their businesses, their core services, are growing at 20%. Some of the other ones are growing in the mid-teens. So they're definitely growing a little bit faster than CoStar. But CoStar continues to accelerate. And of course, the majority of the cross-sell is really going to be attributed to sort of selling the information and analytics. So the $27 million, $18-some million of it is really selling CoStar services to the LoopNet client base. So both companies are growing, accelerating into that mid-teens area, which is where I think we'll be for years and years to come.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: But is it accurate though that LoopNet contributed $13.2 million in the second quarter a year ago from 1 month of operations -- sorry, from 2 months -- and that this -- from 1 month, pardon me. And that this quarter, you had it -- no, I was right the first time, 2 months. And this quarter, you had it for 1 month, and it was $14.8 million. I guess there's some crossover in the way that you're reporting the...
Brian J. Radecki: Sure. Yes, I mean what it is, is that there's some deferred revenue adjustments in there. And then it's probably where you're looking at the synergies coming in, and you're attributing it to either CoStar or LoopNet. I mean, overall, we view the business in sort of one -- as one-in-one segment in the commercial real estate, and we really report our stuff geographically, U.S. and U.K. So I guess it just depends on which place you're allocating the sales force. I mean, my view is, we have one sales force. That sales force sells CoStar. It sells LoopNet. So obviously, as long as we continue to produce record sales results, to me, it doesn't really matter which side of the business it comes from. So a lot of it's just allocations.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: So look at the net new as the best indicator?
Brian J. Radecki: 100%. I mean, and I would say that, if you look at that, that's definitely what I'm looking at.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then housekeeping question. Could you give us the number of subscription client sites at the end of the quarter? And also, I may have missed it, the number of premium LoopNet members?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure. Subscription client sites were about 21,770 and Loop Premium Members were about 84,320, both of them up pretty significantly year-over-year.
Andrew C. Florance: Brian, is that number just CoStar property?
Brian J. Radecki: CoStar subscriber sites.
Andrew C. Florance: Right.
Brian J. Radecki: 21,770.
Andrew C. Florance: And one of the challenges there is that 21,000 subscriber sites gets a little less meaningful as you look at -- the number is probably dramatically higher when you look at all the other combinations.
Brian J. Radecki: Correct.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Sure. I understand and appreciate that dynamic. And then Andy, a high-level question. You noted that the CRE market recovery seems to be gaining some momentum. Can you talk about where you think we are in the cycle? And if we see a full-blown recovery, what does that mean for CoStar's sustainable organic revenue growth? Is there still an incremental tailwind to come as the recovery matures and expands?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes. I mean, for sure, you're -- if your dealing with a 12-hour clock with the beginning of the recovery. 6:00 in the -- 6:00 on the clock would be the height of the next -- top of the next cycle. We're probably at quarter after, at best. So we are -- I mean, the industry is looking at it saying, clearly things are improving. So we're in the phase where people are saying, "Okay, now I'm admitting things are clearly improving." But there are so many things that people out there would look at and say, "Ouch, this isn't quite right." So rents are still relatively soft. On an inflation-adjusted basis, rents have not really moved up in quite some time. And you've got this low deliveries, but the demand really hasn't been massive. I mean, I was looking at these good absorption numbers, but they're not massive. And one would expect in a full economic recovery you would get absorption numbers orders of magnitude higher here. And when that happens, with the absolute complete lack of supply, except in multi-family, I would expect you'd get some significant rent growth and some significant NOI growth, which is good news because you're going to have interest rates come up, which is going to leave people that bought buildings for a 4% yield feeling silly. And so it's going to be a balance between those 2. But I would say that there's a lot of room for significant tailwind here. But again, CoStar makes money from different segments of the market when things are going to hell in a handbasket and CoStar makes money from a different segment when things are going well. We definitely prefer when things are going well. That's where we make the most money. But we're definitely in the early, early, early phases. Like most people, I'd say, probably -- sentiment is that probably half the industry would say we're still in the downturn. And they haven't realized that we're coming out of it yet. It's a long answer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Huff from Stephens Incorporated.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: One numbers question, and I think I just missed it: The number of salespeople, and I don't -- and I can't remember if, Andy, you said -- talked about that or Brian you did. Can you guys just run through what you said again? I apologize.
Brian J. Radecki: Sure, yes. I mean, we've got about 180 in the field. We've got about 100 or so inside sales reps. In total, we've got about 335. So that's been pretty consistent the last few quarters. We would expect obviously to continue to work on getting that field number up -- field numbers up pretty significantly year-over-year. But we're going to continue to try to grow that over the next few quarters and really through next year.
Andrew C. Florance: And I just saw 10 in the lobby that just started today.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And so what's the -- so the total -- so just, wait -- run -- so 180 plus 100, and then 335? I don't -- I missed that.
Brian J. Radecki: Well the difference is just in the verticals and advertising reps in the U.K. and a bunch of other ones. But the key numbers, which we talked about is about 180 or so in the field we know, which is up pretty nicely compared to when we closed the deal. And then sort of 335 in total. And again, I think -- we've been talking about this for the past 3 or 4 quarters. I think the total number is, plus or minus, in sort of the range that we'll be in, but it's just more and more, getting more in the field is obviously an important factor.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the cross-sales, obviously you had cumulative cross-sales in an annualized metric, were up 50% again, and they were up about 50% last quarter, too. Tell us about how that continue -- I mean, other than we're all recognizing that it's -- sort of your revenue is sort of a layer cake, in that once you have a certain amount of revenue, it just continues. It doesn't go away, you don't have to resell it. We get that. But tell us about the -- how it's increasing so much so quickly? Just more color on that would be helpful. I think people are trying to figure if we're nearing a peak on Loop sales? Or we still have a lot more to go? Is sustaining this 50% sequential increase the kind of thing that we can continue to see or what's the trend there?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, you have to imagine, I think about this a fair amount. One of the -- one of the challenges is we've got a large sales force just scattered all over the United States. It's one of our greatest strengths, and it also is like a large ship. It turns slowly. And when you have an opportunity like this to cross-sell these 2 massive audiences, and they really are massive, it requires a lot of training. You got to take both of these prospects for your products and get them to change a long -- a decade-long-held belief on which information product is right for them or what marketing solutions are good for them. You also have to simultaneously change the deeply-ingrained, well-practiced behaviors of the sales force. Both these groups have got to change some behaviors and do some learning, and that's take -- I didn't expect that to happen overnight. So what's happening is, the sales managers, the salespeople are getting -- are learning more about how to communicate the differences and benefits of the services, and you're starting to see that take hold, and people are getting better at it. So initially, you might have had 20% close rates and now you're moving up to 37% close rates. And the thing I'm the most excited about is, this whole automation thing. These are massive databases. They're geographically dispersed databases. They're very -- they're not very homogenous. Like you can call a building lots of different things. So it's very difficult for a sales person to walk in and talk to someone who's been using LoopNet for 10 years and say, "Hey, this information system is twice as powerful as the one you've got from LoopNet." Well, the LoopNet person felt LoopNet was great. And they're right, but the other one's even greater. So the automated tools take something that almost nobody can do, and makes it really easy to do. And then right there, boom. You can look at a neighbor and say, "In this neighborhood where you, Mr. Broker, are practicing, here are 20 properties that you would not find in LoopNet because they're only discovered from our field research and our people calling in the research center, and you need to upgrade from our LoopNet information product to our highest end product to take advantage of that." These people cannot stand it if they think they're missing one listing, and these new automated tools will help them get there. I was in England last week, and I was talking to a client in a focus group, and I had forgotten that we had put one of those automated tools in our system, in our retail information solution on the web in the U.K. And the broker was saying, "You know, I feel like I have to buy all these things from you. I was buying your shop properties, like the e-mail distribution, but this little box kept popping up telling me there were more properties in your other higher end system, FOCUS, so I had to go buy that." And it just reminded me that the automated tools work. And my belief is that you will see our sales force get more and more productive over the next 3 or 4 quarters in doing this cross-selling. You've seen that we're only addressing in the LoopNet group, it's only 5% we've gotten to. And so I think we'll see progression here over the next 3 quarters if we do this well, and if we achieve what I think can be achieved. We also -- we're just putting a round of price increases through on LoopNet Premium Searchers who had not had a price increase in like 5 or 6 years and, basically, are paying the same price they were paying like in 1970 or something. And of that group of people who are intense users, long-term customers of LoopNet, we have not demo-ed 80% of them. So 80% of the people I would think were the very best prospects have not yet been met with. So I think we will be able to see continued traction here. And I wish I could train the whole sales force faster and develop better sales tools faster, but it just has taken a year, and it'll take a little bit longer.
Brian J. Radecki: And just to add on to Andy's short remark. And I keep saying this, and I think I'm going to keep beating this drum. This isn't a -- I mean, someone said to me that we had a "blowout" quarter. It clearly was the best financial quarter we've ever had and sales quarter. I mean, obviously, you can't expect that every quarter. Q3 is typically sort of slower in the summer months. But I think year-over-year, I expect progress. I'm not sure I would expect every quarter to have the same quarter-over-quarter results. The other thing though is that, what we've been saying this is a massive opportunity. This isn't something that we're just going to sell into this quarter, next quarter or next year. We're going to be selling into this for the next 5 years, possibly 10 years. I mean, I truly, truly believe that it's hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, and it comes in over time. It just -- you can't get to everybody fast enough. You can't demo everybody fast enough. And obviously, we continue to do all the things. Increasing the size of the field sales force and automated tools, everything else that Andy said. But people should look at this as a long-term thing. They shouldn't be looking at it as a short-term thing. I think year-over-year, we will grow the numbers. Again, I wouldn't expect massive every quarter.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then one last question. Andy, you talked about the leads going from 100,000 to 140,000. I think you also alluded at least maybe in your answer to my question before about your thinking at least maybe they're segregated a little bit more? One is, folks in the Loop segment that might get CoStar stuff, it sounds like maybe you've got another segment now, too. Can you just fill us in on how that number expanded and what segregations do you think about them?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes. I expected -- when we closed the deal, we started actively going after folks who were buying Premium Searcher and trying to upgrade them to CoStar property. I expected Premium Searcher to contract. I really thought as you had 180 sales people, clearly, the Premium Searcher universe trying to pull people out and off to the CoStar end, so you'd see it contract. It grew. And the site traffic grew. And the registered members grew. And the unique monthly visitors grew. So the pool of people engaged in LoopNet is growing much faster than we're pulling people out of it and moving them up in the information, which is fantastic. Again, the 3 segments: the first hardest focus rationale prior to merger was selling information to people who are using LoopNet as an information tool. And that one's the most mature of our sales process. That one's the $18 million. That one's going great. And that's the one that's going to get the most benefit over the next 3 or 4 quarters. We think that will accelerate more. The second group is, as we go out to meet with someone to up-sell them into CoStar info, they still need that separate value proposition of advertising on the Internet, but they usually have just 1 or 2 people in the shop buying these marketing packages. The salesperson, while they're trying to up-sell them into the information sale, says, "Guys, you shouldn't buy a LoopNet for 1 or 2 brokers, for marketing clients for 1 or 2 brokers. You should buy it for the whole firm. You get a much better value." And that's the second component. That's the -- what was it $6.8 million?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes.
Andrew C. Florance: And that one's been growing -- one that grew a little bit faster. That one's growing faster as well because it's easy for the salespeople. It's a no-brainer. And then the one that hasn't even begun to rumble yet, the one that is still in the early, early stages is selling LoopNet advertising into the CoStar group. That one's only -- I forget the number, $2.9 million?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. Only 45%.
Andrew C. Florance: And that one grew 45%. That one -- and that one, we haven't yet begun to really put as much effort into the training on, but I have a lot of confidence in that one. So that one probably is one that will accelerate in '14 or later '14. I don't know if I answered your question, but...
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Yes. And it just sounds like that the answer, from going from 100,000 to 140,000 is that the contraction in the Searcher didn't happen. That, that's growing. Is it also because you're data mining more? I mean, you now know what kind of leads make sense or what prospects you're converting to leads? I mean, is that also a part of it?
Andrew C. Florance: I -- yours truly can spend 10 minutes in the spreadsheet and fire out more leads than these people can get to in the next 3 years in under 10 minutes. So it's not the data mining. It's the fact that with recovering commercial real estate, with better SEO on the LoopNet side, with better customer experience in the LoopNet side, just more people are gravitating to LoopNet. The LoopNet brand is really strong. It's the preferred. It is the place to go for tenants and buyers, and there's millions of them. And it's just growing. So you got 2 different worlds. LoopNet is all about the tenants and the small investors, and CoStar is about the hard core commercial real estate professionals. And as the pro-sumer base at LoopNet grows, that just gives us more people to upgrade to the hard core professional system.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Huang from Needham & Company.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of questions for you guys. So first of all, not sure if I missed this -- I mean, you had talked a little about kind of the field sales and how that's ramping. But did you throw out a number for what you would expect growth to be in that group by end of next year? What's your assumption so far given the massive kind of -- and perhaps even better-than-expected lead base that you could sell into?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, remember, we're shifting our resource allocation from inside to field. But I would like to see us come out of this year at 225 salespeople. And I would like us to, at a minimum, to be at 250 in '14. Now remember, we're also going to move to more customer vertical selling orientations. So what you would see is, where right now you might have 8 salespeople in Washington D.C., next year you might have 12 sales people in Washington D.C. but 2 focusing on owners, 1 focusing on lenders, and 1 focusing on retailers, and the rest, general. So we're going to -- we're generally looking for 250-some middle of next year, end of next year. 225 this year, which is very aggressive.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, 225 is aggressive. I think our original goal is to get up to 200. So if we can get above that, that would be great. And obviously, there'd be a lot of new people and a lot of training. So I mean, I think the productivity of them, you will start to see it as you move into next year. I think that will help continue to grow. And as Andy said, we start to look at the different client verticals. And it's not just with the sales force. It's with the product releases that Andy talked about. This is where -- you look at all these verticals where we're less than 10% penetrated, which we've got great clients and great prospects. This is where, over again, not -- this isn't just about 1 quarter. This isn't just about next quarter. It's not just about next year. It's where, over the next 5 to 10 years, I think we can continue to penetrate and go from single-digit to double-digit penetration levels because now we're focused with the sales force, now we're focused with the marketing plans, now we're focused with the services and the software that meets the needs of those various client verticals we've been talking about. So I think these are things that we're doing are not short-term. They're for long-term. And I think everybody sees the potential that we have.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Got you. And so the vertical orientation of the sales force, I mean, is that beginning now or does that begin at the beginning of 2014?
Andrew C. Florance: That probably begins fourth quarter.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Got it.
Andrew C. Florance: I mean, we had a little bit of that now, we have probably -- we have a little bit of that going on right now. But it will be -- it will pick up in the fourth quarter, first, second, third quarter.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, got you. And I guess, when you -- obviously, you've seen some pretty strong kind of bookings performances over the past several quarters here. As you release kind of the next version of CoStar, what does that do to bookings growth rates? I mean, is it possible that we could see even further acceleration than kind of what we're seeing right now, which is pretty impressive?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, the -- I mean, absolutely. So one of the things we're trying to do with these enhancements, we've got some great customers, we've got great market position, and we want to give our clients the products they deserve and make sure that we're doing what we can do and increase customer satisfaction. So I'm looking forward to, hopefully, in the third or fourth quarter, having our customers feeling really good about CoStar and LoopNet. And -- but I think, inevitably, it will make it easier, again, to up-sell people in the information side. I think it will help the multi-family. It will help us reach people that prior wouldn't have had a value for our systems. It really didn't cover their segment of real estate. And then also the LoopNet -- the new LoopNet product opportunities, I think, are huge. Like I have said before, and it may happen or it may not happen, but I think the broker advertisements in LoopNet could one day be bigger than the property advertisements in LoopNet. So I think that -- so the answer is yes. The stuff could absolutely -- and they could be any one of the 3 or 4 things we're doing. But we're also -- we've got a full pipeline. So we've got additional stuff we're trying to do in '14 and '15 as well. And I was really quite pleased with Virtual Premise. And as we integrate that, and I think that will be very attractive to the retail community.
Brian J. Radecki: And hopefully, people got the thread which we've had in the last few calls. And Andy talked about it now is that, we're operating and hitting on all cylinders, while we're still investing in the business, while we're able to grow the margins. And this is a long-term business model. This is where you drop in $0.70, $0.80 from the top line to the bottom line, where we can still invest in multi-family retail, software development and all the different areas that Andy talked about. We still invest in Toronto. So I think we're able to, as a larger company than we were a few years ago or 5 years, 10 years ago, we were able to balance investments and still growing both top and bottom line. And we're laying out a lot of investments that, I think, over 2014, 2015, will continue to allow us to grow in the mid-teens for 5, 10-plus years.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Got you. And last question for you. Can you talk a little bit about the improving sales productivity and kind of the impact that has on conversion rates of the Loop base? Brian, so when you're thinking about 2014, and kind of what you've laid out for exiting 2014, what kind of assumptions have you made around conversion rates of kind of the Loop leads that you're going after? Is there an assumption that we're going to see an aggressive improvement there? Or have you held it pretty constant with kind of what you're seeing now?
Brian J. Radecki: What I usually do when I look in through my crystal ball is, I don't project blowout quarters, and I don't take all the most aggressive assumptions. I mean, I think people have been watching us for years. But I do challenge the assumptions. So I mean, I think that I look at where we are at today with those conversion numbers and where we are with the sales force, and I try to come up with sort of realistic goals to get to. And then, as always, we like to do better than that. I don't think it's a secret that Andy and I are both pretty aggressive guys. We like to do better than what we put out there. But we do put out some pretty aggressive goals. When I put out the $500 million run rate over 1.5 years ago -- which is still 1.5 years away, so it was sort of a 3-year goal -- I had a lot of people telling me, "No way." And now, I have people telling me like, "Okay, that's done." Which is not done. We still got another 1.5 years ago. What's the next thing? So I think that We try to put out reasonable goals. And Andy and I always strive to do better than them.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik from Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Just a question. I think last quarter you mentioned that March was a particularly strong month for the annualized net new sales. I was wondering if there were any differences across the months of this quarter?
Andrew C. Florance: Which was our best month?
Brian J. Radecki: April.
Andrew C. Florance: I think April was our best month ever. So I guess stronger in April. And I'm not sure about June.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, those have been pretty much all very strong.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, they're pretty much -- I mean they're -- what I would I say, Todd, is that March was our best month ever, followed by April as our best month ever. But it's not...
Brian J. Radecki: April was stupid.
Andrew C. Florance: But it's not -- but they're not significant enough through the quarters. I mean, I think that it sort of averages out through the quarter. So it's not like we're getting 80% of our sales in 1 month and it drops off the next month. It's pretty consistent from quarter-to-quarter. But obviously, we've had some really, really good record months. We are coming in the summertime, which is typically slower. And we have a lot of stuff happening in the fall as far as product releases and ramp-up of the sales force. But we're pretty excited about where we are and where we're going.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And just a point of clarification, the annualized net new sales, $14.4 million, and I think you mentioned, Brian, the net new sales under annualized contracts was -- I think it was $16.1 million, if I heard you correctly?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. So that difference -- I mean, do we expect those numbers to converge at some point over time? And I'm wondering if that point in time would be sort of second quarter of 2014 after you've gone through this process of deemphasizing or discontinuing the products in the first quarter of next year?
Brian J. Radecki: I think there will be a difference for quite some time and, probably, forever. I do think they may get closer. And the reason why is because, essentially, what this is, is -- one of the big differences is you're converting out the LoopNet client base. I don't actually expect that the LoopNet client base will ever get to the CoStar 90-plus percent on annual contracts. I mean, I think there's always going to be a bigger piece of their client base that stays on something less. And that's the big difference in the 2 numbers. So I don't think they'll ever become exactly the same. There'll be a difference. And I do think it will continue to close, but then I think it will stay like that. I think the subscription one is obviously what the majority of the business is driven on. So what that sort of shows is that you're driving the business sort of -- at sort of higher rates. I think that implies a positive momentum moving forward, is the way I'd describe it.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then last question for me. I think you talked about 5% of the U.K. having switched to the -- I guess, the new technology where they can get CoStarGo. I know you guys released CoStarGo a while ago in the U.S. and that requires the subscription to the full suite of products. Do you have a similar percentage for the U.S., in terms of what percentage of your subscribers get all 3 and have access to CoStarGo versus ones that just get kind of one-off products?
Andrew C. Florance: We do not off the top of our heads, my -- I'm going to give you a broad range guesstimate. I would say 50%, 60% have access to Suite.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And is that still -- are you guys still seeing an upgrade opportunity there? Or has the focus really moved to the cross-sales and things like that?
Andrew C. Florance: We are definitely seeing up-sell opportunity there and I hate to -- I mean, to get specific, one of our very best customers over 2 decades, approaching 3 decades, would be Jones Lang LaSalle. We're close partners and work very closely together. There are a number of Jones Lang LaSalle's in the United States does not have our Suite product. So like there's still a lot of revenue upside potential there.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions.
Andrew C. Florance: Great. Well, thank you all very much for joining us for the second quarter '12 -- '13 earnings call. And we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CoStar Group First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead.
Richard Simonelli: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to CoStar Group's First Quarter of 2013 Conference Call. We're delighted you joined us today. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I have some really important facts for you. Certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group's April 24, 2013, press release on the first quarter results and in CoStar's filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012, under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color over the Internet on www.costar.com. A replay will be available approximately 1 hour after the call concludes and will be available until May 28, 2013. To listen to the replay, call (800) 475-6701 within the U.S. or Canada; or (320) 365-3844 outside the United States and Canada. The access code is 287842, and a replay will also be available on our website soon after the call concludes. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Florance.
Andrew C. Florance: The day after tomorrow is the second anniversary of our announcement that CoStar had entered into an agreement to acquire LoopNet. In that announcement, we stated that we expected to achieve annual cost synergies of approximately $20 million over the first 24 months following the close of the transaction, and we also stated that we saw the potential for significant revenue synergies through the cross-selling of each company's complementary services to the other's client bases. As you know, it took 1 year before we received permission from the Federal Trade Commission to close the acquisition. Tuesday of just next week is the first anniversary of our closing on the CoStar LoopNet merger, and I'm very pleased to report that I believe the actual results of the merger have clearly met and exceeded those initial expectations. We have achieved our goal of $20 million in cost synergies from the acquisition in half the time we expected. We have eliminated redundant or unnecessary expenses, and I am confident the result is a more efficient and better-managed company that is extremely well positioned for sustainable and profitable growth. I believe the excellent results that the new LoopNet management team continues to deliver prove that point. A skeptic might worry that these significant cost savings might hurt LoopNet's ability to perform. In the first quarter 2013, we achieved the highest quarterly revenue ever from LoopNet's Premium Membership. Since the merger, we have refocused LoopNet to its core strength of marketing commercial properties on the Internet. We have refocused on annual rather than monthly contracts. We have improved the pricing of LoopNet's products relative to their value, and we have refocused on firm-wide contracts rather than contracts with individuals. The result is a 219% increase in the organic growth rate of LoopNet's Premium Membership revenue from 5.2% in the quarter before the acquisition to 16.6% in the first quarter of 2013. The fact is that LoopNet's operation is enjoying $20 million in cost synergies while turning in dramatically better results. On the anniversary of the closing, I believe you'll agree with me, the potential for significant revenue synergies through cross-selling of each company's complementary services has become a reality. Through March 31, we closed 3,067 cross-selling deals between each other's client bases. These 3,067 deals cover over 7,000 users. These deals total $18.4 million in revenue synergies, which is a 26% increase from the $14.6 million I reported on our last investor call just 6 weeks ago. I reported a lot in that earnings call. An hour-and -- 90-minute call. Now here is how the $18.4 million in revenue synergies breaks down. The pure cross-selling of our 2 customer bases totaled $14.4 million, which is approximately $12.4 million in CoStar information services to LoopNet members and approximately $2 million LoopNet marketing services to CoStar customers. During these sales calls, we were also able to move LoopNet customers from monthly to annual contracts for LoopNet marketing, and in many cases, we added additional users at those sites. This resulted in an additional $3.9 million in new sales associated with cross-selling. The LoopNet customers previously only had a combined monthly commitment of $329,000 with LoopNet, so the conversion to 18.4 million in annual subscriptions in little more than 7 months of cross-selling is quite impressive, and I think you'll agree with that. This cross-selling activity has reinvigorated LoopNet Premium Lister revenue growth. After Premium Lister experienced a sharp 21% decline from its high in the third quarter of 2008 and flat revenue performance in the 2 years prior to the acquisition, post-acquisition, it achieved a solid 15% increase from the first quarter 2012 to the first quarter 2013. We believe we are just beginning to realize the potential cross-selling opportunity, with just over 3,000 deals closed off the initial lead list in excess of 100,000 LoopNet and CoStar users we consider to be best prospects. Additionally, the lead list continues to grow as we grow the number of CoStar subscribers, increase traffic to loopnet.com and grow the number of LoopNet members. In March of this year, we added a record number of new registrations to LoopNet and now have over 7 million registered users. In a year in which we have upsold more than 4,000 LoopNet users to CoStar for information to still grow the net new number of LoopNet Premium Members by 8,000 year-over-year -- so we're actually adding LoopNet Premium Members faster than we're converting them to CoStar, which bodes well for future growth. We raised prices on new sales of Premium Lister and Premium Searcher to better reflect the value these customers are getting for marketing and searching properties. We raised the new average sales price on Premium Searcher 57% from $47 per month in August of 2012 to $74 in March of 2013. So we just switched the digits there, I guess. We raised the average Premium Lister price from $75 per month in August 2012 to $96 in March 2013. We have created, and have been successfully selling, Premium Lister with an optional added feature known as National Distribution, which offers additional visibility for our clients' listings on SHOWCASE.COM and on over 200 newspaper websites across the United States. In March of 2013, nearly 4 out of 10 new subscribers to Premium Lister opted for this Premium Lister with National Distribution. The average new sales price in March 2013 for the National Distribution package was $116 per month, which is 54% more than the $75 per month we averaged on Premium Lister sales in August of 2012. At the same time we are increasing prices, we are focused on driving down LoopNet's historically high cancellation rates. LoopNet has historically had cancellation rates well over 500% higher than CoStar's. I have heard from hundreds of LoopNet users who clearly value the leads LoopNet generates and have an ongoing need for the service, so that convinces me that the high cancellation rates are about sales strategy errors, not about any weakness in the service. We believe that LoopNet has fantastic products, but that its historic reliance on selling to individuals on month-to-month contracts has led to these high cancellation rates. Reducing LoopNet's cancellation rate was, is and will be a high priority for management post-merger. To reduce the rate, we are focusing on selling our core rather than our weaker products; on annual contracts rather than monthly; and to firms rather than individuals. When we closed the acquisition last year, the overwhelming majority, or about 95% of LoopNet's contracts, were month-to-month. By March 2013, only 25% of LoopNet's new contracts being sold were month-to-month. 75% of the new subscribers for Premium Membership were signing up for longer-term contracts, with 51% signing annual contracts and 24% signing quarterly contracts. These customers are typically marketing listings for year-in, year-out, so we found very little resistance to going to these longer-term contracts. As of March 2013, quarterly and annual contracts represented 26% of all Premium Lister subscriptions and 23% of Premium Searcher subscriptions. We believe our effort is already working. Cancellation rates on Premium Membership have declined 11.5% from 6.1% in March 2012 to 5.4% in March of 2013. If everything else were to hold constant, I expect LoopNet's cancellation rates to decline materially over the next 12 months. I believe that the most significant competitor to LoopNet's paid Premium Lister product is free LoopNet Basic Lister. Last year, 69% of the listings receiving a marketing benefit on LoopNet were free listings, and only 31% were paid. Through a concentrated effort in marketing, sales, product development and more effective pricing plans, we have dramatically improved that ratio within the first year. By March of this year, we had increased the percentage of paid listings 23% year-over-year from 31% paid to 38% paid. We expect to continue to make good progress in this area. After a strong first year of combined CoStar and LoopNet, we're pleased to report our overall revenue for the first quarter 2013 was $104 million compared to $69 million in the first quarter 2012, which represents an increase of 52% year-over-year in our revenues. In the first quarter of 2013, we booked $13.8 million in annualized net new revenue, which is the most in our history and an impressive 27% quarter-over-quarter increase from the $10.8 million booked in the fourth quarter 2012. That $13.8 million first quarter booking is a dramatic 64% year-over-year increase over the first quarter of 2012 booking of $8.4 million. March was our highest overall sales month of all time. We added 1,126 new CoStar information subscribers in the first quarter of 2013. This is the second-highest number of new subscribers we have ever added and continues the positive trend of 3 consecutive quarters of adding record numbers of new customers. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2013 was $25.7 million, which is an increase of $10.4 million or 68% year-over-year. Through the rest of 2013 and throughout 2014, I expect these margins to steadily improve and for us to reach our goal of 30% to 35% margins as we exit 2014. We are now 3 months into the launch of CoStar Suite and CoStarGo in the U.K. We already have 500 paying customers of CoStar Suite in the U.K. We've also had very good adoption and usage among the initial customers of CoStar Suite in the U.K. The average FOCUS user is paying 35% more to upgrade to CoStar Suite and Go. We're advancing upgrade discussions with a number of our largest prospects in the U.K., and based upon our early positive results, we expect to continue to report good growth in CoStar U.K. sales. Turning to the commercial real estate economy, the demand for commercial space increased in the first quarter of 2013 from 1 year ago for all property sectors. Demand growth for the industrial sector was exceptionally strong, and net absorption in the first quarter was more than double the year-ago levels. Property sales volumes in the first quarter were also up for all sectors, except for retail, which was down 17% from a year earlier and still suffering from a weak and uneven recovery in the growth of online shopping. Perhaps this sector will benefit from proposed Internet taxes. The office sector continued its long, albeit slow, march to recovery in the first quarter, with vacancy rates declining at 0.1% in the quarter and 0.5% over the past year to end at 12.2%. Over the past year, demand was solid at 58 million square feet and increased by 11 million square feet from the previous 12 months. That's real, positive momentum for the office sector. This recovery is broadly based with nearly every major market, except for Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, recording positive net absorption in the first quarter. Office rents rose by 1.2% year-over-year, mostly in the metros with high job growth rates and fairly low vacancies. Office sales volumes are up 19% over 1 year ago, and the pace of sales is similar to 2005 and generally indicates a healthy market. A slow but steady commercial real estate recovery is exactly what I had hoped for, as it creates a sustainable growth environment for CoStar. This summer, we expect to release 5 significant product enhancements to CoStar's suite of services. In order to preserve our competitive advantage, I will not go into detail on these enhancements, but I can say that I believe that these are some of the most substantive product upgrades we have made in my tenure at CoStar, and they will further enhance our ability to drive LoopNet cross sales, U.K. sales and accelerate organic U.S. CoStar sales growth. I expect these product releases will launch a new dimension for CoStar by providing advanced software tools that connect our user community more effectively and make our information more valuable. It's been a truly transformative first year working with the team at LoopNet, and it was made possible by the hard work of our over 2,000 employees, especially the great team leading and driving fantastic results at LoopNet. We have built and continue to expand the largest platform of information, analytics and marketing services in commercial real estate, servicing a huge client base with nearly 200,000 paying subscribers and approximately $10 million unique monthly visitors coming to our websites in aggregate. I continue to believe we're on our way to reaching our goal of $500 million annual revenue run rate with 30% to 35% margins when we exit 2014. The word for the day is going to be "brevity" for me, and with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer.
Brian J. Radecki: After we got charged extra from NASDAQ last time for going long, I guess maybe I'll see if I can get a credit for that. Thanks, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2013. CoStar's information analytics services continued to show strong growth, and the successful integration of LoopNet is obviously a huge contributor to the growth in our revenue and earnings. We've achieved over $20 million in annualized cost synergies 1 year earlier than the 24 months we discussed at the time we announced the acquisition. But of course, more importantly, as Andy discussed, revenue synergies continue to ramp up and have increased to $18.4 million at the end of the first quarter. So let's talk some numbers. Starting with CoStar's results in the first quarter, the company reported $104 million of revenue, an increase of $35.4 million or 52% compared to $68.6 million in the first quarter of 2012. As most of you are aware, prior to the acquisition, LoopNet and CoStar was growing at approximately 10% to 11%, respectively, year-over-year. The pro forma organic revenue growth for the combined company continued to accelerate in 2012 for a total of 12% year-over-year and now is over 13% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2013. As I've said many times, we believe we can maintain strong, double-digit organic revenue growth rates in this range or possibly higher, and of course, over a much larger and growing subscription base for many, many years to come, for the next 3 to 5 years. Due to the massive cross-sell opportunity, we would expect it will be a sustained and consistent pattern of double-digit organic revenue growth versus a short-term pop in the growth rate for a few quarters. Moving to EBITDA, it was $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $11.9 million in the first quarter of last year. This was impacted by a $15.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense for the first quarter -- over the first quarter of 2012, mainly relatedly to performance-based stock awards. In February 2012, the compensation committee for CoStar's Board of Directors approved grants of performance-based restricted stock that would vest upon achievement of $90 million of cumulative EBITDA over 4 consecutive quarters. Sustained earnings growth, folks. These awards support the committee's goals of aligning management's incentives with increasing shareholder value by growing the company's earnings and are consistent with the 2014 exit goals we have been sharing with investors for quite some time. Based on the continued strong performance, the accelerated pace and success of the LoopNet integration and management's increased confidence that it is probable the earnings goals will be achieved in 2014, the company recorded a cumulative catch-up of stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $25.7 million for the first quarter of 2013, which is an increase of $10.4 million or approximately 68% compared to $15.3 million for the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 24.7 in the first quarter from 22.3 in the first quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2013 was $13 million or $0.47 per diluted share, which is an increase of 59% from the $8.2 million or 32% per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. We're very pleased with the strong earnings we achieved in the first quarter. I should note that this is the first time since, I think, 2008 that non-GAAP net income per share increased from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, because Q1 usually has seasonally higher expenses to start the year. Obviously, the significant revenue growth helped us this year. As a result of the cumulative catch-up of stock-based compensation expense, net income for the first quarter of 2013 was negative $2.4 million. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all our non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions of those terms, in our press release issued yesterday, and are available on our website at www.costar.com. Or if you have any questions, you can just e-mail jcoleman@costar.com. That is J. Coleman, our general counsel, at costar.com. Cash and investments totaled $189.1 million as of March 31, which is $22.8 million higher than the total short- and long-term debt of the company, which is $166.3 million. So clearly, our balance sheet is in great shape. At this point, I'm going to give some operating metrics that highlight our strong performance in the first quarter of 2013. As Andy spoke earlier, we achieved a record high $13.8 million in annualized net new sales in the first quarter based on our ongoing success of driving sales of LoopNet Premium Lister products and the cross-selling of CoStar information services to LoopNet customers. I'd like to point out that we believe that this is -- these are great sales numbers, but actually understates the success. Net new sales of subscription services on annual contracts was even higher at $14.8 million. The higher sales of annual subscriptions reflect our efforts to replace the monthly short-term LoopNet agreements with higher-value, longer-term quarterly or annual agreements. In March, for example, approximately 51% of our premium member sales were annual, up from essentially 0 from last year. Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts was $76.1 million for the first quarter of 2013 or 73% of total revenue, up from 72% and 71% in the fourth and third quarters. So obviously, a nice trend there we'd like to continue to see. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, subscription revenues totaled $283 million, up 16% from $243.9 million for the 12 months ended March 31, 2012. Renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained high during the quarter of 2013. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar's subscription-based revenue was approximately 94%, which is consistent with the all-time high reported for the previous 2 quarters. Looking forward, as we see more annual LoopNet contracts becoming a larger part of our subscription base, it is possible, and I would probably expect to see that 12-month trailing renewal rate edge down slightly over time. We'll be watching that closely, and we'll continue to give you guys clarity on the trends as we move forward. The renewal rate for CoStar's subscribers who have been with us for over 5 years or longer was 98%, which was essentially flat with the first quarter of last year and down slightly from last quarter, but still pretty remarkable number. At the end of the first quarter 2013, the existing CoStar business had 100,864 subscribers, up 5,908 from 94,956 in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 3,671 subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2012. The total number of subscriber sites for the existing CoStar business increased to 20,868 in the first quarter of 2013, up from 18,507 in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 657 sites over the fourth quarter of 2012. The LoopNet Marketplace continues to be the premier website for marketing commercial real estate. The number of LoopNet Premium Members in the first quarter increased to 83,943, up 8,114 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The average revenue per paying subscriber, or ARPU, for Premium Members was $69.08 for the first quarter of 2013, up 5% from the first quarter of 2012. By comparison, the average selling price for new premium customers in the first quarter of 2013 was approximately $75, up from $57 in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting the higher-value site-level agreements we're doing and the price increases we've implemented in the quarter. As Andy said, LoopNet registered members, including basic and premium, totaled 7.1 million as of March 31, up 22% from the first quarter of 2012. And field and HQ AEs increased from 174 in Q4 to 179 in Q1 of 2013. Total reps, though, were down 17 from last quarter and totaled 338 at the end of the quarter, mainly due to some -- less inside sales. Now I'm going to discuss our outlook for the second quarter and full year of 2013. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, revenue growth rates, renewal rates, which all may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate or the overall economy. Our position on the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations on top line remains consistent. We do not attempt to predict the foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our guidance assumes little or no volatility to the current rate. Actual rates may vary from these estimates. Call your doctor if your head is feeling lightheaded or dizzy. Oh, sorry, that was something else. Based on the continued strong sales performance of our core information, analytic and marketing services, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance. We expect revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $105 million to $107 million. And for the full year, we now expect $428 million to $432 million, which is an increase of $4 million from our prior guidance. As I stated on our last earnings call, we are taking steps to deemphasize or continue certain products and services, and the expected impact on this year is included in our revenue and earnings guidance. In terms of earnings, we expect second quarter fully diluted non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.50 to $0.53 on 27.9 million shares. For the full year, we expect $2.12 to $2.22, an increase of $0.04 compared with our prior guidance. Rich is cheering me on as I'm taking a little coffee break, because he's going for the record. He's got the stopwatch on. As discussed earlier, we recorded additional stock compensation expense in the first quarter, mainly due to the performance-based stock awards. Moving forward, we expect to recognize approximately $7.5 million to $8.5 million per quarter in total stock comp expense, which includes the additional expense associated with the performance-based awards. If the performance criteria for those awards is met, the actual number of performance shares issued will depend on a couple of factors based on share price, vesting date, taxes, et cetera, et cetera. We currently estimate the outstanding share count will increase by about 250,000 shares to 300,000 shares upon achievement of the performance goal and the vesting of the shares, which, again, we currently expect to happen in 2014. I'd like to speak in a little bit more detail about our forward-looking revenue estimates. As we discussed on the past few calls, we have been deemphasizing certain products, and we do plan to stop selling others at the end of the year. Currently, those offerings that would stop at the end of the year would impact Q1 of 2014 revenue, taking that sort of run rate down $2.5 million to $3 million, or that equates to $10 million to $12 million of annual revenue in 2014, which we discussed on the last call. So that's for the analysts. You need to take a look at sort of your models in the first quarter 2012 revenue. Recently, I've been getting some more questions about sort of my longer-term view on the business. It's funny, I was waking up in the middle of the night, thinking about this the other night. And as I look back on our growth rate, both organically and through some of the strategic acquisitions we've done, we've essentially doubled the size of our business over the past 5 years. Fourth quarter of 2007, we were at about $50 million, and the fourth quarter of last year, which we just closed out, we were at about a $100 million run rate in revenue. Although our revenue base is much larger than it was 5 years ago, I think it's reasonable to believe that we can accomplish the same thing over the next 5 years as far as revenue growth rate goes. This would put us at about a $200 million quarter by the fourth quarter of 2017, or an annualized run rate of about $800 million, or $700 million annualized run rate in 2016. And again, I think we can do this at fairly high margins. While this seems like an aggressive goal, I think it's achievable given the strong organic revenue growth we are seeing and any potential strategic accretive acquisitions that may be funded through our stable cash flow. However, as always, actual results can vary. If your head feels dizzy, call your doctor. We continue to believe that the potential revenue opportunity for CoStar is massive and that our track record shows we have the operational depth, cash flow and market position to take advantage of these opportunities. In summary, I'm very pleased, as you can tell, with the first quarter 2013 results, which provide some insight into the revenue and earnings potential of the combined business moving forward. Revenue growth is strong, and we expect to see margin expansion through the remainder of 2013 and into 2014. And based on the revenue and earnings results for the first quarter, I believe we're well on our way to the medium-term goal we've shared with you on the previous call of a $500 million annual run rate, that's $125 million Q4 2014 revenue quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the 30% to 35%. As always, I look forward to sharing that progress with you in the coming quarters. And now, as you think I'm going to open up for questions, Andy just signaled to me that he wants me to turn the call back over to him for a few more pieces of commentary. Andy?
Andrew C. Florance: We'll turn the call over to questions.
Brian J. Radecki: Oh, okay. Questions. We're going to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will begin with the line of Michael Huang.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of questions for you guys. So first of all, so I think you had mentioned that March was your best month ever. Was that -- so drill into that a little bit. Is that due to the ramp in sales productivity, or is there something else that's driving that? And how is April now trending versus March? I mean, are we going to see another record month on top of March?
Andrew C. Florance: It's probably a little early to talk about April, but for March, I think what happened was the cross-selling is doing well. CoStar Property sales generally are doing well. And then across the broad array of subs we have, everyone was performing reasonably well. So it's basically the consistency of the production across Resolve, our applications, Virtual Premise, Lands of America, LoopNet, CoStar, the U.K. Everyone was performing well, and that basically took us up to a fantastic number.
Michael Huang - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. And can you guys run through the sales headcount numbers again? I was slow in writing that down. And then maybe with respect to that, what kind of assumptions are you making kind of around sales productivity, a ramp given the significant add that you're making around the field sales? And what does that imply to annualized bookings growth rate through the year?
Brian J. Radecki: I'll start and give you the numbers again, and I'll let Andy give a little commentary on that. So from Q4 to Q1, we moved from 174 subscription field and HQ reps to 179. So up 5 in the quarter. And obviously, our goal is to continue to ramp that and ramp down the inside sales. So inside sales is down about 17. So total for the quarter, we were at about 338 total sales reps. So the key numbers, we obviously want to continue to increase our field and HQ reps, and sort of that transition for less inside sales and more in the field.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, so we'll take it to about 215 in the field by the end of the year. And we have a lot of good-quality sales reps on the inside and we'll continue to take advantage of that. And we also expect some improvement in productivity per rep as the year goes on because basically, they're getting the hang of the LoopNet cross-sell, the PL sell, and we're continuing to give them training and support there and trying to get those close ratios up. So it's pretty solid right now. We're also trying to look at some key markets where we may not have had a field sales presence in the past, and our analysis shows that we think it would be pretty productive to do that. So areas like, just randomly, like Tampa, Orlando, had a lot of potential, and I want to try and capture that.
Brian J. Radecki: And Mike, I think as you increase the field number, I think we're seeing increased productivity from our current base. But of course, your layering in some newbies, so that -- they're, of course, not producing as high. So I think for this year, I think we could see some increased productivity, but again, it might be -- that could be offset by some of the newbies. I think this will help us as we continue to move along and into '14, then, obviously. As that headcount goes up and those people start ramping up, continue to accelerate growth rates the way we've seen the last couple of years. Prior to the acquisition last year and even this year, we continue to see acceleration.
Operator: And next, we will go to the line of Brett Huff.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Can I dig in a little bit to the cross-sale numbers? In the past, you've given some helpful data on how many people you've contacted or reached out to, however, of the 100,000. How many people have -- the number of contracts or users gone from -- buying CoStar from Loop prospects and then vice versa? Can you run through those as -- in sort of tandem? I know you've already given us the revenue numbers.
Brian J. Radecki: The -- as we go, the numbers on unique demos is getting a little more challenging as you demo different people in the same shop, but it's basically 8,000 to 11,000, probably in that range right there. So a firm number would be 8,000, but I think there's probably some contact occurring that we're not catching that moves a little bit above the 8,000, as high as 10,000 on up. So, and the second part of your question was -- I wasn't quite sure.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: How many people have you -- how many actual contracts have you sold CoStar -- selling CoStar stuff to the Loop prospects? And then same number for Loop to CoStar, to get the total of 3,000-and-some-odd that you...
Andrew C. Florance: So the total count.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Andrew C. Florance: I don't have that right here. Do you have that?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, Brett, we have to follow up with you on that. I mean, I don't have the breakout of the 2, but as you said, you've got the total numbers on those. And I think what you're going to see on the cross-sell is that we're going to continue to give those numbers. But again, as you move forward, it gets harder and harder because is a demo, was it originally a LoopNet, is it a CoStar prospect? Did you do 1 or 2 different people in the shop? So I think we're going to continue to give as much clarity on that. Clearly, the 18.4 is a great number, and we have a lot of clarity on that. But again, as you move forward, next year, the following year, the following year, it gets harder and harder to break out and label it from one to the other.
Andrew C. Florance: I've got that number. So the site -- the sites with a CoStar sale but not purchasing a PL was 1,683. CoStar sale and purchasing PL, these are LoopNet conversions, info sales to LoopNet customers, was 584. So that's the 1,683 plus the 584. CoStar buying a PL site, 51, and a PL site alone is 749. So -- and I'm not sure that clears it up a little bit, but it's mostly CoStar info sales in the 2,200 range.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: That's the 1,683 plus 584?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And then the Loop to CoStar is 51 plus 749?
Andrew C. Florance: Basically, yes.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And does that 749 include the upsell, meaning not selling Loop to CoStar but just increasing the price or extending the contract on Loop? Or do you have that number as well, or is that included in those?
Andrew C. Florance: I am not certain. We'll have to follow up with you on that.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, all right. On quarter-to-date cross sales, I don't think you talked about that. So you told us mid-Feb, you've now told us to the end of 2Q. Did you -- in your commentary, I didn't think I heard how's things looking in the past 2 months since the quarter closed.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, I think the 18.4 is obviously, since February, it's the end of the quarter. I think we kept giving numbers as of the date, so we were trying to cut them off as the quarter closes. So you went from the 14 to the 18 in a, what is it, 6-, 7-week span. So I think the pace is continuing to do well and accelerate. And then we're just going to give quarter-end numbers now so that we're not giving you guys numbers as of February 20 and April 20.
Brian J. Radecki: There's nothing unusual about the pace from that number to now.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. In terms of U.K., it sounds like things are going well there. And Andy, the number you gave us of 500, just explain what that is again?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. That's basically -- remember, we went out there and we see the market giving, I think, roughly 10% of our customer base access to CoStar Suite who were at the higher end of our fee structure. So the people paying a reasonably fair price for FOCUS, we gave them CoStar Suite and CoStarGo. We got a tremendous uptick on that -- or adoption of that service. And I don't have the exact number here, but to give you an idea of roughly what it looks like, I was checking it, and of about 1,000-some people given access to CoStar Suite, they were running around 700 active 2 months after they'd received it, which means -- that's just phenomenal. I mean, that's better than the adoption I think we've ever seen here in the United States. So the salespeople were not allowed to start selling the new product until January, February, and -- because we wanted them to focus on that adoption. They began doing that. And they've sold 500 units of the CoStar Suite user licenses, individual seats. And that would be a combination of people who are using FOCUS, paying on average 35% more to get CoStar software interface, the Analytics, the mobile platform, and brand-new customers who had not prior been our customers signing up there. So we're getting a good -- we're getting a good takeup over there, and we've got some new leadership over there, which is -- and that leadership, I think, is doing quite well. But the real story will work itself out over midyear. Third quarter, fourth quarter, that's when we should see results.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: And that -- are we still thinking breakeven sort of midyear '14? I think that's what we had talked about.
Andrew C. Florance: Sure.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay. And this is the last question. Thinking a little bit further down the road, you guys have started talking about Fusion a little bit. And I think the strategy is to kind of layer in modules or layer in functionality over time. Are some of the 5 that you talked about but didn't want to give us too much detail on this summer, Fusion modules? Or how do we think about -- I guess the question is how do we get comfort that Fusion can be an additional revenue growth driver beyond Loop? And how soon will we get modules in the field and get data back from you that those are -- that the uptake is sort of good enough to keep driving revenue up?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, we're -- so first of all, I want to tell my competitors, get your pens out, start writing. So the -- we're talking -- I mean, they're related to Fusion and they're some of the things -- things we've talked about, but they were talking mid-summer. And you would see -- you expect to see some impact on our sales bookings numbers in the later part of the third quarter and fourth quarter. And I would expect they would have an overall impact on where we're going there. But we're going to keep it kind of vague just to make sure that we keep the initiative on what we're doing.
Operator: Next, we will go to the line of Will Marks.
William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: First one to ask, because -- I don't think you mentioned mix of business in terms of brokers and other banks, whoever. Can you just give us an update? Has that changed much since this LoopNet integration and the additional selling to LoopNet customers?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. I don't have specific numbers right here on that. What I will say is that we have put a lot of effort on these LoopNet conversions, we've made that a priority, and those are going to be disproportionately brokerage. And I have noticed that the initial phases of the cross-selling, we swung to an all-time high-end new customer pickup as opposed to that normal ratio of 50% upsell, 50% new customer pickup. So we're moving in that towards a lot of pickup of new brokerage firms, which I'm very excited about that, that sort of strategic customers who helps solidify your information base. I know that we're still getting good traction in the banks, but just when you look at the -- these big increases in the booking numbers, those are going to be disproportionately brokerage that shifts the ratio. So I think banks are still moving at the same level as they've been moving in the past. Now this, too, will change, and I would expect that in '14, you'd probably be shifting to -- back towards an even blend of banks and brokers as we bring more product to market that would appeal to folks doing financial analysis.
William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. One other question on the guidance. You guys have consistently been raising guidance over the last year or so, yet that goal of end of '14 hasn't changed. So I guess I'm just wondering, is there -- I hate to keep asking for more, but is there upside to that? Probably not on the margin side, but maybe on the revenue side?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I'll take that question. So we put that goal out there, and I just talked about maybe some new goals of doubling the company again over the next 5 years. They are aggressive goals, and we put them out there 2 or 3 years ahead of time. So we set aggressive goals so that we can reach to get there. Again, if you look at sort of our trajectory and pace of where we are, again, when I forecast ahead, whether it's 1 year or 2 years or 5 years, obviously, I don't forecast ahead with record sales numbers every single month like we had in March. And it's funny, I was sitting around with our Senior VP of Sales, John Stanfill, last night, talking about this. We project, obviously, good, achievable growth, which I think is in a similar range to that we're at. So I think if you sit there and you forecast ahead the quarters, we are deemphasizing some products this year. There's a couple of products we plan on canceling at the end of the year, which will have a $2 million or $3 million sort of step-down in revenue in the first quarter next year, and then you go back to sort of normalized growth rates. You're still going to get to something in that range. So we're obviously running the business for the long term, and so I don't -- I'm not going to expect to move that number. It's still a goal. I mean, I haven't given 2 years of guidance to people. I've given 1 year of guidance, which is 2013, and I think a goal to get to the end of next year, which I still believe is -- like we actually have to perform. If I talk to John Stanfill and tell him that he's got to do 300 to 400 net news for the next 8 quarters, that's not chump change. Like that is actual, real work. And to move your sales force from 170 to 215 in the field and increase your managers and everything else we have to do in that time period is real work. So I think it's still an aggressive goal...
Andrew C. Florance: Pay them for real work.
Brian J. Radecki: But, yes, that's what Andy said. I won't say what Andy said if you didn't hear him, but I think it's still an aggressive goal that -- I'm not going to come off of it, because if you actually look at it, there's still a lot of work to get there. But clearly, with what we're doing in the cross-sells, the numbers that we currently are doing, we're comfortable with that. Realistically, I will come out with that number's going to stay the same until I come out with my guidance for '14, which is, "Guidance is guidance, goals are goals."
Operator: Next, we will go to the line of Todd Lukasik.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Just a quick one, Brian. I think in your commentary -- well, in the press release, I guess, you guys have $13.8 million in annualized net new sales. I think you also mentioned $14.8 million in your commentary. I was just wondering what the difference was between those numbers?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure, yes. That was a -- I told my VP of Finance that, that would be a question. So the $13.8 million is sort of all-in net new bookings for everything. So that would include like monthly services, things we're canceling and stuff like. So there's -- the $14.8 million is just annual contract bookings. So it doesn't include monthlies, it doesn't include quarterlies, it doesn't include the stuff we're deemphasizing and stuff like that. So there's a drag and a difference on that. Obviously, once we get through the deemphasizing of some of these things and we move to more and more subscription-based, those 2 numbers will get closer as we go into '14 and into '15. But that's why there's a difference there now. I think the main point for putting that out there is to highlight the fact that we're moving more people. This is one of the main goals we talked about prior to the acquisition, was that CoStar was, at that point, 93%, 94% subscription-based services, and LoopNet was 0 or close to 0. So this is just highlighting sort of that -- how we're moving towards that goal, which will help improve their renewal rates. Again, it could tick our renewal rates down a little bit, but overall, I still expect 90-plus percent in strong renewal rates. But I think this is just highlighting that we're moving towards that goal, which should be a very positive thing for both revenue and earnings moving forward. Obviously, the more you have subscription-based business, the better your model is.
Andrew C. Florance: And lower volatility in the business.
Brian J. Radecki: Correct.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Right. Okay. And then just a question about deemphasizing the products, discontinuing some products and services beginning early next year, $2 million to $3 million in quarterly revenue you talked about. What's the margin associated with those products? Or should we be thinking about cost savings when that revenue comes out of the business?
Brian J. Radecki: Sure, yes. I talked about in the last call. I think the numbers haven't changed for this year, it's like $5 million to $7 million with associated EPS impact on that. I didn't really give guidance for next year, except I'm trying to make sure that people know -- I said again last quarter, $10 million to $12 million, which is $2.5 million to $3.5 million in the quarter sort of step-down because we plan on turning some things off at the end of the year that we've already started to deemphasize. So again, that will have sort of those impacts. Again, long term, we actually think that we can then come back over the next few years and sell services to those people on subscription and annual contracts, which are much higher-renewing and more profitable and they're on -- and they'll be on the right service. So again, I mean, as I look out into -- as those things stop in '14, and especially as we get out into '15 and '16, as you look to my longer-term guidance I just talked about of doubling the company, I think that comes with, of course, much higher margins. So that's sort of the goal there, is...
Andrew C. Florance: And if you look at the specific products we're talking about, they are not profitable today. And if they are profitable, they're only marginally profitable. And if you were to forecast them out over 10 years, they would require massive amounts of effort in order to get to de minimis profitability. So when we shut them down, we will not take team x and eliminate them and see an immediate cost savings. What's happening is that people that had been putting their efforts into those products have been re-tasked and are selling things like Premium Lister, which is a very profitable business, instead of focusing on selling something that's less profitable like Property Facts or Property Comps. And the software development teams and the product managers that have been supporting those less profitable products are working on very important products like -- well, very important products that we're going to -- enhancements to the core system that I think will be dramatically more profitable and are very high margin. So it's a realignment of who's working on what, and it's an avoidance of additional costs.
Brian J. Radecki: And one more thing to note. I mean, in simple terms, from the sales side, if you're paying a salesperson to do a sale every month versus to having them sell something on an annual subscription basis, you're paying them 12x a year versus once a year. Then, of course, that gets into a 90-plus percent subscription thing. So when these things happen, I think the longer-term profitability impacts are really where you see them over, let's say, a 5-year period. Obviously, what initially happens, you pull $2.5 million to $3 million out of your quarterly revenue and you don't necessarily see a ton of costs coming off. So -- but again, in the longer term, I mean, we've modeled this out. I mean, it's not even close. It's not even a close decision. It's a very easy decision, actually.
Andrew C. Florance: A caveman could make the decision.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just last one for me. Can you just give us an update on Toronto? Is that a market that's still being researched and the database being constructed, or is that a market you guys are actively selling in now? And are there any plans for other markets in Canada?
Andrew C. Florance: You must have a camera in my office, because I have a post-it note on my computer that says Toronto. The -- I've been watching the data. Obviously, it's a major North American market. It's no mean feat to get a high-quality database for that market. And I believe we're now approaching that point where we have the database that would be commercially successful up there. So we are going to -- the timing's not precise, but sometime over the next 3 to 6 months, we'll begin rolling out the product in Toronto, and we would expect to see some revenue in 2013 from that. But again, it won't -- as you -- if you've been around for a while, you know that when you open a new market, it doesn't move the dial for 1 year, 2 years. We're investing in that and some other initiatives, which will eventually yield a result.
Brian J. Radecki: There's no plans right now for additional markets. Again, I think we have a very, very specific operational plan this year and financial plan this year and next year, getting to these goals and targets that we've laid out for people. So I think we're very focused on that. And obviously, in the longer-term 5-year time period, there probably would be more of it. But right now, we're focused.
Andrew C. Florance: And realistically, as you may know, I'm not very good at boondoggle. I've been working at getting better at that, and what I'm going to probably to do is launch Toronto in January just to make sure that it's a miserable experience.

Andrew C. Florance: Thank you, Richard. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. U.K. folks, thank you for joining us this afternoon, for the year-end 2012 and our fourth quarter earnings call. I'm very happy to report that in the fourth quarter, and for the first time in CoStar's history, we crossed the $100 million mark in quarterly revenue. This was a 51% increase year-over-year. We also achieved our highest quarter ever of EBITDA with $20.5 million in the fourth quarter, which is an increase of 86% year-over-year. And with that, I'll turn the conference call over for questions, dial -- No, no, we've got a couple more pages. Our successful acquisition of LoopNet and the realization of the strong cross-selling opportunity between CoStar and LoopNet has been a key driver of these strong results. Our core CoStar Group information business is showing real strength. During the fourth quarter 2012, we booked $8.5 million in annualized net new subscription revenue and added 1,292 new CoStar subscriber customers. For the second consecutive quarter, that is a record number of new subscribers. 3 of our top 5 customers, CB Richard Ellis, Newmark Grubb Knight Frank and Cushman & Wakefield, renewed or entered into new multiyear contracts with us. In 2012, our fastest growing markets based upon total revenue were Los Angeles, with $1.9 million in net new revenue; followed by Dallas, with $1.5 million; Chicago's $1.5 million; Northern New Jersey was $1.3 million; Orange County, $1.2 million; and Charlotte, with $1.1 million. Our fastest growing markets by year-over-year percentage growth were El Paso at 297%; Charlotte again at 99%; Louisville at 61%; Columbia, South Carolina, at 53%; Omaha at 53%; Memphis at 52%; and good old Milwaukee at 51%. Our subscription renewal rates remain at all time highs on the CoStar side. Our 12-month trailing renewal rate for annual subscription-based services moved higher again to 94.1%. And our renewal rate for the more than 5,000 customer firms that have been CoStar subscribers over 5 years was once again 99%. In the 10 months since we closed the acquisition of LoopNet, we have achieved $18 million of the $20 million in cost synergies we have targeted over originally a 24-month target period. So we're very close to achieving all those synergies. So focusing on LoopNet. And as we've previously stated, the cross-selling opportunity resulting from the LoopNet acquisition is substantial. There are 100,000 LoopNet members that we feel are prime targets for CoStar information products. And the vast majority of almost 100,000 individual clients at CoStar are not currently paying to advertise listings on LoopNet. While the additional annual revenue potential is very large, we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity at this early point. Through mid-February, we have closed 2,521 cross-selling deals, where we've either sold CoStar information products to LoopNet users or have sold LoopNet marketing services to CoStar clients. Since we began cross-selling, we have sold approximately $10 million in annual contract value of CoStar services to LoopNet members and approximately $1.7 million of LoopNet services to CoStar customers. We began selling the LoopNet services to CoStar customers later in the process, so that number we would expect to be a little bit lower. Overall, the total amount of revenue synergies is $14.6 million in annualized contract value, which that number also includes bundling LoopNet customers that went from monthly to annual contracts for LoopNet marketing. Before these cross-selling efforts, those LoopNet members, all those LoopNet members, only had a contract commitment of $273,000 with LoopNet. So from $273,000 to $14.6 million. The 2,335 contracts closed since the merger represent less than 2% of the total prospect pool we have to work with. I believe it is quite clear at this point that cross-selling is working and has a lot of potential. Now we're very focused on doing it more effectively. One challenge we face is the sheer size of the LoopNet membership base we need to meet with in order to upsell. Given the size of our field sales force at the time of the acquisition, at a rate of several meetings a week, it would take years to meet with all these LoopNet prospects. At the same time, our account executives are meeting with existing and other prospects. They've got a lot of demands on their time. To address this problem, we selected and transferred approximately 40 inside sales people, predominantly from LoopNet, to our CoStar field sales force. All of these former inside sales people are paired with more experienced sales reps, and each team works together in a specific sales territory across the country. These new field sales reps typically spend 2 days a week each in either of our Washington or San Francisco regional offices. And they spend their time arranging meetings, attending training classes or preparing contracts. They then travel to their respective markets with the goal of having 4 face-to-face meetings a day for several days each week. The program is working very well. These teams are outsigning the majority of our single-person teams and are converting a lot of business. We have taken a large number of quality sales people with high potential who are selling low ROI products and have moved them into much higher potential field product roles -- or field production rules. Our objective is to generate the highest close rate from the meetings we have with LoopNet members. Obviously, the higher close rates we drive, the higher sales numbers we'll get. But the reality is we get a very wide range of conversion rates between our various sales people. In order to improve our sales teams' conversion rates, we've conducted extensive surveys and focus groups with LoopNet members that we are meeting with in the field. So we're basically looking at those who both bought and those who didn't buy and asking them what drove their decision-making process. And I think we've gained an awful lot of valuable information and we'll be able to use it to produce even better cross-selling results going forward. Past surveys have clearly indicated that prospects will pay more to upgrade to higher-quality data with better analytics. Of the people who we recently upgraded to CoStar from LoopNet, 71% of those surveys said they did so to get better data. 71% of those surveyed said they did so to get better data. The second most frequently stated reason for upgrading given by 13% of LoopNet members surveyed was that CoStar helped them compete better in their markets, which could be closely correlated to the first reason given. Clearly, successful cross-selling is all about communicating the absolute fact that our CoStar service has dramatically higher data quality than our LoopNet service does. LoopNet is a much more effective way than CoStar to market a commercial listing to a broad audience, but CoStar has much higher quality data and analytics. Before the merger, surveys showed that only 9% of LoopNet information users thought that the LoopNet information presented significantly less listings than CoStar did. That means that 91% thought they were getting adequate data from LoopNet and had little motivation to pay more to switch to CoStar. After we conducted the initial thousands of demos, we resurveyed and found that only 13%, after all that, thought that LoopNet had significantly less data. Essentially, we only moved the perception needle 4 percentage points after demoing about 6% of the prospect list, yet that small movement generated approximately $10 million in high-margin sales. CoStar's data superiority is a fact. But if a broker has been using another source every day for 12 years, that broker's perceptions are not changed overnight. I'm very confident we can move the perceptions much farther and get higher sales growth. We now know that the first cross-selling demos we did post-merger covered too many points, including a lot of reinforcement of LoopNet's core value proposition of having a huge audience. This served to confuse many of those initial prospects. Now our demos focus directly on one core point, namely CoStar's data superiority. We have also added live, side-by-side comparison demos. We believe this will lead to higher close rates. I want to be very clear, I am extraordinarily pleased with our $10 million of cross-selling to date, but I really do believe we can do even better in 2013 and beyond. As we look closely at the members of loopnet.com, the vast majority of people coming to LoopNet are tenants or small investors with a once-a-decade need for information. These are not good prospects to buy CoStar information services. But we do believe that about 100,000 of LoopNet's repeat longer-term searcher members are great prospects for a cross-sell, upsell to CoStar. These repeat clients, and only these repeat clients who have intensive information needs, we're going to put an automated tool in front of them so that whenever they search LoopNet, they're going to get a live comparison of how many listings would meet that criteria in CoStar and how many would meet that criteria in LoopNet. That will let them see firsthand and in a relevant-to-them way, every single time they search, that CoStar has higher-quality data and will allow them to serve their customers better. We think that will help change perceptions nearly overnight. We tested a somewhat similar strategy a number of years ago in Orange County, California, and it really worked. The bottom line is we are very excited and optimistic about our future cross-sell and upsell potential as a result of the merger. We are every bit excited about the potential revenue growth we see in all of our marketplaces, including LoopNet, BizBuySell, Lands of America, SHOWCASE, Cityfeet, Land and Farm and BizQuest. These marketplaces are all about audience size and quality, and we achieved a tremendously important milestone in January 2013. According to our Google Analytics monitoring software, we hosted 10.2 million unique visitors in aggregate across all of our websites in the month of January. So that's a pretty big milestone for us. More than 1 million of these unique visitors were on mobile platforms. loopnet.com turned in a stunning draw performance with a surge to 5.2 million unique visitors in the month of January. Our businesses-for-sale websites in aggregate had more than 1 million unique visitors in January, as did our land-for-sale websites and our SHOWCASE websites. We believe that our BizBuySell website is a #1 website for businesses for sale and that Lands of America is the #1 website for rural lands and farms for sale. If any of you haven't seen our Lands of America website, it's a great place to look at all kinds of ways you could waste money on expensive second homes. I believe that the achievement of 10 million unique visitors in January is even more meaningful when you consider that these visitors are often coming to these websites looking to purchase assets valued in the millions of dollars. In aggregate, the offerings on these websites exceed $1 trillion in value. In order to give you a better picture of this or help you visualize the sort of traffic we're enjoying, I have set up a temporary website that will give you a good idea of the sort of intense activity our commercial real estate websites see. If you go to views.costar.com, you can see a map that shows all the properties anyone on LoopNet, CoStar or SHOWCASE is currently looking at. Blue pins are buildings CoStar users are looking at right now. Red pins are buildings LoopNet users are looking at. And green pins are properties SHOWCASE users are looking at. You will need Microsoft Silverlight installed in order to use this site. You can zoom in and out using the plus and minus keys and you can pan around the country to see our search activity in your city. So that website is views.costar.com. I feel that LoopNet's core strength and highest potentials in the advertising revenue-generating marketplace has been overlooked in the past, and that the website has much more potential than has been realized. LoopNet has 12 product lines and much of senior management's focus over the last number of years has been diverted away from the LoopNet Premium Lister product, which I believe has the highest revenue and earnings potential. Premium Lister has more than twice the revenue of Premium Searcher and has more revenue than the other remaining 10 products combined. We know that Premium Lister is approximately 10% penetrated in the listings market, and there are many opportunities to build additional site advertising opportunities, so I believe it is by no measure saturated and has very significant growth potential ahead of it. Premium Lister enjoys a significant competitive advantage over any of its direct competitors. In fact, according to compete.com, in January, LoopNet had 87,000% more unique visitors than Rofo and 682,000% more unique visitors than 42Floors or 42nd Floors or however that's said. In fact, I believe that LoopNet's biggest competitor is actually LoopNet's free basic membership marketing. Furthermore, I believe that the business model for some of LoopNet's products compete directly against one another on the same site. And that often, the customer experience choices emphasize products with lower revenue and margin potential over LoopNet's flagship product Premium Lister. LoopNet's sales channels were optimized more like business-to-consumer experiences rather than more like to B2B experiences, which might have been better and more optimal. I say this with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight. And I have nothing but the highest level of respect for the previous management team, who operated the company under a different set of conditions. But the fact is that I think that Premium Lister is the real diamond here in this company, and that's what we're focusing on. Because the Premium Lister, I think, received short shift, the net result was that Premium Lister revenue fell 21% from $51.2 million in 2008 to $40.4 million in 2011, the year before our merger. At the same time, other peer companies with similar real estate related advertising business models that focused their energies really 100% on their advertising marketplaces, like HomeAway, Trilla and Zillow, they all saw strong growth. So while Premium Lister fell 21% in that time period, HomeAway grew 179% from $82 million in 2008 to $230 million in 2011. Trilla grew 380% from $8 million in 2008 to $38.5 million in 2011. And Zillow grew 523% from $10.5 million in '08 to $66 million in '11. After we completed the merger, we reorganized LoopNet's business focus around Premium Lister in an effort to realize the much higher growth rates we believe are possible there. Already, we have increased the organic revenue growth rate of LoopNet Premium membership sales 140%, taking it from 5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to 12% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Premium Lister, which fell from 2008 into the quarter we announced the merger, has begun growing again, and that growth is accelerating. Premium Lister's revenue run rate has grown 17% since its 2011 bottom. As many of you know, LoopNet's revenue growth rates have historically been very cyclical, typically with the strongest revenue growth in the first quarter of each year and each successive quarter weakening until the fourth quarter, which has the weakest growth. Most often, LoopNet's fourth quarter revenue growth is weaker than the third quarter. In 2012 though, fourth quarter LoopNet revenue growth was stronger than third quarter growth. In the fourth quarter 2011, Premium Lister's monthly revenue run rate contracted by $81,000, so same quarter last year, down $81,000. This is in sharp contrast to what we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 where that monthly revenue rate grew by $150,000. The fourth quarter 2012 growth of $150,000 increased 167% over the fourth -- third quarter of 2012 monthly revenue run rate growth of $56,000. So we're basically doing really quite well there with Premium Lister. On average, in December months of '08, '09, '10, '11, LoopNet Premium Lister's monthly revenue run rate has contracted or shrunk $76,000. But in December of 2012, it grew $43,000. On average, the fourth quarters of '08, '09, '10 and '11, Premium Lister monthly revenue run rate has contracted or gone down $150,000, but in the fourth quarter of 2012, it grew by $150,000. Sales for the month of January alone from Premium Lister were better than any other quarter at LoopNet prior to the acquisition. We've made a number of changes to get these better results. Some are very straightforward, like communicating to the LoopNet team that we think this is where we need to put our focus. Some are basic, like using the wealth of good contact information we have in CoStar to target Premium Lister prospects with a number of really good direct mail campaigns. And we've significant increased the level of marketing investment to support Premium Lister sales over what has been historically a very slim LoopNet marketing spend on it. We also changed the commission plans of our sales force so we now pay higher commission rates on the products that have higher average sales prices and higher renewal rates. That means that the sales force now earns higher commissions for selling higher priced, higher renewal rate products like Premium Lister than they do for selling a low average sales price and lower renewal rate LoopNet information product. Just after the merger in July of '12, 87% of LoopNet monthly net new sales came from LoopNet information products and only 13% came from Premium Lister. By January of this year, only 46% of LoopNet's net new sales were coming from the LoopNet information products and 54% was coming from Premium Lister. So it's been a big shift. The LoopNet information products have a monthly cancellation rate more than twice the monthly cancellation rates of Premium Lister. As we make this dramatic shift towards selling Premium Lister, we expect a trend toward lower overall cancellation rates from LoopNet. Another thing we're doing is shifting away from selling monthly contracts for LoopNet services to sign quarterly or annual agreements. Selling quarterly and annual agreements should result in lower cancellation rates. The typical commercial real estate lease listing is on the market for 400 days, so I'm not sure I understand why in the past, we focused on selling 30-day marketing plans for 400-day problems. Now we are paying our sales people much higher commission rates for annual deals than we are for quarterly deals and we pay no commissions on monthly sales. People can still buy it on our website but we don't pay commissions on it. In addition, we're giving discounts of up to 39% off the per-month price if customers commit to an annual contract rather than a month-to-month contract. As a result, we are seeing a major shift to quarterly and annual contracts. In May of 2012, when the merger closed, 99.6% of our Premium Listers were monthly. By January 2013, only 86% were monthly, 10% were quarterly and 4% were annual. That's a lot of progress on a pretty big client base in a pretty short period of time. Another important initiative we're undertaking is shifting our Premium Lister sales efforts from business-to-consumer-like sales to the individual broker and instead, we're focusing on a more business-to-business sale similar to CoStar, where we sell to the firm, not the individual. Individual brokers may see their listings come and go, but a collection of brokers or firm are more likely to have a more stable level of listings. As a result, a firm has a more stable demand for a marketing service from LoopNet and is less likely to cancel. We have adopted a pricing schedule to incentivize brokerage firms to buy firm-level deals by giving them significant volume discounts. Our firm-level sales of LoopNet Premium Lister are handled by our CoStar field sales force. In the month of January, for example, this year, 32% of Premium Lister sales were at the firm level on annual contracts sold by the CoStar field sales force. The remainder of January's Premium Lister sales were to individuals, with 34% sold by the traditional LoopNet inside sales team, 11% sold from the traditional CoStar Washington D.C. inside sales team and the remaining 23% sold via e-commerce. As we see a greater shift to firm-level sales and annual contracts, again, we expect our cancellation rate to decline. You can clearly see early evidence of our progress in reducing LoopNet's historically high cancellation rates. From the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2012, we reduced the overall monthly premium membership cancellation rate from 6.1% to 5.6%. Our fourth quarter 2012 Premium Lister cancel rate of 3.8% monthly was the lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. And the December cancellation rate of 3.4% is the lowest monthly cancellation rate seen in 5 years, which I believe is the only monthly data we actually have. So it's a pretty good number compared to history. It will take several years for all these different initiatives to really roll through the whole system so we get the full benefit, but we're seeing it already in the first 2 quarters of the effort. So at the same time that we're lowering LoopNet cancellation rates, we are also achieving significantly higher average new sales prices. From the third quarter to the fourth quarter 2012, we increased the average new sales price for LoopNet premium membership 23% from $56 to $69 per month. From the third quarter to the fourth quarter 2012, we also increased the average new sales price for LoopNet Premium Lister 13% from $75 to $85 per month. We're also now having good success selling SHOWCASE bundled with LoopNet Premium Lister. We're able to achieve the LoopNet-Cityfeet newspaper distribution bundle add-on sales with a good price premium on approximately 30% of all of our PL sales. Historically, LoopNet has always forced anyone wishing to buy Premium Lister, which as you know is an advertising product, to also buy Premium Searcher with it, which is an information product. We believe that there are many potential subscribers for LoopNet's advertising service that have no need to search for property information or not premium property information. These prospects may be discouraged from buying because they face a high entry-level price point for Premium Lister because of the bundled information product. We intend to unbundle the Premium Searcher service from the Premium Lister service this year. We will still offer a discount to a client wishing to buy both. But for those clients with only one property who are only interested in generating exposure and leads for that property, we will be able to offer them a more aggressive price. An overwhelming majority of brokers panked [ph] market listings on LoopNet, only market a subset of listings they have because LoopNet's current pricing scheme charges the broker the most money to advertise their least valuable properties. So basically, we have very -- we have weak penetration into our own advertising-broker client base's listing pool. Currently, LoopNet Search purchased on a monthly contract costs $82.95 a month. If a broker needs LoopNet search service and has 2 listings they need to market, they might consider buying LoopNet's Premium Lister product, which as I mentioned, includes Premium Search, and will give them valuable marketing exposure for 1 or both of those listings. The 2 listings are not likely equal. One listing is likely to offer a higher or easier commission to earn, while the second usually is harder to sell or lease and might yield a lower commission. If the broker chooses to market just the more valuable listing, they will only need a Premium Lister One listing plan, which costs $89.95 a month. So effectively, they will be getting LoopNet Premium Lister exposure for that one listing for just $7 a month, which is the difference between Premium Searcher price and the Premium Lister 1 price. That's a phenomenal deal, especially if you're only paying $7 a month to market a $20 million asset sale. Now in order to get exposure for that second less valuable listing, the broker will need the next higher listing plan, which is the Premium Lister 4 listing plan, which costs $149.95 a month with a 1-month commitment. So effectively, they will pay $69 per month for their second less valuable listing when they only had to pay $7 a month for the first listing. LoopNet's pricing plan has the effect of charging you more for your less valuable listings, hence most brokers only advertise a subset of their properties. In 2013, we intend to offer a new pricing plan that allows you to advertise each successive listing at a lower price. We believe that such pricing will allow us to achieve higher penetration into the existing advertisers' pool of listings. Another opportunity we have to price the LoopNet's products more effectively is by addressing the longer-term clients, many of which have never received a price increase and many of whom pay less than half of the current list price. For example, though the list price for Premium Searcher is $82.95 a month, more than 2,700 LoopNet clients pay less than $30 a month for the service. Over the years, LoopNet has dramatically improved the product but has never put through even a CPI-level price increase, thereby effectively reducing their price each year while offering more and more service. Over the course of 2013, our sales teams are expected to contact these super discount clients and offer them new pricing plans that continue to extend a good discount but not such a large discount. We have a number of other improved pricing strategies or advertising opportunities we believe we can develop and sell in the LoopNet marketing platform. And we'll update you on these developments during the course of the year as we get closer to rolling them out. There really are some exciting and somewhat obvious things we can do, but I want to keep the call under 4 hours in length. I believe it's apparent that Premium Lister sales are going to significantly and positively impact CoStar Group's revenue growth and margin expansion going forward. Now that we have had 10 months to evaluate LoopNet's Property Comps and Property Facts information products, we do not feel with these products warrant significant future investment. Both of these products have cancellation rates approximately twice that of Premium Lister and achieve price points that are 1/2 of Premium Lister's. In focus groups and client meetings, we hear significant dissatisfaction with the quality of the unresearched data these products provide. We believe that because of client dissatisfaction with LoopNet's Comps and Facts products when they're sold in bundle with our core LoopNet products, Lister and Searcher, they have a drag-along cancellation rate that hurts the otherwise healthy products. Given the extremely low price point of the products, we do not see an exceptional ROI in investing and upgrading the research on these products. We have already stopped commissioning our sales teams on selling the products, and we plan to stop selling new accounts this year. We may eliminate the products altogether at some point in the next 12 months. We believe that though we may initially lose revenue if we shut down these products, we will be able to recapture most, if not more than all of that revenue, with CoStar COMPS and Property subscription sales. The recaptured revenue in CoStar products is expected to be at a much higher margin, and I believe that customers will be much more satisfied with the quality of the CoStar information products. I want to now turn to the United Kingdom where we've had some pretty important developments over the course of the last 4 months. In the fourth quarter, we introduced CoStarGo and CoStar's full suite of information products to a select group of our existing clients in the United Kingdom. We rolled out CoStar Suite and CoStarGo in many of the U.K. clients in 5 cities, reaching approximately 600 of the 1,100 users we authorized in about 100 client firms, which is about 6% of our U.K. client base. So it's basically a small prelaunch group. I have personally had the opportunity to present the product to at least 400 U.K. clients. And the initial reaction has been extremely positive, including really good accolades for CoStarGo, as well as for our high-quality, comprehensive data. I'm pleased to say that several months later, we can report that over the past 4 weeks, more than 600 of our U.K. clients are logging in and using either the new U.K. CoStar Suite or CoStarGo or both. That tells me that we have remarkable early adoption to the new product. In February, we began an aggressive sales and marketing campaign for the entire U.K. Our target audience consists of the remaining 1,400 or 94% of client firms we did not see in December and give a trial to, as well as 2,000 additional firms that are not currently clients. I believe that these groups represent over 20,000 prospective users. Over the course of the past few years, our annual revenue has been approximately $20 million in the U.K. We believe the U.K. market opportunity is 3x to 4x that, and we believe that we're the only firm well positioned to realize that opportunity. As CoStar continues to enjoy rapid growth, we're continuously developing and evolving our executive team to most effectively meet the opportunity we have. This quarter, we have a number of additions and promotions on our executive team. Now that we have acquired a number of firms in the United Kingdom, consolidated their operations, built a research product on par with the quality we have in the U.S., and have integrated the U.S. and U.K. software platform, our primary focus going forward is taking what we believe is the best-theory information platform available in the U.K. and maximizing sales of that product. Giles Newman, a sales-focused executive, is replacing Paul Marples as Managing Director of CoStar Europe. I feel Giles is the perfect person to take responsibility for the success of our U.K. operations and sales of CoStar across the United Kingdom and eventually, Europe. Giles has a wealth of experience operating at established, high growth companies, holding senior positions in various roles over 15 years. He joined CoStar from Informa, where he was Group Sales Director for the Business Information division. Prior to that, he was leading global sales for a major division of Thomson Reuters, with a team responsible for $400 million in sales right across 18 countries. Another name you might recognize, I'm pleased to announce that Frank Carchedi has been named Executive Vice President of Operations for CoStar. As Exec VP of Operation, Frank holds overall responsibility for the ongoing integration and operations of all of the CoStar business units. He will work closely with me to identify and achieve greater operational effectiveness across the entire organization. Frank believes that all spending is bad. As some of you know, Frank served as CoStar's Chief Financial Officer for 10 years. Most importantly, he served as Senior VP, Corporate Development, where he successfully closed, integrated and managed various company acquisitions. This past quarter, we also welcomed Donna Tanenbaum to CoStar as VP of HR. As a member of CoStar's senior leadership team, she will lead the organization's efforts to acquire, train, develop, retain the best talent capabilities that we need to meet the company's strategic growth plans. Most recently, Donna served as VP of Human Resources for Curtiss-Wright Flow Control Company, a $1 billion engineering and manufacturing business that more than doubled in size through organic and acquisitions during her tenure. She has a Master's Degree in Education, Organizational Behavior, from Harvard and a Bachelor of Science from Cornell. Fred Saint was named President of LoopNet. Fred is responsible for the company's product, marketing, business plan and product roadmap. Fred joined LoopNet in '07 with the acquisition of Cityfeet, where he was the CEO of that company. He holds an MBA in Finance and Real Estate from The Wharton School in the University of Pennsylvania, and he did his undergraduate at Wake Forest. Curtis Kroeker was promoted to President of Marketplace Verticals, that's BizBuySell and land marketplaces. He joined LoopNet as General Manager of BizBuySell in 2010 when he -- where he drove continued growth and success of the Internet's largest business-for-sale marketplace. Curtis formerly served as the General Manager of the Vehicles Business of eBay Motors. And he also was VP of Business Development for Wildfire Interactive and he's an old consultant with McKinsey & Company. He's actually pretty young, but that was his first job. He holds an MBA from Tuck Business School at Dartmouth College and a Bachelor of Commerce Degree from the University of Calgary. During the fourth quarter, we held a multi-day off-site planning meeting with all the developers from LoopNet and CoStar. I believe that, without a question, we have assembled the most formidable commercial real estate development team ever. It was a very positive and productive meeting focused on the continuing integration of CoStar and LoopNet systems, with a number of exciting and impactical major software initiatives that we had talked about for 2013 and beyond. Now that we're 10 months into the merger, it's clear that LoopNet development technical team is a major asset the combined company can draw on to fuel high-margin growth in the future. I had the opportunity to present our developers what I thought was very good, detailed multi-thousand page product specification design layout for what we're calling CoStar Fusion, which is basically the next generation of CoStar Property. Our goal is to create a highly integrated, customizable user interface that will allow you even better access to our massive property database, coupled with amazing analytics. Users will be able to access the entire CoStar family of services in one platform. Rather than 1 big bang launch date, we are working on a series of smaller enhancements for the integration of our service offerings. Each quarter or so, we plan to release one of these manageable upgrades, adding new features and functionality, new design, look and feels and integration improvements. Ultimately, after about a dozen or so releases, it'll form and entire top to bottom redesign of our product over the course of several years. We're also launching a new video tour service to help brokers and owners market their properties online. We have trained our CoStar field researchers, about 100 or so of them, to take high-quality video tours of the inside of properties. We plan to charge for these walk-through space tours. And in order to market them, they'll have to have a LoopNet Premium Lister account for the property. And at that point, the video will move throughout our network, SHOWCASE, Cityfeet, CoStar and LoopNet. I'll take a moment to update you on the commercial real estate recovery, because I think that's very important to our business. The recovery continues at a moderate pace, which is great for CoStar. For each of the 4 largest property sectors tracked by CoStar, including office, multifamily, industrial and retail, we saw steadily improving demand and double-digit gain in investment transaction activity on a year-over-year basis for all major property types during 2012. CoStar is the leading player in information analytics across all the biggest commercial property sectors today. Some brought in discussion of how the property sectors are faring in looking at the demand drivers for each sector, which will give us a good picture of the demand for these property types, and in turn, of how CoStar products should fare in that environment in 2013. Office sector continued its long march to recovery in 2012 with vacancy rates declining 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 0.6% for the year as a whole to end up at 12.3%. Demand was 24 million square feet in the fourth quarter, which was up from about 14 million square feet in the third quarter. And on a year-over-year basis, demand growth was solid at 59 million square feet, an increase of 19 million square feet over 2011. That's real positive momentum. The big increase in demand growth ties in with the primary demand driver for office space, office employment, which increased at a solid 2.1% annual pace in 2012. That is 30% higher than the 1.6% rate of job growth in the overall economy and better than in 2011. The high rate of job growth to the office sector is reflective of a broad, long-term shift in employment towards service and high value-add knowledge employment, which tends to be located in office buildings. So office-using employment growth that outstrips overall employment growth, that's good news for us. There is a lag between when a job is created and when a company decides to lease more space and look for it, lease it and finally move in. This lag between office employment growth and an increase in absorption is typically about 2 quarters. So the strong office job growth in 2012 bodes well for an increase in leasing activity in 2013. Overall, the recovery is very widespread now. Even in markets that were hardest hit by the recession, such as Atlanta and Phoenix, we are now seeing a sustained recovery in office absorption. I think we leased space in both of those markets this year, but it wasn't us. Improving occupancy in 2012 began to generate increasing rents, a welcome change for our clients who earn revenue based on commissions from rental rates. Office rents rose 1.7% with most of the growth concentrated in top tier buildings and locations. This is contributing to increased investor interest in office properties. Sales volumes are up 9% from last year. And CoStar's repeat sales index shows a solid 5% increase in office values over the past years. Turning to multifamily. As most of you know, CoStar launched coverage of the apartment market in late 2012. We believe our research is the most in-depth available from any research firm in the market and it's been very well received by our customers, which is great news. Our launch was well-timed as investors are very hot on multifamily investment and development right now. Over the course of the next 2 quarters, we plan to increase the amount of data and analytics available over the CoStar website. And I'm very excited about the insights we were able to provide managers, lenders and investors in multifamily properties. The fundamentals of the apartment sector closed 2012 at a very strong level, with net absorption totaling 130,000 units nationally. This marks a 5% demand increase from 127,000 units absorbed in 2011. For comparison, demand in 2012 was 25% above the long-term trend for multifamily, which is the only property sector with 2012 demand exceeding long-term averages. This strong growth in demand has pushed vacancy rates to 6.1% in '12, down by 40 basis points. In comparison, the long-term average vacancy rate for the sector is 6.3%. In fact, multifamily is the only sector to have vacancy rates below the long-term average. These tight vacancies in the apartment sector makes sense as the primary demand drivers for the multifamily sector, total employment and household formation, increased at nearly the same rate in 2011, and new construction has been very low for over 2 years. For the apartment sector, a new job typically translates to a newly rented apartment very quickly, so the lag between supply and demand is much shorter than it is for other property types. Also aiding apartment demand is a secular trend, the continued decline in national homeownership rate. That rate is 66.4% versus 69.2% during the housing boom. And the decline has been a key driver of the robust demand for rental housing over the last 2 years. Rent growth for multifamily was strong, with a 4% increase, again outperforming rent growth in all the other property types. Robust investor interest in multifamily pushed the CoStar repeat sales index prices up 7% in 2012 on top of the 17% rise in 2011. Multifamily sales increased by 28% over the year to $83 billion, which was double the growth rate for other property sectors. So we're really pleased to now have a strong product offering there to take advantage of this little boom here. The fundamentals for the overall industrial sector closed 2012 very much as they did 2011, with vacancy rates falling approximately 70 basis points in both years, from 10.4% to 9.6% in 2011, and then to 8.9% by the end of 2012. For warehouse property, properties vacancies are firm in the single digits, 8.4% at the end of the year 2012, down from 9.2%. So we're seeing a steady recovery in the industrial sector for both flex and warehouse properties.  Net absorption for the warehouse sector totaled 123 million square feet in 2012, which is about 12 million square feet or 10% better than 2011. Much of the demand was back-loaded to the last quarter of the year. The industrial sector strongly correlated to the overall economy, and the weak recovery to date has led the industrial sector to grow below its potential. In 2012, demand for warehouse space was still 25% below the average of the previous recovery. Industrial rent growth was 1.7% in 2012, the first full year of rent growth in the sector since the recession. Investor interest has been moderate versus interest in offshore multifamily, with the repeat sales index showing a 2% increase in value. Total sales volume was only up 15% to $44 billion, which is about 1/3 shy of the record number seen in '07 but on par with the average trading volume of the previous 2 years, '05 and '06. Increases in sales volume often lead to price increases, as we've certainly seen in the for-sale housing market. So this increase in sales volume coupled with rising investor interest in the segment bodes well for 2013 value gains. Retail is finally showing significant signs of improvement. Retail properties on average are seeing accelerated absorption, declining vacancies and increasing volume of property sales. The fundamentals of the sector were soft but positive, with 34 million square feet of net absorption in 2011 -- 2012 and more than 50% increase from the roughly 22 million square feet posted in 2011. While this is good news, the retail sector is in a fairly deep hole right now, as the 2012 net absorption rate was only 1/3 of the long-term average. Retail real estate is facing headwinds from increased online shopping, with e-commerce posting average annual growth rate of roughly 16% over the past years. While e-commerce still only represents 7% of total retail sales, excluding auto and gas, retailers see the handwriting on the wall and are downsizing their formats and being very selective about opening new stores. So while e-commerce is good for consumers, it is not necessarily good for filling vacant retail space. The main driver of demand is the consumer and ultimately retail sales, which grew at a moderate pace, up 3.8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 3.8% is slower than the retail sales growth posted at the beginning of 2012 and helps explain the relatively weak absorption last year and probably foreshadows sluggish demand in 2013 for that sector. Fortunately, retail is not the biggest part of our business. But while the demand for space is weak, construction activity in retail is even weaker. Vacancy rates are declining modestly, down by 0.2% in the fourth quarter, 7.2%. Investor interest in the retail sector, though, is strong, with overall fundamentals -- with sales volumes up 13% to $70 billion. Retail pricing from the CoStar repeat sales index rose by 8% in 2012 versus 7% in 2011. Could be a little bit of a disconnect there. That may seem a little nonintuitive, but if you delve deeper into the data, you see the investors are buying the highest quality, well-occupied assets, particularly prime shopping malls. 2012, shopping malls accounted for 40% of retail investment dollars compared to an average of only 21% in '09 to '11. So overall, we are very happy with the current econ- -- despite the fact that we sit here in Washington D.C. with a potential sequester, we're overall very happy with where the commercial real estate economy is right now. And it's, I would consider, a positive environment for continued sales growth. So in conclusion -- I'm going to wake Brian up here, and conclude. Surpassing the $100 million revenue mark in 1 quarter was a great milestone for us to reach. But its true importance is as a proof point of the enormous size of the market we've been describing to you for many years. I'm confident that we're on our way to reaching our goal of a $500 million annual revenue run rate and 30% to 35% margins when we exit 2014. In fact, we believe $1 billion in annual revenue is a very achievable number in the foreseeable future for CoStar Group. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer.
Brian J. Radecki: Wow. Thank you, Andy, I think that was a new record. Just like when we used to present. Okay, I'll try to go fast here. As Andy mentioned, we're very pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and full year. Ongoing progress with LoopNet integration has had a very positive impact on the financial results for the quarter and the year. Starting with CoStar Group's results for the fourth quarter of '12, the company recorded $100.1 million of revenue, an increase of $33.9 million or 51% compared to the $66.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. Full year revenues were $349.9 million, an increase of $98.2 million or approximately 39% over revenues of $251.7 million for the full year of 2011. Now looking at pro forma organic revenue growth. CoStar's organic revenue growth was approximately 11% for the full year of 2011 and has now grown to over 13% for the fourth quarter of 2012, mostly due to the strong cross sales of CoStar services into LoopNet customer base. While LoopNet's organic revenue growth was in the 10% to 11% range prior to the acquisition, it has now grown to almost 13% in the fourth quarter of 2012, helped by the site-level Premium Lister sales by the CoStar field sales force and the other changes that Andy outlined in detail. Therefore the overall pro forma organic growth rate for the company grew from approximately 11% in 2011 to 13% in 2012, and that growth was driven by the cross-sales efforts. As we have stated over the past few quarters, we believe it could take several years to systematically move through this massive pool of leads. And therefore, we believe we can maintain double-digit organic revenue growth in that range of 11% to 13%, or possibly higher, over the -- of course, over a much larger and growing subscription revenue base, for the next 3 to 5 years. We expect it will be a sustained and consistent pattern of double-digit revenue growth versus a one-time pop in the growth rate. EBITDA increased 86% year-over-year to $20.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $25.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, an increase of $9.1 million or 57% compared to the $16 million for the fourth of 2011. And adjusted EBITDA margins are starting to climb at $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus $24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. We believe the earnings potential of the combined business is evident, and I expect continued strong earnings growth in 2013 as we take further actions to capitalize on revenue opportunities and cost synergies from the LoopNet acquisition. As Andy stated, as of today, we've achieved approximately $18 million in annualized cost synergies and have additional initiatives already in process, which will bring us over the $20 million. Obviously, we have obtained these synergies much, much earlier than the 24 months we discussed at the time we announced the acquisition. Non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2012 of $12.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share, was a 50% increase over the $8.4 million or 33% -- $0.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income of $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 reflects an increase in amortization and interest associated with the LoopNet acquisition. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and all the non-GAAP financial metrics discussed on this call to their GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms, in our press release issued yesterday and are available on our website at www.costar.com. And I'm sure that's a little bit more exciting than Andy's website. Cash and investments increased $25.9 million to $177.7 million as of December 31, 2012, up from $151 million at the end of the third quarter 2012. Cash and investments exceeded total short-term and long-term debt of $170.6 million as of December 31, 2012. Cash flow from operating activities was a very strong $29.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $86.1 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, which demonstrates the strong cash flow profile of our business. Cash flow from operation activities was a very strong $29.6 million -- oh, wait. Sorry, I already read that. At this point, I'm going to give you some operating metrics for the combined business as highlighted in our strong performance for the quarter. Annualized net new subscription sales for the entire company totaled $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, up 27% from the $8.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Consistent with last quarter, this metric includes only net new subscription sales from annual contracts and does not include monthly or quarterly subscriptions. Revenue from subscriptions on annual contracts was $72 million for the fourth quarter or 72% of revenue, up from 71% last quarter, and we expect that to continue to rise as we sell annual contracts. For the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2012, subscription revenue totaled $271.2 million, up 15% from $235.7 million for the 12-month period ended 12/31/2011. At this point, we have approximately 72% of our revenue coming from annual subscriptions, with the remaining 28% primarily made up of revenue from marketing services including LoopNet premium Lister on monthly or quarterly agreements, CoStar's SHOWCASE, as well as revenue from advertising across both platforms. We continue to make progress cross-selling LoopNet subscriptions on the 1-year contracts. And again, we expect the increase in the amount of marketing revenue to be included in our subscription revenue metric moving forward. Renewal rates on annual subscriptions remained very high during the quarter. 12-month trailing renewal for CoStar subscription-based revenue remained at 94%, consistent with the all-time high we reached in the third quarter of 2012. 94% is about a 1% improvement from 93% 1 year ago. The renewal rate for CoStar subscribers who have been with us for 5 years or longer remained at a remarkable 99%, matching the all-time high we've reported the last 2 quarters. In previous calls, I mentioned the pending negotiations with Grubb & Ellis, with the Grubb & Ellis contract that was in bankruptcy. In January, we reached an agreement with Newmark Grubb Knight Frank for a new 2-year commitment, which is expected to only have a small impact on our revenue and renewal rates. At the end of the fourth quarter, the existing CoStar business had 97,193 subscribers, up from 93,396 in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 1,625 subscribers from the third quarter of 2012. Total number of subscriber sites in the existing CoStar business increased to 20,211 in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from 18,183 in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 833 sites from the third quarter of 2012. Little update on the sales force. Last quarter, we spoke in detail about the evolution of the sales force, the creation of the HQAE role, with the intent of getting more sellers in the field. In total, we ended 2012 with 355 sales reps, a 4% increase over the third quarter. So the field plus anyone who's teamed and adds, are essentially 186 sales people now inside, with 25 on the East Coast and 118 at LoopNet, total of 143. We've got about 18 in the U.K. and 8 in various other parts to equal the 355. Again, we'll plan on continuing to move more people from inside to the field.  For all the Loopsters still on the call, the LoopNet Marketplace continues to be the premier website for marketing commercial real estate. The number of LoopNet premium members for the fourth quarter of 2012 increased to 81,396, up 7,846 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The average revenue per paying subscriber or, my favorite term, ARPU, was $66.73 for the fourth quarter. As noted in our press release, the ARPU for new premium subscribers was $69 in the fourth quarter, up from $56 in the prior quarter. LoopNet registered users, including basic and premium -- this is Jon Coleman's favorite number -- totaled 6.7 million as of December 31, 2012, up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2011. And now, a legal update from our General Counsel, Jonathan Coleman. This is about the 7th inning stretch, so if you want to go to the bathroom, you want to take a break, you guys can do that now. In January 2012, LoopNet was sued for patent infringement by CIVIX, which is a nonpracticing entity or something called "a patent troll." I'm not sure what trolls look like, but this is what Jon wrote. CoStar inherited this lawsuit with the acquisition of LoopNet when it was finalized. In a response to CIVIX' allegations CoStar's products also infringed on the patent, CoStar has since filed its own lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment against CIVIX. These cases, as well as another lawsuit CIVIX filed against LoopNet, are now pending. CoStar intends to defend itself vigorously against these claims and believes neither the company nor LoopNet has infringed on the CIVIX patents and that the patents are invalid. Now just one quick point note on the income statement, and then I'll move on to the outlook to keep this moving. People should note, gross margin percentage was 68.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 1.8% increase year-over-year compared to the fourth quarter 2011. Again, I eventually sort of will expect to see that number climb over the 70% mark. Just a phenomenal number. The outlook. I'll now discuss the outlook for the first quarter and full year. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, growth rates, renewal rates, and may be impacted by the overall economy, conditions in commercial real estate or the global economy. Actual results may vary from the estimates. We expect revenue for the first quarter of 2013 in the range of $101 million to $103 million. And for the full year, we expect revenue of approximately $424 million to $429 million. This range equates to about 21% to 23% year-over-year revenue growth. And included in that is the similar 11%, 12%, 13% organic growth on a much larger base, as I stated earlier, which we believe we can maintain this sort of growth rate for years and years to come. In prior quarters, I've discussed plans to consider alternatives for certain services for the 2 companies that overlap or create confusions for our customers. As Andy mentioned, we began looking at that process in '12, and we expect to continue to deemphasize or eliminate some of those services in '13, as Andy mentioned. We expect the impact -- the near-term impact to reduce our 23 revenues -- 2013 revenues by $5 million to $7 million, with an annualized impact of $10 million to $12 million 2014. While these decisions are expected to lead to the short-term impacts in revenue and earnings in the current year, we remain confident, in the long term, these will be accretive over time as we'll convert many of these customers to higher-value, more profitable annual subscription services. Our guidance on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, I had this a few years ago, on our top line results remains consistent. I do not try to predict foreign currency fluctuations. Our guidance assumes little or no volatility to the current rate. The average exchange rate from the U.K. in the fourth quarter 2012 was 1.6 and that's what I put in my budget and that's what my guidance is based on. If exchange rate remain at the current level of $1.50 to GBP 1, I would expect an impact on the revenue line of $1 million to $1.2 million, which is accounted for in the range. Obviously, if that rate went crazy like it did back in, when was it, 2008, it can have a bigger impact, but I'm not trying to budget for that each quarter so you guys can figure that out. In terms of earnings, we expect the first quarter 2013 fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.41 to $0.45 based on 27.8 million shares. For our business, the first quarter expenses include, as we've talked about many times, seasonally higher costs related to our annual sales conference, increased marketing expenses to support the LoopNet cross-sell efforts and sort of annual increases for personnel expenses. We assume a 38% tax rate in the long-term effective rate. For the full year 2013, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.08 to $2.20, based on 27.8 million shares. The outlook does include the reduction of approximately $0.08 to $0.12 in non-GAAP net income per diluted share for deemphasizing or eliminating these services I mentioned. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest in improving our services marketing and further evolving the field sales force. As mentioned in the earnings release, the company may begin to occur additional equity comp expense related to the issuance of performance stock ramps issued in early 2012, which vest upon achievement of certain performances earnings goals. The accounting for this type of stock requires that we start recognizing the expense when achievement of the performance goals becomes probable based on management estimates. We expect a onetime catch-up expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million beginning in the initial quarter we determine achievement of the performance goal is probably, and on a straight-line expense of $2 million, $3 million over the expected remaining quarters. The stock-based compensation does not impact our non-GAAP net income per diluted share or adjusted EBIT numbers for the guidance I just put out. In summary, I'm very pleased with our 2013 results, which include 8 months of LoopNet operations that provide insight into the strong revenue and earnings potential of the combined business. With our integration activities already directly contributing to strong earnings, we are well on our way to delivering the synergies we expected, both cost and revenue, when we announced the deal. More importantly, based on accelerating cross-sell activities, we remain confident in the revenue opportunities that are achievable by integrating these 2 great businesses. We see the enormous potential for growth as the industry's leading platform for commercial real estate, the most complete and growing set of services for the industry. Based on the revenue and earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year, I believe we are well on our way to the medium-term goal of $500 million run rate in annual revenues by the end of 2014 with adjusted EBITDA margins of 30% to 35%. Just to convert that for you --
Brian J. Radecki: That was my line.
Andrew C. Florance: That was your line. But just to convert that for you, that means that Q4 2014, a $125 million quarter. So not $500 million for the year but $125 million quarter by '14. Now more than ever, we believe this is an achievable benchmark that sets us on a realistic path for the long-term $1 billion in high-margin revenue. As always, I look forward to sharing that progress with you in coming quarters. We'll now open it up for questions now that we've closed the last chapter of War and Peace.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Brandon Dobell.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I had like 3 questions but I forgot them all. A couple quick ones. From a commercial real estate brokerage point of view, how concerned are you guys about kind of the middle of the market? Small firms are obviously doing quite well, large firms are taking share. How exposed are you to firms in the middle, which seem to be where you find the most trouble or most attrition these days?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, we've been seeing that trend for over a decade now. So looking at brokerage rankings back -- in various city levels back 14 years ago, there used to be a middle-tier [indiscernible], they've been disappearing consistently. So obviously, we're getting good traction with the majors with those big renewals. And significant growth on the CB side associated with growth in their business. And then a lot of these LoopNet conversions we're getting are actually the smallest players. So the biggest single category we're getting is the 1-man, 2-man shop, so we're doing fantastic there. The 20-person shops on the LoopNet side are actually the slower conversion point. So it's sort of been our operating environment for a long time so we're not terribly concerned about it. We obviously work with those mid-level clients, try to help them progress, but not a big factor.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then as you look at the upsell, cross-sell kind of conversion opportunities, what's your strategy around people who initially push back or don't do anything? Is there kind of a hey-we-keep-coming-back-at-them kind of mentality? And what's been the kind of most common reason you've heard from people who don't want to do anything different versus what they have? I guess, what's reason right now, especially LoopNet users?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes. It's a fantastic question. So there is a decent pool of several thousand folks who we -- our sales people went and met with and tried to show the benefits of upgrading to CoStar Property. The ones who -- typically, where you get the slower sales cycle is with the 5- to 20-person firm. We are seeing those close, they're just taking a bit longer. Also we're going to get a chance to get 4, 5, 6 bites of this apple because we keep putting out upgrades of our software on the CoStar property side. We're bundling them together to have a number of interesting new features in each release so that gives us a reason to go talk to these people again. And then remember, we're talking to these people virtually every single day because they're in one of our websites everyday. We know who they are. We're tying the CRM systems together. And we can send marketing messaging to them. And again, this thing where -- it's really hard to understand for me, I imagine it's hard to understand for anyone on the call, but even though we're the same company and we're connecting these databases, they don't get that we've got twice as many listings in CoStar Property. If they got that, I believe that 60% of them would end up upgrading. We have time to basically move to that conclusion, especially with automated comparisons when they search online. So we are -- we sort of have a mantra at CoStar, which is, eventually they're going to buy. And we've always had that and we don't ever really go away.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then a couple quick ones for Brian. Should we think that the extra stock comp or incentive comp, does that change how we think about the share count? And I guess, my broader question, as you guys keep generating a lot of free cash, should we expect further delevering or do you think you have the right capital structure right now for the business?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. So basically, on the performance shares, yes, I mean, eventually -- I think, there are 300,000, 400,000 or something like that. So those will come into the share count when we earn them. So that will come into the share count when we earn them. Essentially right now, I mean, I believe if we continue to achieve the earnings targets we've set out here for '13 and in '14 that we've discussed with you guys many times and you guys know how confident we are in that, we'll meet this performance goal at some point in that time period. So yes, that'd come in then. And then the second question was -- remind me.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just using free cash for delevering, buying back stock or how do you think about the capital structure right now?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean, that's something we're going to evaluate each quarter this year and talk about with the board. I mean, obviously, we just closed the deal. Cash flow is obviously even stronger than we thought. It's hard to imagine $29.6 million in the fourth quarter. So that's something that we're going to evaluate and we'll get back to you guys on. I mean, obviously, we're sort of open to the discussion on all of the different various levers that you can pull in the capital structure. So we'll evaluate that and update you guys as the year progresses.
Andrew C. Florance: And at this point, given our workload, we have no short-term plans or even intermediate plans to do any significant acquisitions, but looking at our 2-decade track record, it's quite likely something could come up in the next several years that might impact our decision about capital structure.
Operator: And our next question is from Brett Huff.
John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: It's John Campbell in for Brett Huff. So if you guys could just provide just maybe a little bit more color on the U.K. market and just, I guess, profitability, near-term, in general. I mean, last quarter, you guys said that you've hit some pretty major milestones in the form of like database migrations and whatnot. And then just given you guys have seen some, I guess, nice success in the recent launch, I mean, is it fair to say that most of the investment and incremental spend should be just kind of tapering here and are we just any closer to that profitability inflection point near-term?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes, so I'll take a shot and let Brian jump in as well. We spent -- it's not dissimilar from what happened in the United States. So as we were ramping up in the United States, we invested, made significant investments into research ahead of subscriptions building up to cover that fixed cost nut. We were doing that in the United Kingdom over the last 4 or 5 years where they had 18 researchers and we ramped it up to probably 170 from 18 to build up the right quality of data. The nice thing is we now have credit for that in the marketplace. They're saying we definitely have the only outstanding source of data in the marketplace. That 170, probably about 50 of those folks are temporary employees and that will come on back down midyear. So down to a stable state somewhere in the 100-and-some zone. Also the software developers that we search and we're allocating a lot to the United States, the United Kingdom, along with a generous markup under GAAP rules, those folks are now moving over to other projects and other priorities in the United States. So that spend is coming way down. At the same time, we began moving off the initial install towards betas and trying to build a reference set to actually selling the product in February. And we have some promising early results in some of the product. I have a lot of confidence. I feel the sales team is making some good progress and I think we'll get some good sales number this year. And I think we will be able to, and as we move out of '13 into '14, start to show a return of investment, the same way we did in the United States after a big investment.
Brian J. Radecki: And just the short version of that is that essentially, you've got a lot of costs dropping off, we're increasing the revenue and sales. Obviously, the Giles promotion, that's focusing them on sales. My expectation would be that they will get to breakeven in profits over the next 12 to 18 months. So they'll still be a little bit negative this year but they will be positive next year and be contributing to EBITDA. So they should get to breakeven again in the next 12 to 18 months and be positive in '14 is the expectation and there's nothing less than that.
John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just my next question is back to the future Loop cross-sells. Can you guys just give us any kind of information or direction as far as when you might -- when we might expect that next release of leads?
Andrew C. Florance: When we might release more leads to the sales force?
John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Right.
Andrew C. Florance: They're now actually -- once we increase the territory set and define a bigger territory set and did those teams, we actually released the whole set to them probably, I don't know, maybe 2 months ago, 3 months ago. And there's still 100,000 folks in the pool. I think we still have, very approximately, 94,000 we have not met with. So we have full employment over here at CoStar sales.
John Campbell - Stephens Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then just the last question here. Andy, I think you said in mid-February, you guys closed about 2,500 cross-sell bills. If you could just maybe parse out how many of those were CoStar cross-sales to Loop users?
Andrew C. Florance: It was $10 million worth, and I -- do you have an actual number for that? I think it was 1,500, something like that. I don't want to give you a wrong number.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I think it was around 1,500 and we can follow up with the exact number on that.
Andrew C. Florance: I'd take an estimate of 1,500. We began focusing on the Premium Lister sales to CoStar, I think, probably about 3 or 4 months after -- I think 4 months after we started focusing on selling CoStar to LoopNet. And so that's just still ramping up.
Brian J. Radecki: So the 3 pieces, real quick, is $10 million of annual contracts, information services to Loop customers, $1.7 million of Loop marketing service to CoStar clients and then in addition to that, we had another $2.9 million successfully converting about 900 customers on annual site level PLs. So sort of total synergy revenue of $14.6 million, which converts to a total of like 1,500 or so customer -- paying customers. So pretty strong numbers at a short period time.
Andrew C. Florance: Yes. So using it as a rule of thumb on the average price, you come out to about 1,550.
Operator: Next question is from Bill Warmington.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: The long question for you on the fourth quarter annualized new contract revenue, $8.5 million that you reported. Now I seem to remember there were some onetime items in the fourth quarter that were likely going to depress that a little bit. And I just wanted to know -- you already covered the Grubb & Ellis as being one thing that could have done that. But I also wanted to ask about the RMS contract, to try to get to, I guess, what I would call a more normalized, what that number would have been without the RMS contract.
Brian J. Radecki: When Andy mentioned that, he was talking about just the CoStar business, so I think I put in mine it's the $10.9 million was the fourth quarter number. So that's a $10.9 million. And that accounts for everything. I would say that there was enough things going in each direction with Grubb & Ellis and RMS and everything else, so I actually think that the $10.9 million is a pretty good number. And that's up 26% year-over-year, so that's a great number.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And then your thoughts, and since we're 2/3 the way through the first quarter, your thoughts on where the annualized net contract revenue is likely to come in for the first quarter? Does it come in, in that basically $12 million to $13 million a quarter level? Or are we still going to be below the $12 million level?
Brian J. Radecki: Well, I'm not sure I want to give guidance on the fact that we're 2/3 of the way through the quarter, but that number was $10.8 million. If I read back the last 4 quarters, it was $10.8 million, $9.3 million, $7.9 million. So it's been growing. I'm not going to give a projection on that, but obviously we gave pretty strong healthy guidance for the year at 21% and 23%. In the first quarter, we do have sort of the resolution of the Newmark Knight Frank Grubb thing, we've got a lot of stuff in there. And then we will be -- we've already started, as Andy mentioned, to deemphasize some of these services. We don't sell some of these services in our sales groups anymore, so they're just on the Web. So throughout the year, we're sort of overcoming that and we're still going to come up with, I think, a very strong organic growth number. So we're excited. I think it's, like I said, 20% -- 21% to 23% revenue growth is a pretty good year.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And then I wanted to ask about -- you gave some detail on the organic growth at 13% for the CoStar piece and just under 13% for LoopNet piece. You've given some additional detail in the past. I just wanted to see if you could give us any additional color on those numbers?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, I mean -- they're great numbers. So we closed '11 at around 11% and so obviously, taking it up over a 13% is a great year, especially on a much bigger base. Again, a lot of that is the strong cross-sell, I mean, that we talked about in the LoopNet base. You got $10 million come in. Again, LoopNet prior to the acquisition, growing in that 10% to 11% range. Again, all the efforts that we've done and all the things that Andy talked about getting that up to almost 13%. So I think it was a sort of great organic year. And I've said this many times to people, as we've explained to you guys, that this is a huge lead list that we've met with 6% of barely, this is something that's going to roll out over years. This isn't a onetime pop and a big number and growth rates are going to go up by 3% or 4% or 5% and then dip back down. And because you got the bigger base, you actually have to produce another 1.5% to 2% every single year. So I feel very confident over the next few years in the medium term with this cross-sell opportunity being able to stay in that 11%, 12%, 13% range, even though the base is getting much bigger. And maybe we can do better than that but I think it's -- we feel very confident in that. And I think that's why we feel confident when we talk about $125 million fourth quarter of '14 or $500 million run rate. Going from $100 million in the fourth quarter this year to $125 million, I mean, I think it's a great goal.
Operator: Next question is from Suzi Stein.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You talked about the fact that you've achieved $18 million of the $20 million of cost synergies. And I guess the $20 million always struck me as kind of a low number. But how much over the $20 million do you think you can go? And I guess, more specifically, what are you experiencing in terms of savings that you didn't forecast prior to the merger?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. Suzi, it's Brian. So yes, I think, we actually spent quite a bit of time prior to the merger. So I think most of the things that we expected to come in have been coming in sort of as expected. I think they've just come in much faster than we expected. I think we've done a great job on the integration. I'd mentioned it on prior calls. I mean, we renegotiated insurance and we saved $0.5 million, $0.75 million. We still have other contracts, data agreements and things that they sort of signed up for that are already sort of in the pipe that will fall off. And that's why when I talk about the $18 million, I think we're essentially already at the $20 million with things that we already have sort of in process that will fall off. So the question is what can that be? Can it be a couple million dollars better than that? Yes, I think it can continue to get better. I don't think I'd put that in my guidance right now. I think we want to keep working through it. And the one thing that we talked about prior to the acquisition is that this deal, the $20 million or plus more than that of cost synergies wasn't the core driver behind the deal. What we always talked about was we thought we had multiples of that on the revenue side. And having already captured $14.6 million, I think we're sort of hopefully proving that concept out. And I think that's the true value in the deal is that, if you can do that number and you can sell on that lead list for the next 3 to 5 years and continue with double-digit revenue growth, and you look at lots of other peer companies and they're all in the single digits. I'm seeing like great quarters for companies with 3% and 4% and 5% organic growth rates. And I truly do believe we'll continue in these higher growth rate ranges. So we're pretty excited.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So then I guess the other question is just as you think about achieving these revenue synergies, you talked about the retraining and redeploying and I guess hiring of sales people to do that. How should we think about modeling selling and marketing over the longer term? So how long do you think it will remain at sort of an elevated level? And when does it normalize and what does it normalize to? If you're willing to talk about that.
Andrew C. Florance: I mean, we can't -- it's difficult for us at this point to tell you what's going to happen in '14 with that sales force, or '15, because we're going to want to get further down the road and get a better feel for what's working. But we are going to be seeing a fair amount of revenue -- we believe we're going to be seeing a fair amount of revenue growth here, a much larger customer base. We now have the ability to operate more efficiently in the field with a bigger scale. We are emphasizing more in-the-field sales presence. So we're going up towards the 200 field sales people mark with a reduction through attrition on some of the centralized sales. And then we'll evaluate it again there. And it's always going to be based upon what kind of return are we getting on each sales person. Are we getting a phenomenal return? We can look at that and feel pretty good about where we are at this level, and we'll evaluate again at the end of the year.
Brian J. Radecki: And just in dollars, Suzi, to give you a little color if you're talking about modeling it, obviously, it's going to grow in dollars because you're paying out sales commissions and we all expect to have -- I mean, I would hope we pay out lots of sales commissions, I'm sure there's a lot of sales people are loving to hear that, based on these growth numbers that we're talking about. So in dollars, it's going to grow but I do expect to see efficiencies and see it reduce as sort of a percent of revenue as you move forward. So hopefully, that will help you with your model a little bit.
Operator: Next question is from Marc Fuller.
Marc Fuller: Just kind of a quick question here. I'm trying to understand in terms of, so this quarter, you sold $10 million in annual contract value information services to LoopNet, who had previously only had $160,000 commitment? And then last quarter, I believe you said you kind of had sold $4 million in that to people who had previously committed $37,000? Is that right?
Andrew C. Florance: That is -- the $10 million number is since the merger. So we began the cross-selling probably, I don't know, 2 months after -- aggressively doing the cross-selling 2 months after the merger, something like that, July, August timeframe. So the first number, it's a cumulative number. So the first number of $4 million is where we were when we did the last earnings calls and we have incremented to $10 million since that last earnings call. So it's not a $10 million per quarter. It's cumulative.
Marc Fuller: Yes, so got that. So then the difference would be kind of 120,000 to $6 million, right? 120,000 can bring you to $6 million for a total of $10 million?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes.
Brian J. Radecki: And just real quick, this is Brian. The total amount was $4.6 million. As Andy said, we didn't start some of the other pieces, the LoopNet marketing services, existing CoStar clients. So some of that's just starting. If you just look at in total, you're going from your $4 million to $14.6 million. And again, the $14.6 million was in total so the $4 million is included in that. So that should give you a little bit better color on those numbers.
Marc Fuller: Got it, got it. Okay. So that makes a little more sense. Okay. And then just a quick -- I think I missed it, but what were the redundant services you were cutting that are included in that $5 million to $7 million?
Brian J. Radecki: Yes. I mean, right now, we're deemphasizing several services. I don't know, I won't get into a ton of detail on it, but I think Andy talked about Property, COMPS and Facts. We no longer sell-through our sales force, it's still available online. So those would be a couple of things. CoStar had some services, CMLS and e-COMPS that are no longer being sold on the web. So there's several -- I mean, we've been evaluating this since the deal closed. So we've actually been doing this, we just -- I'm not sure we've talked specifically about it til now. So there's several services that we're just no longer selling.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Todd Lukasik.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Just a question on the first quarter revenue guidance. I guess, $100 million this quarter, $101 million at the low end for next quarter. If you assume the net new sales kind of came in through the quarter, barring some kind of seasonality or other decline somewhere else, it seems like $101 million is a pretty easy bar to hit. Is there something going on there with seasonality or lost revenue otherwise that would account for that?
Brian J. Radecki: No, no. I mean, if you look, I did the same thing last quarter, essentially I raised it up $1 million over what we did and gave it a $2 million range. So I think it's just me being consistent and conservative. Obviously, I feel very comfortable with the low end of the range. So it's just more -- that's just more the way I guide. I'd rather be conservative on the guidance than be aggressive. And in the first quarter, we will have sort of workout of the Newmark, Knight Frank and some other things in there. But essentially, I think -- obviously, we expect pretty strong numbers for the year, so I'm pretty confident in that range.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then 100,000 prospects, and I think you mentioned you pitched 6,000 so far. How many do you think the sales team is pitching per quarter? Is that sort of around 4,000, 5,000 or what's a good number to think about there?
Andrew C. Florance: That's a good question. Hang on one second. He's got the calculator out. Yes, about -- roughly about 5,000.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then at this point, is the entire sales team sort of ramped up on the sales pitch and I guess, were they in the fourth quarter, or is there still some expected efficiency you get out of the sales force from here?
Andrew C. Florance: I do expect an efficiency gain from the sales force from here. So again, while the initial result exceeded our expectations, I am now in this weird place where I'm like, that wasn't good enough, we can do better. And I look at the nature of our sales presentation to these folks at this point and I see so much room for improvement. We began working on that really hard at the sales conference. And I expect that we can achieve higher close rates and it will take -- you're dealing with 2 audiences, both ingrained with 15-year behavior. So you've got the CoStar sales force who've been doing a particular kind of sales pitch for 10 or 15 years. And when they go into that LoopNet upsell situation, they have to completely change up their presentation and do it differently than they normally do it. That takes some behavior modification, which will probably take us a total of 12 months to really get them into. At the same time, they're going in and meeting with people who have really perceived something a certain way for 10 or 15 years, and you've got to reach them. So I think each quarter during 2013, you'll see improving close rates as we get better at this.

 I'll now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? 
Andrew Florance: Good morning, everybody, and thank you all for joining us. I'm very pleased to bring you news this morning of solid financial performance in the third quarter. Driven by both strong organic growth, along with the acquisition of LoopNet, CoStar's revenue for the third quarter increased 50% year-over-year to $96 million. 
 Third quarter EBITDA increased 227% year-over-year to $19.6 million. I would love to be able to say that every earnings call.
 In the third quarter, we added 948 new subscription customers, which is the largest number we have added in any quarter, so that's organic sales. This is the result of our sales team ramping up to take advantage of the opportunity to cross-sell CoStar into the LoopNet client base.
 Following our successful acquisition of LoopNet on April 30 this year, our single greatest priority as a company right now continues to be aggressively integrating the resources of LoopNet and CoStar together to capture what we see as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
 The combined company now has nearly 2,000 employees, and I believe that they see the potential these combined companies have, and they and we are all very excited about it.
 The commercial real estate industry is massive, with over 10 trillion in assets in the U.S. and the scale we need to address this opportunity is great.
 One of the best things about the merger at LoopNet is that it has enabled us to team up with several hundred new gifted colleagues who have the skills we need to succeed in our mission.
 I think it is safe to say that we all feel pretty lucky to be here in this company right now with this opportunity. And that's a good thing because right now, we have an awful lot of work to do here. 
 Prior to the merger, these 2 great companies were structured top to bottom to optimize the ability of each company to succeed, given the environment that existed before their merger.
 With this merger, that environment has been turned upside down and inside out for the better. But that means that our staff has to embrace a tremendous amount of change in order to ensure that we put the right talent in the right place doing the right job.
 I'm really proud to say that our team is doing a great job embracing the change and working through the inherent challenges in order to build the best company to serve the industry.
 I think it is remarkable how quickly this integration is coming together. I've seen a dozen-plus mergers up close, and this one is progressing at a faster pace than just about any I have seen before. A lot of credit for that definitely goes to a great leadership team on the LoopNet side.
 I have the entire LoopNet team to thank for supporting the vision of the inspiring potential of this combined company.
 Let me give you just a few examples of the level integration occurring. LoopNet had perhaps 2 dozen researchers tasked with finding commercial real estate listings to load into the LoopNet Marketplace, in an effort to drive greater participation. After the merger, that task made no sense because CoStar already had the vast majority of those listings in our database, and there was no need to collect data twice. The LoopNet research team spent several weeks in training, both in Washington and California, learning how to do research to support the CoStar information products.
 In addition, several experienced CoStar managers and researchers have moved to LoopNet's offices in California to further train and support these former Loopsters as they begin doing CoStar research. This was not easy, or a completely painless transition for all involved. But it has happened and it is working.
 The company has eliminated around $1 million of redundant cost in this area alone, has retained good talent and is improving our products in doing so. 
 Over the past quarter, the entire research team, with the support of our software team, has come through the entire LoopNet database and added 50,000 listings to the CoStar information products that have been missing prior. This should make our products even more valuable to our customers.
 Total listing count grew to 1.6 million in the third quarter from 1.5 million in the prior quarter.
 The newly combined companies now have significant telephone customer service teams in London, Washington and San Francisco. Each, separately, can effectively service customers in an 8-hour window, given that 2 of these centers support 5 time zones.
 We are integrating these 3 customer service teams into one virtual call group and are cross-training the teams. This means that a Chicago client will be able to reach of the customer service help from 2:00 in the morning, their time, until 9:00 at night, their time. Our goal is to have that 6 days a week. In addition, by increasing the pool, you need less standby staff to handle call searches. This means that through attrition, we can have fewer customer service reps, providing high-quality support over greatly expanded hours.
 CoStar has a multiyear pipeline of detailed product development specifications that we believe will become industry-leading tools that will drive even higher sales results in the future.
 Now that the companies have merged, LoopNet will be devoting even greater software resources to its innovative and profitable Internet marketing solutions, but will not need as many resources working on fledgling redundant information products.
 Both LoopNet and CoStar developed in the .net environment and have very similar technology stacks. More importantly, both companies have top flight software talents and management.
 Our technology teams have spent many hours post-acquisition briefing one another on how our respective companies' technology solutions are built. I think, it's probably not hours. I think it's probably days and weeks of briefings.
 This has been a great 2-way learning experience for the staff. This also means we can use some of the LoopNet software teams to bring CoStar products to market faster and vice versa.
 Several weeks ago, as we were attending a regularly scheduled half-day CEO software briefing session, when it dawned on the other side in that, I was listening to a LoopNet senior executive, Jerry Rodgers, brief me on the timing of the next major CoStar product release. So in several short months, people have taken cross responsibilities across the companies. It was a great briefing.
 Another area where I believe we are realizing extraordinary value is in the integration of our sales teams. Remember that we have very roughly about 80,000 to 100,000 good prospects currently using LoopNet that we want to cross-sell CoStar information products to.
 We have just started on that effort, but in addition, we have a similar scale craft -- similar scale task of crossing LoopNet Internet marketing solutions to CoStar users.
 Any way you look at it, we need a very large sales team to take advantage of this large opportunity. When we closed the deal, we had just over 200 CoStar sales reps, and now combined with LoopNet's team, we have almost 350 sales reps.
 The problem is that most of these salespeople were not tasked with selling the cross-sell products, the highest value products, which have the highest revenue potential post the merger.
 LoopNet was devoting a large number of sales resources to selling premium searcher property comps and property facts on monthly terms to individuals. These products have lower renewal rates and lower price points, so each unit sold is ultimately worth only several hundred dollars. That stands in sharp contrast to sales of CoStar information products, which have higher price points, firm level purchasing instead of individual purchasing, annual contracts instead of monthly and extraordinarily low cancellation rates.
 We believe that each subscription of CoStar Property sold can be ultimately worth approximately $50,000 to the company over time.
 Some of LoopNet's Premium Lister plans can be worth several thousand dollars per unit sold. I believe that LoopNet's Premium lister plans sold on annual contracts at the firm level might approach tens of thousand dollars in value per unit sold.
 It may have made sense to devote resources selling low-priced products to individuals when the companies were standalone, but it makes no sense now, when we believe that we have tens of thousands of potential sales with long-term values approaching $50,000 per unit.
 Obviously, there's a great opportunity to shift sales resources from the lower quality products to higher value ones.
 Often, within merging cultures, that is much easier said than done now. In this case, I think our sales organization is committed to doing the right thing and is making phenomenal progress.
 LoopNet has a number of strong sales professionals, and we have already promoted approximately 20 of them from selling these lower price subscriptions to field sales where they're selling CoStar and LoopNet Premium Lister at the firm level on annual contracts.
 In order to bring them up to speed as quickly as possible, we teamed them with senior CoStar sales professionals across the West Coast. We believe LoopNet Premium Lister has a higher value per unit sold than showcased, so we've trained 24 Washington based salespeople on selling LoopNet Premium Lister, and that is their primary role today.
 This is really significant because we are now successfully selling LoopNet from CoStar headquarters in Washington, as well as LoopNet's headquarters in San Francisco and their Glendora office, and throughout the field, too. 
 We have also promoted an additional 21 sales staff from our centralized group in HQ to field account executives and teamed them up with East Coast account executives, where they're now -- more senior East Coast account executives who have been in the field for a while, and they are now focusing on cross-selling our higher value products.
 We had 15 advertising salespeople, who, prior to the merger, only focused on selling enhanced marketing exposure within our CoStar products. They have now been trained in selling LoopNet Premium Lister and are selling it on annual contracts at the firm level. 
 In total, more than 100 CoStar and LoopNet salespeople have seen their sales responsibilities change significantly since the merger closed 6 months ago, so that we can take advantage of the higher potential that we have in cross-selling LoopNet and CoStar services.
 So with that, let's talk about actual cross-selling results to-date in these first number of months. In August, we began distributing LoopNet user lists to our sales team for cross-selling. Of the approximately 100,000 information cross-sell leads we're focusing on, we have only distributed about 16,000 to-date.
 The sales force has made contact only with a portion of those first leads, but they've already closed 723 deals selling CoStar information products to LoopNet users.
 Most of the LoopNet users we convert to CoStar contracts were premium users. They were paying nothing to LoopNet. 
 The others, which were the minority, were paying LoopNet a total of $37,000 a month for various combinations of information and marketing services, that they, in essence, could drop at any time. 
 They were not annual contracts. These people are now purchasing CoStar information services and LoopNet marketing services for $381,000 a month on annual contracts. That is a monthly billing increase of 930%, which is clearly a home run. Go, Giants.
 These clients' prior commitments was -- their prior commitment was only to pay LoopNet $37,000. Now, they have committed to annual contracts with us, with an aggregate commitment of $4.6 million. You can do the math, it's about 120-fold increase in contracted revenue from these users, much more stable, predictable revenue.
 The $381,000 of monthly revenue was comprised of $58,000 of LoopNet Premium Lister and $323,000 of CoStar information services.
 I have participated in a number of these sales, and these new customers appear to be very pleased with these new combined services.
 We are at just at the beginning phase of this effort. We currently expect the number of demos will increase significantly in the fourth quarter of 2012 and beyond. I know that we already have 500-plus scheduled out into the future. The company's sales force spent much of the third quarter of 2012 training, developing sales tools, reorganizing the sales force and forming new teams by an HQAEs.
 We look forward to reporting a full quarter of cross-selling activity in the fourth quarter, that we expect will improve on these initial numbers. Just to put some pressure on our sales management.
 While we have put a lot of focus into selling CoStar information products in this quarter, we also believe that we have significant growth ahead in LoopNet premium memberships. LoopNet's core business is performing extremely well in the quarter, with premium memberships up 2,783 during the third quarter to 80,062 premium members. That is the strongest membership growth LoopNet has seen since the third quarter of 2007.
 The growth in members is a 91% increase quarter-over-quarter, and a 112% increase year-over-year. I think one of the exciting things happening here is that for each of the 723 LoopNet users we upsold, we replaced them with 3 new ones that perhaps could be future upsell opportunities. It is a gift that keeps on giving.
 Historically, LoopNet experiences significant sales cycles with the first quarter being the best, and then each successive quarter moves downwards until the fourth quarter is normally LoopNet's most challenging quarter. That's sort of a long-term pattern with LoopNet.
 This quarter's result is significant, though, because we broke that historical downward trend in the third quarter. CoStar sales people and Washington HQ based centralized sales helped achieve that upward trend, along with the LoopNet traditional sales team, but that HQ team that was prior selling SHOWCASE in Washington, along with some East Coast star field sales reps, sold 555 premium memberships -- LoopNet premium memberships in the quarter that would not historically have happened for LoopNet.
 And the pace of that contribution is picking up. On top of the 555 units sold in the third quarter, CoStar sales people have already sold an additional 369 units in the first weeks of this month.
 LoopNet turned in its best-ever August, based on growth sales, and best since the March 2007 peak, based on net sales growth.
 We are now only selling CoStar's traditional Internet CRE marketing platform, SHOWCASE, as a bundled add-on to LoopNet's Premium Lister product. The LoopNet Premium Lister product will be our lead product going forward in this area.
 So SHOWCASE is being packaged with LoopNet and Cityfeet and national newspaper distribution plan, which includes 225 publications, like the Wallstreet Journal and the New York Times. So this becomes the LoopNet Premium Lister Gold package or combination package.
 24% of our new Premium Lister subscribers are now subscribing to enhanced bundle, which we've only very recently started selling.
 Overall, we believe we are very well-positioned to continue to drive sales and conversions of LoopNet and CoStar customers.
 I'm really, really pleased to be able to announce a major milestone in the U.K. We have now completed the migration of our U.K. property database to the same research system we use in the U.S., and we have now completed building CoStar Property Tenant comps and CoStarGo Go for the U.K. and will have completed it before the 10th anniversary of our being in the United Kingdom.
 This is a completely new product offering for the U.K. market, and we believe it'll be a huge competitive advantage for CoStar that will drive penetration of new customers and will lead to upgrades and increased retention among existing clients.
 We are doing a 2-stage launch of the products in the U.K. with the first release occurring in a 2-week series of marketing events across the U.K., starting November 5. The first release is a soft preview release available to 2,000 users at our higher revenue clients and is available to them at no cost. We're giving away a large number of iPads as we did in the U.S., in order to spur fast adoption and create buzz for the broader market.
 The official complete national launch will be on January 2, 2013. At that time, our remaining 10,000-plus users can upgrade from our existing focus software platform, the new CoStar platform, by paying a reasonable premium to their current monthly price. We believe that this release of our integrated international CoStar software platform will enable us to significantly accelerate our revenue growth rates in the U.K. and move us towards profitability there.
 In other news, in September, we launched our multifamily product, our apartment product. Multifamily is PPR's #1 property type by number of page views and report downloads, indicating that there is a lot of interest in this sector. It is one of the biggest asset classes of commercial real estate. We've dedicated approximately 40 research analysts to the multifamily team. The database includes over 50,000 multi-family properties with effective rent data and is growing really quickly. We have hundreds of thousands of apartment buildings in our database that we're enhancing with this current rent data vacancy data, et cetera. We believe that this is significantly more properties than anybody else in this space offers by a wide margin.
 The potential target market for this product at both the CoStar and PPR levels is vast. We believe this offering will give us deeper penetration with current and prospective clients, including banks, government agencies, CMBS investors, investment managers, REITs, municipalities and many others.
 We expect to release the enhanced multifamily data in our CoStar platform as well and in that sales channel in the first part of 2013.
 For the past 2 years, we have had research resources canvassing buildings in Toronto, Canada. In total, they have thoroughly documented 38,000 commercial properties for a total of 1.7 billion square feet of Canadian inventory. We have met with the major players in Toronto, and when they saw the technology we had to offer, they were very impressed.
 We are fairly confident, we do not believe -- or extremely confident, and we do not believe there's anything comparable covering commercial real estate in Canada. We believe we will launch the Toronto service in the first quarter of 2013.
 I want to stress, we have no current plans to expand any other markets in Canada or outside the U.S. right now, and we do not believe the Toronto expansion will materially negatively impact our margin expansion.
 This is a controlled expansion. 
 Current commercials estate market conditions remain positive for CoStar and most of our clients. While the economic recovery remains weak and we've not gained back all the jobs we lost in the downturn, office job growth is up over 2%, better than the overall economy and is positive for commercial real estate, whereas leasing activity is high due to inexpensive office space out there.
 Overall, the third quarter of 2012 looks very similar to the second quarter of 2012. In the office market, year-to-date, net absorption has been focused on top-quality buildings. It is still running fairly close to long-term averages. Net absorption for the quarter was 15  million square feet, which is in line with the current trends in the market.
 Across the nation, rents are only up 1% from the bottom, and actually showed a slight downward trend in the quarter; however, rents in some markets are up significantly, particularly, in technology and energy cities. Say, San Francisco rents, as an  example, have risen by 20% from the bottom, which is accelerating from last quarter's 16% increase.
 Overall, the commercial real estate economy is creating an acceptable business environment, in which we can pursue our top priority of cross-selling CoStar products to LoopNet users and LoopNet tools to CoStar clients.
 The cross-selling opportunities from the LoopNet acquisitions are now proven to be real and are driving significant new customer sales. As we move towards the end of the year and into 2013, we expect to continue to see the benefits of the LoopNet acquisition continue to unfold.
 We believe that our employees, clients, and most importantly, shareholders, will benefit as we continue to integrate the 2 companies. Grow profitably and move towards our goal of $500 million in revenue and 30% or more adjusted EBITDA margins as we exit 2014.
 I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brian Radecki.
 Just take a breath. Thanks, Andy. 
Andrew Florance: You're welcome. 
Brian Radecki: We're very pleased with our performance in the third quarter of 2012. This is the first full quarter we have LoopNet included in our consolidated financial statements, and the progress we're making in integration has already translated to synergies, showing up in both our revenue and earnings.
 Today, I'm going to principally focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter of 2012 and also on our outlook for the remainder of the year and into next year.
 Now to review the results for the third quarter, beginning with revenue. The company reported $96 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2012, an increase of $32.2 million, or 50%, compared to revenue of $63.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. CoStar's organic revenue growth remains strong in the 12% to 13% annual growth range during the third quarter of 2012; while LoopNet business, excluding purchase accounting adjustments, continued to achieve year-over-year revenue growth in the 10% to 11% range. Therefore, the combined businesses are operating in the 11% to 13% range.
 We're excited about the performance of the combined business and continue to look for ways to maximize our future revenue growth, as we re-prioritize our sales efforts and aggressively pursue cross-selling opportunities.
 Our non-GAAP net income earnings reached an all-time high in the third quarter for several key metrics we report, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. We believe the earnings potential for the combined businesses is evident, as I expect to see strong earnings growth year-over-year, as we take further actions to capitalize on synergies from both the LoopNet acquisition.
 EBITDA increased 227% year-over-year to $19.6 million in the third quarter, up $6 million -- up from $6 million in the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA of $25.6 million from the third quarter of 2012, which is an increase of $11.6 million, or 83%, from the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 26.7%, up from 21.9% in the third quarter of 2011.
 Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2012 was $13.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share, which is an increase from $7.2 million in third quarter of 2011 or 82% year-over-year. Net income increased to $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 or 196% year-over-year.
 Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to the GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms in our press release issued yesterday and is available on our website at www.costar.com. And if you have any questions on those in detail, you can e-mail Rich Simonelli at costar.com.
 Cash and investments increased $22.7 million to $151.8 million as of September 30, 2012, up from $129 million at the end of the second quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was very strong at $26 million for the third quarter of 2012, and $56.6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, which demonstrates the strong cash flow profile of our business. Short- and long-term debt totaled $170.6 million as of September 30, 2012.
 At this point, I'm going to give some operating metrics for the combined business, which highlight our strong performance in the third quarter. As we further integrate the businesses, we may adjust or introduce some new combined metrics.
 Annualized net new subscription sales totaled $9.3 million in the third quarter of 2012. We have slightly refined this metric to include only net new subscription sales from annual contracts but does not include the monthly or quarterly sales. 
 Revenue from subscription services on annual contracts in the quarter was $68.3 million for the third quarter of 2012 or 71.2% of our total revenue. This represents an increase of 14.2% organically from the $59.8 million in the third quarter of 2011.
 If you look at it on a trailing 12-months basis ended September 30, 2012, subscription revenue would have totaled $261 million, up 14.3% from $228 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2011.
 Renewal rates for annual subscription revenue remained very high during the third quarter. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for annual subscription revenue increased to 94%, actually up 0.3 percentage points from the 93.7% during the second quarter, which is a new record. The 94% is also a 1.4% improvement from 1 year ago.
 The renewal rate for CoStar subscribers who have been with us for 5 years or longer remained at a remarkable 99%, matching that all-time high we reported last quarter.
 As we discussed previously, we expect the cancellation of the RMS contract, a DMGI-owned company, to have a onetime impact on our revenue and renewal rate of approximately 1% in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 In addition, the ultimate resolution of the Grubb & Ellis contract, currently still in bankruptcy court, may impact our revenue renewal rate as we've discussed in the past few calls.
 At the end of the third quarter, the CoStar business had approximately 95,568 subscribers, up from 91,010 in the third quarter of 2011, and down slightly compared to the second quarter of 2012.
 While subscribers to our U.S.-based information services increased in the quarter, the small decline quarter-over-quarter is primarily attributed to the change in Showcase subscriptions. As Andy mentioned, we have combined our marketing services, are no longer selling Showcase as a stand-alone service.  We are now providing Showcase as a part of the expanded national distribution option for the LoopNet Premium Lister subscribers, and we expect the former existing CoStar Showcase subscribers to migrate into the subscriber counts of the LoopNet marketing subscriptions as we upsell them to this premium bundle.
 As we have discussed in prior calls, we expect to continue to make some moves to rationalize our combined portfolio, and this decision to stop marketing Showcase in the stand-alone basis is an example of that.
 The former Showcase sales force is now assigned LoopNet Premium Lister, both on a stand-alone basis and bundled list Showcase or national distribution. 
 At this point, we have approximately 71% of our revenue coming from 1-year subscriptions, while the remaining 29% is primarily made up from marketing services, including LoopNet's premium membership, CoStar Showcase, as well as revenue, advertising across both platforms. As we continue to make progress cross-selling some of the LoopNet subscribers onto 1-year contracts, as Andy talked about, we expect an increase in the amount of marketing revenue to be included in our  subscription revenue metric. 
 For all the Loopsters on the call, the LoopNet Marketplace continues to be the premier website for marketing commercial real estate. The number of LoopNet premium members during the quarter, third quarter of 2012, increased to 80,062, up approximately 6,800 compared to the third quarter of 2011.
 The average revenue per paying subscriber, or ARPU, per subscribers is approximately $65.91 for the third quarter of 2012.
 Unique visitors to each of the LoopNet-owned websites tallied 5.9 million during the third quarter of 2012, according to Google Analytics, up approximately 30% from 4.6 million in the third quarter of 2011. LoopNet registered users, including basic and premium users, totaled 6.4 million as of September 30, up 22% from the third quarter of 2011. 
 I will now provide the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2012. Our forward-looking outlook reflects current expectations as of today, takes into account recent trends, growth rates, renewal rates, which may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate or by the overall economy. Actual results may vary from these results. Call your doctor if you have any issues.
 As discussed last quarter, throughout the LoopNet integration process, we've planned to consider alternatives for certain services from the 2 companies that overlap or create confusion among customers. We may reduce sales efforts in some areas or discontinue certain services within the boundaries established by our consent decree.
 We would undertake these changes only if we believe they are accretive to the business in the long term. But this could lead to some negative impacts in the short term.
 The change to our Showcase marketing services is one service, and we intend to continue to evaluate other services, like LoopNet property comps and property tax. We believe the revenue and earnings guidance we are providing accounts for these possible changes.
 Based on strong earnings results in the third quarter of 2012, we are raising our estimates for non-GAAP net income per diluted share to a range of $1.59 to $1.64 for the year. This increase in guidance range is a $0.16 increase from the previous midpoint, $0.16.
 We are clearly seeing the benefits of integration activities associated with the LoopNet acquisition, trends like the cost reviews, as reflected in our higher non-GAAP net income. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.40 to $0.45.
 The marketing programs accompanying our ongoing cross-selling activities I discussed last quarter are still expected to be -- to have an impact range of $0.10 to $0.12 on our non-GAAP net income per diluted share; however, the timing of these activities has changed slightly. We expect to align these marketing activities with our cross-selling activities from the sales force throughout the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2013.
 The first quarter of 2013 non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be lower than the fourth quarter, as a result of the marketing activities, as well as seasonal higher expenses in this first quarter, which we always see. After the first quarter of 2013, we expect earnings to increase at a healthy pace moving forward. 
 We expect to publish more detailed guidance for 2013 as we discuss our 2012 year-end results, and we expect to continue to grow earnings year-over-year each quarter on our path to 30-plus percent adjusted EBITDA margins by the end of 2014.
 Included in our earnings guidance, as we discussed last quarter, the company expects to launch CoStarGo and CoStar Suite in the U.K. in the fourth quarter, and we expect to incur launch-related costs in the fourth quarter of 2012 and as Andy mentioned, into the first quarter of 2013. While this is expected to impact profitability in our U.K. segment for the next 2 quarters, we expect these new products to accelerate revenue growth in the U.K. and to begin to drive improvement in the U.K. EBITDA margins in 2013.
 In terms of revenue, we are raising the low end of estimates for our range to approximately $347 million to $349 million for the full year. The fourth quarter 2012, we expect $97 million to $99 million in revenue, but we are pleased with the strong sequential revenue growth rates so far this year. We do expect a more moderate growth rate in the fourth quarter, mostly due to the seasonally weaker sales quarter that LoopNet has seen for years and years, coupled with the expected impact of RMS and the Grubb contracts, which we've discussed.
 In summary, I'm very pleased with the third quarter results, which include the first full quarter of LoopNet operations that begin to provide insight into the strong earnings potential of this combined business. With our integration activities already directly contributing to earnings, we are well on our way to delivering the synergies we expected when we announced the deal.
 More importantly, based on our early cross-sell success and realignment of the sales force, we remain confident that revenue opportunities are achievable by integrating these great businesses. We see an enormous opportunity for growth as the industry-leading platform with the most complete and growing set of services for commercial real estate.
 Based on the revenue and earnings results for the quarter, I believe we are well on our way to achieving the medium-term goal we introduced last quarter of $500 million in run rate revenue by the end of 2014, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low to mid-30% range.
 More now than ever, we believe it is an achievable  benchmark that sets us on a realistic path towards our long-term goal of $1 billion in high-margin revenue.
 As always, I look forward to sharing this progress with you in coming quarters. And with that, I'll open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bill Warmington of Raymond James. 
William Warmington: So I wanted to ask first if you could talk to us about where you are relative to the cost synergies for the merger. We've been talking about a $20 million target over a 24-month period. It sounds like you're probably running ahead of that. 
Brian Radecki: Bill, it's Brian. Yes, I think clearly shown in the numbers that we're just barely 6 months into the integration, but I think we're probably ahead of where we thought we would be. And you are seeing that directly in our earnings numbers and us raising earnings guidance along with still being able to invest in the marketing for the cross-sell. So I think we're extremely happy where we are on that metric. And I think we're, again, well on our way to getting there, more than halfway. And I think that we've already held other things in place that we believe will be there on time or sooner. 
William Warmington: Okay. And then I wanted to just ask if -- you were very helpful last time in terms of -- last quarter, in terms of giving some color around the organic growth. I know you gave some figures on the subscription-based portions, specifically. If you look at it for total growth there, I know that you have some adjustments there for the LoopNet revenue in terms of deferred revenue write-offs. How do you look -- how do you manage those pieces in terms of what you calculate for organic growth in the third quarter? And then how does that play out in the fourth quarter? 
Brian Radecki: Yes. I try to give everybody a little bit of clarity on that. I mean, if you were to look at the CoStar business, we're sort of in the 12% to 13% range. If you look at LoopNet, sort of taking out all the adjustments, they're sort of in the 10% to 11% range. So again, I'm sort of giving a range of 11% to 13% for the business. I gave a new metric. People will go back and look at the transcript this time of what the subscription base revenue is, it's now about 71% quarter-over-quarter, and that's growing at 14%. So what does that tell you? It tells you the other 29% is growing at below 14% and sort of the one-off marketing stuff. So obviously, one of the big goals is to, as Andy talked about, is to constantly go out there and sell people annual contracts for those marketing services and moving them over to that bucket. So I would expect to see that 71% grow next year, which, as that grows, you'll see higher growth rates. So I think until then, you're going to sort of be in that 11%, 12%, possibly 13% range, probably a little bit more conservative in there as we combine the 2 companies. 
William Warmington: Okay. Any specific thoughts on the fourth quarter organic? 
Brian Radecki: Sure. Yes. I mean, I think we talked about -- in the fourth quarter, if anyone goes back and looks at LoopNet's numbers, they've always had -- that's always sort of been their worst quarter. So it's always a seasonally weak quarter for them. So I think, obviously, that will moderate sort of our organic revenue growth. And we do have the RMS contract and the Grubb & Ellis, which is still in bankruptcy court that keeps getting extended, but we don't know. So I would actually expect to be in the middle of the revenue range. Now again, there's a lot of factors. We've reversed the trend last quarter. There's a lot of other things that can happen. But I think with their seasonally weak quarter, knowing that these other contracts are definitely coming out in the fourth quarter, I'm expecting sort of a midrange, in the middle of the range of where we're at. And then I expect, obviously, to move back to what we've been seeing prior to that, into the first quarter. 
William Warmington: Got you. And then I wanted to ask, where are you seeing -- it sounds like you're seeing a lot of success with the cross-selling. I just want to know if you can give us some color in terms of particular market sizes, particular geographies, particular firm sizes, type of product, something that where you're having particularly strong success. 
Brian Radecki: Sure. That's a good question. And I would actually say that, at this point, a couple of markets stand out, like the California markets are doing extremely well. In particular, Los Angeles, where both LoopNet and CoStar Group have very large customer bases down there, and some salespeople are having some great success there. But another area would be Chicago, where they've seen a lot of success. But I actually think that the biggest determinant of the kind of numbers we're seeing and where they're coming from is individual sales professionals, skill set and what they've learned and how they approach the upseller conversion sale. So I'm seeing individuals who clearly get it. And our -- I think we've got individuals who've done 20 to 30 upsells on their own. And then we have other individuals who haven't yet figured it out, and we are providing continuing ongoing training support to help them figure out how the sale works. And I guess that's ultimately good news because, eventually, we'll get everyone up to speed, and it should be fairly consistent. But the -- over the short term, in Chicago, where we first started to trial the process and those salespeople did a lot of exposure with the cross-selling. Southern California, where we just have a bunch of good salespeople, and they've got a big pool to work. But over the intermediate term, it will probably be heavily focused in California, Texas and Florida. And a lot of activity everywhere else in the country. And the other thing we've seen is that in the initial rounds, we've done extremely well with the 1- to 5-person shop at LoopNet. So someone with -- just a handful of brokers, a relatively small shop, which has never historically been CoStar's greatest strength and now, this merger has given us that entryway there. And that's doing really well. The 35- or 40-person shop who might have been using LoopNet before, they're facing a very significant cost increase to go from LoopNet to CoStar. So where the 2-person shop may be paying $400, $500 more per month, and they can do that, the larger shop may be facing $10,000-plus more per month. And I think that has a longer sale cycle. So we'll see those start to kick in later in the process. But the typical size of the leads we're looking at, or the LoopNet users are looking at, are 3 to 10 users in the shop. And I'm encouraging the sales force to work that sub-10 list because if we have a lot of success in the sub-10 list, they'll just give us a stronger position in the plus-10 user area over time. Also, the biggest misperception out there in the marketplace, prior to merger, which we're now able to correct, that we merged, we can actually compare databases and show that to people, and people take it face value when you share it with them. The biggest misconception is the relative strength of the CoStar retail progress and the LoopNet retail information service. And a lot of retail-oriented brokers are going, "Wow, customer's got a phenomenal retail database." And so we're getting a lot of little retail shops coming over, which is good news. Now so far, the -- so far, we really, to be honest, have not achieved what our potential's going to be in the selling LoopNet Premium Lister to the CoStar clients. And that's just a function of training. It's just -- we try to do a lot, as you can tell, really quickly. And probably, at our sales -- annual sales conference in January, we'll exert a lot more effort to cross-sell the other way where we'll start selling LoopNet's subscriptions to the CoStar information clients. And I actually think that, that is going to be -- I'm very optimistic about the potential for that because I think it just -- it makes so much sense for these firms to be marketing their listings on LoopNet, and many of them just started taking advantage of it. And I think we'll get dramatically better economics when we start selling the LoopNet Premium Lister to firms, with collections or brokers on annual contracts, rather than one-off monthly contracts to individuals. So all that bottom line, as a way of saying, it looks good. We're moving really fast. I'm very impatient for the future. 
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. 
Brett Huff: One quick follow-up to what you said before, which is very helpful, Andy, sort of the 3% to 5% target, and they were paying it sounds like an incremental $400 or $500. Is that -- I'm assuming that's per month? 
Brian Radecki: That's per month. So the average deal size is -- I mean, you can calculate it, but somewhere in the $500 a month is the average deal size there. 
Brett Huff: And is that -- that's the incremental? Or is that the new bundle that replaces the $60 a month on average or whatever or maybe $100 or $120 a month on average? 
Brian Radecki: Actually -- and I haven't done the math on the numbers I have. So these numbers are moving pretty quickly, like it's ramping up, so they're moving quickly here. But what I've been observing is that the -- when someone was paying LoopNet $80 for some combination of marketing information services, they're typically now paying us about $500 a month for CoStar information services alone, and then they're paying a little bit more in addition to get pure LoopNet marketing services. So we're -- not in every case. But in overall, we're capturing a little more LoopNet revenue, but it's on the marketing side, on annual contracts, and we're getting about $500 average for CoStar information services, again, on annual contracts. 
Brett Huff: Yes, that's helpful. And then of the -- I think, 948 was the new sales. Congratulations on that, by the way. 
Brian Radecki: Thank you. I was trying to pull the number. I didn't get it fast enough. One of the significant things there that you should catch in there is we've gone for about 10 or 15 years with a 50-50 balance between selling to new customers and existing customers. So it's been 50% adding additional services to existing customers -- find new customers. The first time in the last 6 months, we shifted dramatically to the new customer side. So we're picking up -- I heard different numbers in the quarter, but it was moving towards a 70-or-some percent. 
Andrew Florance: Correct. Yes, moving towards 70%. 
Brett Huff: Wow, that's helpful. And then the 948 number, that's net new sales. Is that just new customers or new customer sites? Or is that additional modules to existing customers? 
Brian Radecki: That's new customer sites. 
Brett Huff: Okay. And then of those... 
Brian Radecki: And part of the surprise here, for us, is that the people who are upgrading the fastest in the LoopNet world are the people who weren't paying anything at all. 
Brett Huff: That's interesting. Of the 948, in that 948, are you counting people who were Loop users and who are now buying this $500 CoStar on average? Is that counted in the 948? Or is it -- are Loop customers now existing customers, and so don't count in the 948? 
Brian Radecki: They don't count in the 948. So they've got to be a new customer. 
Andrew Florance: But if they were a premium LoopNet user, it would count. They were just using the LoopNet site. 
Brian Radecki: The question is that, were they paying or not? And I think what Andy was saying before is that the surprising thing is that it's "premium," more heavily weighted towards premium people that actually weren't paying anything. They are using the LoopNet system, but they weren't paying, that were signing up here. 
Andrew Florance: And I think that mix will change. But I think that's, to me, almost -- it's an amazing statistic. 
Brett Huff: And then last question on the 948, can you tell us how many were those kind of upgrades or the premium type deals, premium to paid? 
Brian Radecki: I'm giving you a very -- I looked at it, and I'm giving you sort of a recollection from memory, so I could be wrong. But it was, I believe, somewhere in the 400 to 500 were premium. 
Brett Huff: That's helpful. And then lastly, the $1 billion goal that you all have talked about for a while, could you give us an update on the broad strokes of which segments or products or however it's easiest to divide that up, what percentage of that $1 billion kind of comes from different things? Like for example, I know Loop was a big cog in that wheel in terms of marketing services. But can you -- is there any sort of granularity you can give us on what the split might look like at various product once you get to $1 billion? 
Brian Radecki: It's -- I'm sure a lot of things will evolve, and we'll see the world differently over the next several years. But we often look at it by not so much by specific product, but by industry segment. So if you look at -- in the most simplistic way, if you look at brokerage firms, owners -- and owners are really just institutions. They can be debt, equity, private, public, whatever, and then banks, who are more towards the regulatory side, and it's a little different there, and then other. We believe that the potential in the banking side of the business, remember these banks keep a very large percentage of their commercial real estate on their books. So they're particularly sensitive to it and trying to evaluate, understand and look at credit risk, default and the like. And we were meeting with the CEO of Wells Fargo earlier in the week, and he was talking about how the fact that in the residential world, he's presented with a lot of very hard numbers and quantitative analysis of what's occurring. And historically, in commercial real estate, it feels much more like an art and an opinion. So we think that on the banking inside, there is a $200 million-plus opportunity. And currently, that is probably something in the $20 million to $30 million range for us. So we think that could grow tenfold-plus overtime. And then we also think that we are relatively lightly penetrated in the owners segment. And we see, in some cities, among owners that we think are a certain scale, we might be 17% penetrated plus in the older cities; and then newer cities, we're single digit. So we think that's also another couple of $100 million-plus segment. And then you can just mechanically look at -- one of the things that the LoopNet merger has done is it has clearly, in very vivid color, reinforced for us the size of the brokerage community out there doing deals, making a living in commercial real estate. And we feel like 1/2 of them are using -- LoopNet marketing as a solution, 1/2 are using CoStar information, and you can cross-sell both. And we believe that's several hundred million of potential. So it's -- I sort of look at it as those 3 legs stool. And then I'm sure the other category will be really fascinating. All the bizarre, never expected uses of the information products, from cellular towers to taxi dispatch, to package routing, to power planting, so on and so forth. But I don't see that ever being more than a $50 million, $100 million space, the other category. Except I was thinking the other day that Apple could use some help with their maps. I hope that gives you some help. 
Brian Radecki: And Brett, just to put that in context, I mean, by the first quarter of 2013, we're going to be in $100 million range for a quarter. So it will be in the $400-plus million range. We set out a $500 million target out there by '14. So I think, if you sort of add up -- I mean, Andy is doing this off top of his head, but $200 million here, $100 million there, $200 million there, you sort of quickly get from the $500 million to the $1 billion. So I think that gives people a pretty good road map. I also think in there, you're going to have a couple of hundred million dollars from just marketing across all the platforms. So I think it's a pretty clear path to the $0.5 billion. I think people can see the clear path on the earnings side, too, which is, for me, really exciting, and then I think from there, a run to $1 billion. 
Brett Huff: Okay. And then last question is on how the comp works for the cross-sell, Andy. I know you pay a lot of attention to how your sales force is working and have in the past. What kind of insights can you give us on how you're incenting your folks during these trainings and sort of reprioritizing? What's the -- so what's the key comp driver? 
Andrew Florance: You just made Brian hit the floor laughing. 
Brian Radecki: I was trying to keep it to myself. 
Andrew Florance: So the -- it's probably a little bit of a view into how the sausage is made. It may not be terribly interesting. But the reality is that you've got a couple of sales people here who are putting in some really good numbers on this cross-selling. Once they figure it out, they're doing extremely well. And it's just the traditional sales plan there, and the other sales people are responding to that. But the other key here is that we've initiated this teaming effort, where we're taking more junior accounting execs and more senior accounting execs and building teams, where the juniors are keeping the demo flow going and handling installations, and where seniors are handling presentations and close activity. We have set a number of incentives where -- at different tiers where someone gets their first 120,000 of cross-sell annualized. They get a bonus that might be $10,000, and then there's some bigger prizes. They could escalate up to the $100,000 mark for the teams and individuals that hit these volume goals -- escalating volume goals. And then the one thing we've done last 2 years is we have given a market goal to the sales teams that has a very low 7-digit number to a set of team of 10 or 12 people split up. So you get both team and individual focus on trying to win these prizes, as well as just the traditional commission plan, which is quite adequate. On the flip side, the U.K., we're focusing on the rest of the year very heavily on deployment and usage objectives. And then in 2013, they'll be on the same plan as the U.S. On the LoopNet side, we have made some pretty significant changes and I really, really, again, stress I'm very pleased with the way they've sort of seen the big picture and are working toward this. But we are now -- we used to pay -- we did some calculations. And looking at the lifetime value, as I mentioned, selling premium lister to someone versus selling property comps. These are dramatically different lifetime values for the company, and yet they've often paid very similar commission values. We have dramatically shifted the commission plans to reward the sales teams for selling the premium lister products, which we think have longer staying power and more solid revenue. And we've kept stagnant or soft in the commission on the -- or actually, completely eliminated commission on things like property comps and property facts. So there's a fair amount of movement in all kinds of areas here occurring. 
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Michael Huang at Needham. 
Michael Huang: Just a quick follow-up on the 948 customers you added in the quarter. Was there anything onetime in nature here? And how should that trend kind of going forward absent from the seasonality you might see in Q4? 
Andrew Florance: Well, it's a good question. The beautiful thing about this is -- I'm probably seeing, I don't know, maybe 20 of these sales, I'm not sure. But I've seen a lot of them where I've gone in just different parts of the country and gotten a feel for what we're -- what it's like. And overwhelmingly, in my view, these are absolutely real career commercial real estate players. And when you migrate these players into CoStarGo and they adopt an inventory system with dramatically higher-quality content, research-verified, much more comprehensive, I believe that this is very sticky revenue. And I would expect that it would be in the same 90% renewal area. And so it's not that I have seen no indication that any of this stuff is onetime in nature, and some of the sales that you are seeing are things like Resolve, Virtual Premise in other areas. And that, by its nature, is extremely sticky, where you're doing lease managements and portfolio management with big implementation cost. So this is a continued philosophy of the company to pursue the long-term stable revenue and swear off things like telecom and vendor revenue, which comes and goes with the wind. 
Michael Huang: So would it be unrealistic to kind of see that number trend up kind of through 2013? I mean, so could we see another record in terms of customer adds as we... 
Andrew Florance: I would be disappointed if we didn't. 
Michael Huang: Okay, great. In terms of the U.K., I think you had kind of touched on how gross rates could accelerate on the heels of some new products launched out there through next year. So what actually would be the kind of range of expectation for 2013 in terms of growth rates out of that region? And maybe help us understand kind of what that could look like as you exit next year. 
Andrew Florance: Well, this is -- it's difficult to give you any sort of precise number just because the situation is new, and we would be able to give you a clear view of this after the first couple of months of selling activity. But the simplest terms, the product that's being offered in the United Kingdom is basically -- it's called FOCUS. It is described by the U.K. leadership as deeply unsexy. It is based upon, I believe, cold fusion. It was designed and built in late 1990s, early 2000, and I've been struck by what a piece of garbage it is. And so we're taking -- that's what people are going to be on. That's what people are on right now. And we're basically coming in with the iPad app, which some of our clients describe as they love -- I use the word "love" in that relationship with the CoStarGo. And so we've got book ends of product here. We've got radically different products. And so we're going to go in there, and we're going to look for -- they typically are paying dramatically less per person in the U.K. for our services, this old FOCUS system, than we are able to capture in the United States. And we're not going to try to get the U.S. pricing. If we did, we've would be wildly profitable in the U.K., I mean, like with very good penetration there. But we're trying to get reasonable, not overly aggressive, upgrade prices, and we'll be able to report the end of the first quarter. When we report first quarter numbers, we'll have some really good color on that. But I'm expecting a good result, but we'd see what it looks like with actual experience on the ground. 
Brian Radecki: And just to add just a few things to that. I think that, as Andy said, we're actually going to be focusing on training in the fourth quarter, so we would certainly not expect to see a lot from the U.K. on the sales side in the fourth quarter. Again, as we said, as we start selling in the first quarter, you'll get a better shot of what that looks in the second quarter. But just to give you some rough numbers, the U.K. has traditionally, for the last 2, 3, 4 years has run behind CoStar Group at sort of growth rate percentages. So in 2010 and '11, they were flat or up or down just a tiny bit. In 2012, they're sort of in single digits, where CoStar has grown in double digits. So our goal for 2013 for the U.K. is to get them up to double digits. I mean, one thing we've been doing -- and so it's -- in the U.K., it's looking at the marketing services, which is growing at smaller growth rates at 10% to 11% versus the subscription businesses in the higher percentage rates. It's to look at all the pieces of the business and say, "How do we that? How do we get all the other pieces up to sort of where the big subscription thing is." So that applies to the U.K. So my goal is for the U.K. -- Paul Marples and Matt Green, if you're listening, is double-digit revenue growth, which we haven't seen in years and then, obviously, to continue that moving forward. And it's the same thing, I want to get the marketing piece up. I want to get the land sites and the BizBuySell. I mean there's a bunch of smaller pieces of our business, Virtual Premise, and I want to get them all up to sort of the higher growth rates. So anyways, I hope that gives you a little more color. 
Michael Huang: Awesome. And then just last question for you. I think you had mentioned that you've only distributed kind of 16,000 of those LoopNet leads to your sales team and have only contacted a portion of those. So when would you expect to kind of strip it out that the balance of those leads and kind of contact that broader audience? I mean -- and what does that imply to sales headcount growth through next year? 
Andrew Florance: What you'll see is probably more of a -- about shifting resources from headcount being allocated to -- shifting headcount allocation from approximately have lower value to approximately higher value. So 350 salespeople, still a pretty significant number. We will accelerate the distribution of those leads, particularly to those people who get it and are closing -- converting them sales. We'll accelerate those through the year. But realistically, there's no conceivable way that the sales force can actually get to all these people over the course of the next 3 years. And there will be also -- I mean, you can take your traditional  Geoffrey Moore, Crossing the Chasm kind of adoption curve. You're going to have your innovators early, early adopters, the early whore, that kind of thing. And it's going to be a 3-year process, I think, to sort move through these things at the very best. 
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brandon Dobell of William Blair. 
Brandon Dobell: Brian, on a go forward basis, you guys kind of narrowed down what the kind of consistent metrics are going to be that you're going to give us. It sounds that there's going to be a subscription revenue number. But in terms of users added or user count or things like that, you guys narrowed it down to what we should kind of expect and how we're going to start to build the model. A little more granularity? 
Brian Radecki: Yes. And I think -- again, it's a -- I think we're still evolving that, but I think you guys heard some of the metrics here in this one. And it definitely will be on a subscription basis. It will be on premium members. So we're going to continue to give some metrics as -- some of the other metrics. But as they evolve, we'll evolve more. But I think that's where you look at -- 71% of the business is about the subscription-based services, and we want to move more of it there. So I mean, I want to see that number increase to 75% or 80% over the coming years. So I think those will be the metrics that we'll focus on, but we will still give user metrics and  explain, "Okay, well, here's what's happening in those user metrics," for example. The CoStar numbers and what we're doing with Showcase, we explain that. So I think -- I always tell people, "You have to understand what's happening in the metrics based on the decision we're making. I wouldn't necessarily take the metrics at face value." The other thing, just to point out, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one up at all hours of the night when I saw your note there. But that -- I was pretty clear, I mean, as far as the revenue range, though I actually do think we're going to be in the middle of the revenue range. I know I saw your note that said, "Hey, they should be in the high end because they always beat it." We give a range so that we can be in the range and we definitely -- when you look at LoopNet historically, Q4 has always been very tough for them. We do have something that we know about as far as our RMS and small things. So we actually do believe we'll be in the middle of the range, and so that should be the expectation from people. I just want to throw that one in there because you're on the line. 
Brandon Dobell: Yes. Fair enough. I appreciate that. 
Andrew Florance: Did you make that like it's directed to someone? 
Brandon Dobell: It seems like it but I got to go back and listen to it again. Brian, your comments about the transition from Q4 this year to Q1 of next and then expectation for EPS to increase, I think you said, at a healthy pace going forward. I wanted to make sure I understand the semantics between quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year and that increase at a healthy pace. Should we expect every quarter have a greater EPS number than the first quarter and kind of be at that stair step up? 
Brian Radecki: I haven't given 2013 guidance. But maybe I'll try to be a little more clear on that is that we gave $0.40 to $0.45 in the fourth quarter. If you look at 8 of the 9 or 8 of the 10 for CoStar Group transitions from Q4 to Q1, Q1 is always down and that's because we do the annual sales conferences. That's when everyone gets raises. You all have the high benefits. So that's sort of a given. So if my range is $0.40 to $0.45 in the fourth quarter, people can expect it to be lower by a few pennies in the first quarter in addition to the marketing service that we had. That should still be up, and I expect that to be up year-over-year when you compare it. And I expect each quarter next year to be up year-over-year. And I definitely expect going from Q1 to Q2, as I said, a healthy pace, expect to see growing net income. But the first quarter, if you just take -- if someone just says, "Here's number for the year," and I divide it by 4, you're going to be off in the first quarter because of that seasonality. So I was purposely pointing that out because I noticed models where people sort of just divided the number by 4. I think the annual numbers are -- I think people are sort of getting there. But I think that, that first quarter, I was trying to purposely point that out to people. 
Brandon Dobell: Okay. And then... 
Brian Radecki: It's similar with the revenue on the LoopNet. If people weren't paying attention on SIG [ph], why does Q4 look softer and it's not just -- it's a seasonality thing that's in their business. So I'm just trying to point those out people. 
Brandon Dobell: Okay. And then, I guess, in a similar fashion from a kind of staging perspective, the U.K. business, how far away are you guys from profitability? And was there -- is there a timeframe in which you'd say we're 100% certain we're going to get there? Or is that kind of the range to where it starts to make a difference so we can see in the model? And then, I guess, as the add-on there, can this business be as profitable as the U.S. business? Or is it just a scale issue so it's not going to get there? 
Andrew Florance: So the business -- I remember that we acquired -- it was a pretty small business. We acquired a number of very small businesses. There was a long period where we're migrating multiple software platforms together into one common U.K. platform. And then we embarked upon investing -- and as the business was profitable, we're sharing good margins in the U.K. And then we made the investments to quadruple the research in the U.K. -- quadruple the investment research in the U.K. in order to get up to the same standards of products we produce in the US. And then the next phase was to transition the old, tired software into the much more competitive, consistent international U.S. software platform with CoStarGo. Those were 2 very significant investments, which did not have an immediate return post Lehman Brothers. So now what happens is you launch these new products, you're going to begin to get -- you would expect -- you certainly would expect accelerating revenue. You also get declining expenses now because you have a surge of research that was occurring. You had dozens of additional researchers surging, and that temporary staff surge is coming off. And then you also have dozens of software developers who are allocated in the U.K. that start phasing off. And we would expect to have a very clear picture of the road to profitability. As you move halfway through the year, we can start talking about it. And it would happen -- and if you're familiar with the company over time, often when these things switch from investing mode to margin expansion mode, it surprises everyone how fast it goes. And I would absolutely expect the U.K. to have the same margin potential as the United States. It is a very sophisticated, intensely focused commercial real estate industry over there. And I don't -- and despite the fact that's $2 trillion-some GDP and there's a $14 trillion, $15 trillion GDP, your scale is in your software, and it becomes sort of like a California operation. And so I think it will have -- I still believe it will have good potential in the long run. 
Brian Radecki: And just to throw us some numbers on that trend, and I think that if you sort of look at the 9 months ended with allocations, we're at $6.6 million loss versus $2.8 million. I think once we release the product in the fourth quarter, we get through some of the marketing in the first quarter. I would expect to see the losses 1/2 over the next 4 quarters, which at least gives everybody a little something to model to. And then I think, obviously, based on the revenue growth, we'll be giving people more clarity on what the target date of breakeven. And yes, just like Andy said, I thoroughly believe it can be just as profitable as the U.S. and that's what we expect. I expect nothing less. So I mean, we will definitely put a time period on that. Probably, we'll have more clarity by the end of next year. But I think once we've sort of finished these initial marketing things, I think you'll see the cost get cut in 1/2 the following few quarters, just because product development sort of rolls off of that. And then we'll give you guys clarity on sort of the rest. 
Operator: We'll go next to the line of Todd Lukasik with MorningStar. 
Todd Lukasik: Just following up on the U.K. there. The corporate allocation of $2.3 million in the last quarter, is that literally just corporate overhead? Or does that include the cost of -- you mentioned dozens of developers allocated to the U.K. to transition the technology? 
Brian Radecki: Yes, it is. There's a lot of development allocation in there. And so once that stops at the end of this year, obviously, those loss numbers will be paired back fairly quickly. We do have some marketing that we've talked about that's going to be happening there. But that's why I would definitely expect by the time you get to the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, those numbers will be 1/2 of what you saw this year. And I think improving with revenue growth. 
Andrew Florance: You only have temporarily transferred personnel and increased travel expenses. 
Todd Lukasik: Got you. Okay. And then I just wanted to go back and revisit the numbers you mentioned earlier, Andy, with regards to the cross-sell sales results to date. 100,000 leads, 16,000 distributed. Some of those have received demos, and 723 deals closed for, I think, a monthly contract value of $381,000. Is that $381,000 attributable to all of the 723 closed deals or just the portion of the 723 that had prior monthly commitments with LoopNet? 
Andrew Florance: That's the entire set. 
Todd Lukasik: Okay. All right. And then I was curious about the 100,000. Do you have a breakdown in terms of the number of those leads that are paying LoopNet something now versus sort of the premium category that you guys mentioned? 
Andrew Florance: Sure. We actually have analyzed that list to death. So you start out with a 6 million sum and you filter it down to 100,000 you're focused on. So we developed a whole -- we built and rebuilt that database, added all kinds of fields, doing characteristic usage patterns, the sorts of listings they have, the dollar-valued listings, estimate their commission earnings, all that kind of stuff. We developed scoring systems where -- for consistent, continuous use, plus having listings, plus time periods between accessing the system, all kinds of things, campus scoring system. We scored them from negative -- they ended up getting scores from -- the 6 million from negative 20 to positive 50, positive 50 being the most promising. And we were just focusing on the 100,000 are really the ones that are in the, I can't think exactly, maybe the 6-plus or 5-plus category. And of those, I think it's about 50/50, roughly 50/50, they're paying something or who have paid something over time. And we -- the leads we've been distributing to sales force to date are random. So we have not been -- we have intentionally not distributed the ones we scored 20s, 30s, the higher score onces, because we want them to confront the 5s and 10s and 11s and 12s first and learn what they're doing and then start to go to the higher value ones. 
Todd Lukasik: Okay. So if I understand what -- correctly what you just said, there may be a greater yield opportunity in the leads that you tackle next year or the year after that and the year after that? 
Andrew Florance: Yes. And that's a combination of just continued to put more higher -- more of these higher scored leads, plus the salespeople figuring out how to do it. 
Todd Lukasik: Okay. And then -- so the $381,000 that you have on the monthly contracts, I think the incremental annual revenue opportunity there is somewhere around $4.1 million, if I did the math correctly. Is it fair to assume that there's about $1 million in LoopNet cross-sale revenue synergies baked into the fourth quarter revenue guidance? 
Brian Radecki: You're sort of plucking that out of the air. Obviously, all of the sales numbers -- I mean, as Andy said, a lot of the core people were spent sort of training and cross-training and putting people on teams. So by the time they sold -- and I would say it was in the back half of the quarter so, of course, you'd only get the back half of the quarter revenue on that. So that number, maybe it seems a little bit high to me, but you're sort of plucking that one out of thin air. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: So G&A was a little bit lower than I had expected and probably included a portion of the $2 million of integration costs. So I was just wondering, if we look at $18 million, plus or minus, per quarter, excluding seasonality, is that sort of a sustainable run rate for G&A? Or was there a reason that this quarter was lower? 
Andrew Florance: No. I think it's sustainable. And obviously, the goal is to continue to get more synergies and to obviously improve upon that. I do have the general counsel sitting next to me. So with the caveat, as long as there's no lawsuits coming in the future, but -- because that's where all the legal costs would go. But yes, I think -- he's laughing at my comment. But yes, I mean, I think, obviously, synergies, we're definitely -- somebody asked -- I think Bill started out with that question. We're doing much better on synergies than we anticipated. We're moving much faster on things. So obviously, we're seeing positive results that we think will continue, again, unless something else comes up that we're not aware of. 
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And you mentioned that some of the marketing that you plan to do on cross-selling will be pushed into the first quarter of '13 instead of doing it all in the fourth quarter. And I just wanted to find out what -- like what was the decision-making behind the delay. 
Andrew Florance: A number of different factors. We have done several ways on -- like one of the things we're trying to do upfront is we're trying to differentiate or begin to reeducate the industry on what the key attributes of the brands are. So we're trying to reidentify LoopNet with marketing and CoStar with information. We did a series on marketing pieces. We've done several marketing pieces on the LoopNet side, some good pieces. But we just decided that the pace at which we could do all these changes to the sales force, we wanted to time some of the marketing programs closer to when they would actually be able to go out and meet with people and demo with people. So we -- the information branding pieces are being staged to go out just before the salespeople contact them to try to do the upsell rather than all at once in the fourth quarter. Also, we shifted a major marketing event from 2012 to early 2013, just because of -- schedules weren't working out. We wanted to make it a little more efficient. So it's nothing -- it's more a shift to several months. 
Brian Radecki: And again, Toni, I think what is was is aligning it. Exactly what Andy said, it's aligning with the sales activity. So we talked earlier about we have 350 salespeople, and Andy talked about moving over 100 of them to doing new things that they hadn't done before, teaming people up and training them. So I think the idea is, obviously, to have the marketing pieces going out and making sure that the salespeople are in place to capitalize on those activities versus just setting a bunch of marketing it out. But you're still then reorganizing sales forces and teaming people up. So it's just -- I think it's aligning the 2. And obviously, we think we'll see a much higher IRR and return on those investments by having the 2 aligned. 
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And just lastly, on that point of the sales reps shifting, how long do you think it takes for a full ramp-up? Obviously, they're in training now. But in order for people to get to sort of the full run rate capacity, how long does that normally take? 
Andrew Florance: Yes. The vast majority of the people we're talking about here are already experienced commercial real estate information and marketing services salespeople. So it's more a question of them picking up new roles. And I would say that's probably a 3- to 6-month time period to really get where they're really up to speed and optimized. 
Operator: And we have a follow-up from the line of Brett Huff at Stephens. 
Brett Huff: Hey, guys, just one thing. I missed this earlier in the call. What was the average new rev per customer site, that number you guys usually give? 
Brian Radecki: 8,314. 
Operator: And a follow-up from Bill Warmington at Raymond James. 
William Warmington: A chance to bookend the call here. 
Andrew Florance: You guys are competing. He just thought he had you, too. 
William Warmington: A quick question on the -- I just wanted to make sure I follow the math on the initial cost that the uplift you got this quarter, third quarter, from the -- for the cross-sales. 
Andrew Florance: I don't think there was math. I think Todd asked the question if we thought there was $1 million in there, and I don't think we actually know the exact number. But as we talked about either the majority of the quarter was reorganizing the sales force and cross-training them. So I think a lot of the sales came in towards the back half of the quarter, which would mean only a small portion of revenue when they came in then, too. 
William Warmington: Got you. But the annualized revenue for the 948? 
Andrew Florance: The annualized revenue for the 948. Yes, it looks -- $7 million or $8 million, somewhere in that range. 
William Warmington: So you can figure, probably a couple of million next quarter from that group. 
Andrew Florance: Correct. Correct. 
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. 
Andrew Florance: Thank you. And with that, we will conclude this call, and thank you for joining us. And we look forward to hosting you on the next earnings call, which, I believe, is our CoStar Group's 50th earning call. So we look forward to talking to you then. 
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, running through November 25 at midnight. You may access the AT&T teleconference replay system at anytime by dialing 1 (800) 475-6701 and entering the access code of 266046.

A replay of the call will also be available on our website soon after the call concludes.
 I will now turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? 
Andrew Florance: Good morning, everybody, and thank you very much, for joining us today for this earnings call. As you might expect, this has been a very busy quarter for us. As you know, we've closed LoopNet transaction on April 30. Today, just a few months into integration, we know dramatically more about the potential of the 2 businesses in combination. What we have learned has not changed our investment thesis. In fact, it has strengthened our belief in it and our excitement about the scale of our potential upside here.
 I'm very happy the way our 2 organizations are approaching the integration process. Both LoopNet and CoStar Group have a very talented team of great professionals. Everyday, I've seen enthusiasm, open communication, hard work and commitment to strengthening our position as the #1 service provider to the commercial real estate industry. Our greatest strength in this combination is the expertise, professionalism and commitment of our 1,900-person-strong team.
 The core investment thesis behind the CoStar Group-LoopNet merger is that CoStar Group is a great information service and that LoopNet, a great marketing service. In combination, each service could be effectively cross sold to one another's huge client basis. The combined company is the clear #1 player in marketing commercial real estate on the Internet as well as the #1 go-to source of information for the commercial real estate industry. With common customer profiles and content, we believe the combined companies will enjoy significant cost synergies.
 I would like to begin today's call by telling you what we have learned so far. I will tell you how we expect to pursue the opportunity to upsell our LoopNet members, who are using LoopNet for information to CoStar's information products, while retaining them as LoopNet marketing customers. I will also tell you how we will encourage firms that have listings in CoStar to actively advertise them in the LoopNet marketplace.
 As you may know, LoopNet has over 100,000 unique paying members now, and over 6 million registered members. In our effort to find the best prospects in this universe to upsell CoStar information products to, we look at several factors. These factors include: Does the client already subscribed to CoStar? Are they marketing more than one listing on LoopNet? Have they been searching LoopNet repeatedly over both the past month and the prior 6 months and perhaps before? Are they subscribing to one of LoopNet's information products? Good prospects may include individuals who do not pay LoopNet to subscribe to a product but nonetheless, they're searching the LoopNet website for free.
 Right now, we have identified a group of about 130,000 LoopNet users who we believe are good prospects for CoStar Property, Tenant, or COMPS. I believe that 130,000 prospects is more than -- or I'm sorry, I realized the 130,000 prospects is more than the 100,000 paying subscribers at LoopNet, but we have identified many individuals that are using the free search feature of LoopNet as an information source.
 Overall, this is obviously the largest pool of prospects we've ever had the opportunity to sell to in any acquisition we have ever done in the past. The number is staggering to me and quite motivating.
 The number of potential sites, clients, or users could differ slightly from the 130,000. In a handful of cases, we might find 3 of these leads working together in 1 company, so if they began subscribing to CoStar, they will become 1 client with 3 users. In some cases, we could find a few LoopNet leads from 1 company to a site, where there are actually might be dozens of potential CoStar users there.
 Now that we have merged with LoopNet, we have accessed the data in their systems. This is important because we know the names and contact information of these prospects, as well as their search histories. This means we can approach them with a very targeted sales presentation that's relevant to them and educate them on the benefits they can receive from CoStar information products, and show them clearly how the same search done in CoStar provide more information and more depth of data. We can show these prospects the difference between complete and detailed information from CoStar versus a little less so from LoopNet, when you're using it as an information product.
 In order to learn more about these prospects, we selected and tested one representative market, Chicago. It's a diverse market and allowed us to get a good sample of industry professionals who know LoopNet. Our goal was to understand the scope of the opportunity, the profile of these prospects as well as their priorities, beliefs, needs and attitudes.
 Ultimately, we wanted them to -- ultimately, we wanted to understand the best way to market and sell CoStar information services to them. We retained a third-party market -- I'm sorry, we retained a third-party market research firm to survey hundreds of Chicago-based LoopNet users and what we learned was quite interesting.
 These prospects were foremost in retail real estate followed by apartments, office, industrial and then land. They come from both large and small shops, but most typically, they work in 3- to 10-person shops. The majority of them are full-time commercial real estate brokers, followed by investors and appraisers.
 What we learned is that these prospects are not dissimilar from the profile of clients we currently have. 86% of these LoopNet users said the information they access from commercial estate websites like LoopNet is critical to their success. 97% LoopNet users said that it's important that the website they use has the most accurate data on properties in their market. Not one respondent said that the accuracy of data was unimportant. The overwhelming majority said that it was important that the site they use have a complete list of properties for lease or sale in their market. The bottom line is clear, I believe, access to quality and complete commercial real estate information is critical to their success and they know its importance.
 According to the survey results, half the respondents stated that paying the lowest price possible for access to a commercial real estate website was not an important factor. They value the quality of information over the price they paid for it. One of the respondents summed up the opportunity perfectly by saying, "As a commercial real estate consultant, it's necessary to have the most information available. Our top priority is to provide quality consultation to our clients. The fees are an afterthought."
 So they're looking for the highest quality information and price is not the most important factor. So my clear takeaway is that half the LoopNet users are using LoopNet is an information source because they believe it to be the highest quality source available, or at least roughly as good as other sources out there but at a slightly lower price. I believe that in many cases, they believe that CoStar might be the best source for certain areas whether they're in commercial real estate market but in the area that they work and they believe that LoopNet has higher quality information.
 Only 20% of LoopNet users surveyed believe that LoopNet has less listings for Chicago than CoStar does. For those where retail real estate is their primary practice area, only 11% believe that LoopNet is -- doesn't have as much information as CoStar, or more. Not one of the principally land-focused LoopNet users thought LoopNet had less listings than CoStar.
 In other words, the majority of LoopNet users surveyed believe that LoopNet is a more comprehensive, or at least as comprehensive, information source as CoStar. For most LoopNet users, we believe the misperception that LoopNet has more information than CoStar is an important decision for them to start subscribing to use LoopNet as an information source rather than CoStar. Are these LoopNet users correct? Does LoopNet have a more comprehensive database of listings for Chicago than CoStar does? Before LoopNet and CoStar merged, that was very difficult for anyone to answer with any real certainty. Now, 3 months post merger, our respective teams have jumped right in and connected and cross-references the databases and we can clearly demonstrate the differences in the databases.
 CoStar has the most listings by far. As of today, our research team has successfully completed a massive effort to comb through the LoopNet database and find any commercial estate listings that were in LoopNet's database but not in CoStar's database. The connections made as a result of cross-referencing the databases have allowed our researchers to strengthen the relative information advantage that CoStar has. They examined more than 225,000 LoopNet listings that our systems teams could not automatically match to our database, and in the process they found and added 50,000 new listings to the CoStar database.
 In addition to adding just listings, they've also found thousands of new people with listings to initiate regular contact with. So let me clarify the facts and how the 2 databases compare. Remember, that LoopNet's primarily a marketing system and predominantly relies on user input for all their listing content. CoStar, in sharp contrast, has a staff of just about 1,000 engaged in proactively collecting commercial real estate information.
 So not surprisingly, but contrary to what most LoopNet users believe, our CoStar database has roughly twice as many commercial real estate listings in the U.S. as our LoopNet database does. Beyond that, CoStar has dramatically more depth of data on these properties and listings. In every one of the 200 largest U.S. cities, CoStar's database has significantly more properties than LoopNet's database does.
 Remember that only 20% of the surveyed Chicago LoopNet users thought that CoStar had more listings than LoopNet in Chicago. The majority of LoopNet users surveyed think that LoopNet has more listings in Chicago, or the same as CoStar does. And it's now clear that majority is absolutely completely wrong.
 CoStar has 34,730 listings in the Chicago CBSA and LoopNet has 17,848. That means that someone using LoopNet has an information source that's missing nearly 17,000 listings, or roughly half of all listings. Obviously, that's unacceptable for someone making a living showing clients all the possible listings for their requirements.
 Many LoopNet users surveyed, or interviewed in great depth in various focus groups we conducted, really believed that LoopNet had many more retail listings, for-sale listings, small-building listings or land listings. That may or may not have been true in the past but certainly not now. CoStar has 218% more for-sale listings, 206% more retail listings, almost 300% more listings in buildings smaller than 15,000 square feet and 273% more land listings than our LoopNet database for Chicago offers.
 Most importantly, every valid listing in LoopNet will be in CoStar. For years, we've heard from many clients and prospects and focus groups in meetings that they would really love to have a one-stop shop for a complete listing data that combine the listings in LoopNet and CoStar into one place. Now, we can credibly offer them exactly what they want and need.
 Most importantly, at the end of our survey, we also told the Chicago LoopNet users that CoStar has twice as many listings than our LoopNet service does and we asked them, knowing the information, how likely would they now be to subscribe to CoStar for their commercial real estate needs.
 56% stated that they would now be very likely, or likely, to subscribe to CoStar. 29% stated they were unsure, so that they would need some selling to subscribe to CoStar's information service. Only 15% stated they would be unlikely to subscribe.
 We believe that our survey suggests that the 130,000 LoopNet prospects in theory, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 70,000 would be likely to subscribe to CoStar for their information needs if they really came to believe that CoStar contained twice as much information on their market than the LoopNet service they've been using for information. We are focusing our immediate efforts across the U.S. on them.
 Time and again, in focus groups, we have learned it is hard to change long-held beliefs about the relative quality of these databases, especially if accepting a different view might imply that the broker have provided incomplete information to their clients over an extended period of time. Now that the 2 companies have merged, we believe it will now be dramatically easier to change their minds and get them to accept and internalize a belief that CoStar provides a dramatically more complete picture of the market.
 Last month, we took what we learned from linking our listing and client databases, our surveys and focus groups and we set 24 demos in Chicago over a 2-day period with LoopNet users who have used LoopNet as an information service and did not subscribe to CoStar.
 Our goal was to see how effectively we could sell CoStar information services to these LoopNet prospects. In the demo, we confirmed for them that LoopNet is the most heavily-trafficked website for commercial real estate, and that it was a critical resource for them in marketing their properties to large Internet audience of tenants and investors. LoopNet users viewed millions of detailed profile views in Chicago over the prior year, and that could generate leads for their listings.
 We then explained to them that all the listings on the LoopNet service would be in CoStar and that there were nearly 17,000 additional listings in CoStar added by our research department that they could not find in LoopNet. We went through comprehensive comparisons between the 2 databases looking at retail office, land for sale, for lease, so on and so forth.
 I did 4 of those demos and on 2 of my demos, we were able to get a contract right there and then. Another demo we did was to a large brokerage firm, about 30-some brokers, and while it did not close on the spot, which I would not expect to happen with a large brokerage firm, I believe it will close within a month or so.
 One of the sales I was involved with was to a 2-person brokerage shop that have been paying LoopNet $159 per month on a month-to-month basis. They entered into an annual contract for CoStar information and LoopNet marketing with us for $730, a month, a 359% monthly increase. They increased their contract commitment from $159, to $8,760.
 The second 2-man shop I was involved with, signing up that day, increased their monthly payment by 900%. The large 30-broker firm I mentioned is paying LoopNet $187 a month on a month-to-month basis and our proposal would be in the $8,000 to $10,000 a month range on an annual contract.
 Of the 24 demos we conducted on these 2 days, 13 have already signed annual contracts and the majority of cases, it was for both LoopNet for marketing and CoStar for information. So we were gaining CoStar revenue and not losing LoopNet revenue. So in total, 54% of our demos resulted in a signed contract within 2 weeks of the original demo. That far exceeds any close ratio, or time to close, we normally experience.
 We believe that eventually, approximately 80% of those 24 demos could close. What's interesting to me is when I compare that to that survey question of, if you were to learn that CoStar has twice as many listings, would you be likely need some time -- likely to subscribe to CoStar or need some time to think about it or not? Our results here actually matched that survey, which is really quite promising consider that implies across the whole country.
 In total, we've converted 15 LoopNet users in Chicago this month, taking them from an approximate aggregate LoopNet fee of $1,425 a month on a month-to-month basis, to $8,873 a month with combined LoopNet and CoStar purchases on an annual commitment. We increased our monthly yield on these accounts by 500%, and we increased our contract value by 7,000%.
 Interesting to note and important, 6 of the 15 converted LoopNet users were not paying LoopNet anything at all prior to conversion, they were free basic users searching heavily but not paying for premium service.
 Within a week of our successful Chicago experiment demos, we brought 200 LoopNet and CoStar sales people together in Dallas for a sales conference and training session, so that we can begin to scale our Chicago trial to a nationwide cross-selling effort within the next month or so.
 In addition to signing LoopNet users CoStar information products, we will also be approaching firms to encourage them to advertise their properties in loopnet.com. As we mentioned, LoopNet's the most heavily trafficked website in commercial real estate. Yet surprisingly, only about 17% of the listers in the United States for commercial real estate pay for listings on loopnet.com, leaving 83% as the potential target market. There are about 500,000 listings that CoStar was aware of that were not in LoopNet that opened up a whole new prospect universe for LoopNet to sell advertising to. LoopNet built a great brand and a successful product by selling advertising contracts on a monthly basis, one broker at a time.
 It's effective, but it results in much higher churn rates. We can believe that we can grow LoopNet even larger by selling premium lister, at the firm level, on annual contracts rather than just in individual-basis subscription. So we think that those annual contracts will decrease customer turnover. We are very bullish on the revenue potential across signing LoopNet and CoStar products so we intend to increase our investment in marketing for the second half of this year.
 I'm very proud of both the LoopNet team and the CoStar team, as their hard work continues to move us rapidly towards realizing the full potential of this merger. Post merger, we have restructured the LoopNet senior management team to best realize the potential of the merger. LoopNet executives, Fred Saint, Mike Handelsman, Bryan Smith and Wayne Warthen have all been key contributors with LoopNet for many years and have taken charge of several key areas of the company as follows: Fred Saint as President of the LoopNet Marketplace, responsible for the company's product, marketing and business development. As we already know, with approximately 3.6 million unique visitors a month, loopnet.com is a powerful force in commercial estate marketing. Working closely with me, Fred oversees product roadmap and product development at the LoopNet Marketplace.
 Fred joined LoopNet in 2007 with the acquisition of cityfeet.com which he founded in 1999 and successfully led from startup to profitability and its eventual acquisition by LoopNet. 
 Mike Handelsman is President of LoopNet Marketplace Verticals, and is responsible for the Business For Sale and Land sectors, including BizBuySell, bizquest.com, Lands of America and Land and Farm. He's also responsible for our CRM system RE [ph] applications. Mike joined LoopNet as General Manager of bizbuysell.com in 2006, he is responsible for growing each of these verticals. 
 Bryan Smith is President of LoopNet Sales & Customer Service, and is responsible for overseeing and managing LoopNet's significant sales and service teams. He's responsible for overall sales and service strategies, as well as leading the advertising sales business. He's working closely with myself and John Stanfill who, as you know, is the Head of Sales and Customer Service for CoStar. Bryan joined up the LoopNet team in 2003. 
 Wayne Warthen is LoopNet's Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of Information Technology. Wayne joined LoopNet in 1999 and directs LoopNet's data center and network operations, and oversees design and development of the company's web and software applications. Wayne is working closely with our team, Frank Simuro, our Chief Information Officer.
 All 4 of these executives are doing a fantastic job and it's a great honor and pleasure to work with them.
 In addition to LoopNet, I'd like to update you on other important company initiatives. While we've been doing the LoopNet merger and integration, we've made tremendous progress towards our goal of converting our U.K. operations and clients from an antiquated U.K. technology base into our much more powerful and efficient and attractive U.S. product and technology platforms. As of last month, our entire United Kingdom database, which contains 20 years of information, has been migrated from the U.K. input system to our U.S. technology platform.
 And at this point, the U.S. technology platform is backfeeding the content into the legacy U.K. information products. We've also converted their fulfillment and CRM systems to our U.S. technology platform. Now all U.K. researchers are inputting and updating data using our U.S. enterprise platform.
 Before the London Olympic closing ceremonies are done, we expect to have CoStarGo U.K. up and running. We anticipate the rest of the CoStar U.K. product suite will be complete by early fall. This is a culmination of 12 months of intense and excellent effort by 40 of our best software people in the U.S. and in U.K. and our 110 researchers in Glasgow. We'll do a CoStarGo rollout in the fall in the U.K.
 From a sales perspective, the U.K. business reported nearly $1 million in annualized sales for the first 6 months of the year. We believe that we can upsell U.K. clients this enhanced technology platform and achieve significant acceleration of revenue growth in the U.K. in the latter half of this year, next year and beyond.
 Back in the U.S., we have a couple of noteworthy initiatives. Our recent acquisition, Virtual Premise, is expected to release 2 significant product enhancements this fall. First, we expect to bring Virtual Premise's tenant retail and real estate management software platform to mobile and tablet devices, increasing the visibility of portfolio and lease information for its retailer bank and corporate real estate customers.
 Second, we expect to deliver the first phase of integration of CoStar data into Virtual Premise. We've gotten a very positive reaction to that from our clients there. It will enable customers to see relevant CoStar data side-by-side with their own portfolio data. This is only the beginning of putting more information, decision-making power in the hands of the Virtual Premise customer base and exactly what we intended to do when we purchased Virtual Premise last fall.
 In the fourth quarter 2012, PPR expects to launch a multifamily data and analytics service based on research developed with CoStar's research team. We believe that we have now surveyed the more apartment communities than anyone else in the business, and that we have the largest and most comprehensive database for the apartment industry. Demographic analytics such as population income combined with unit-level asking in effective rents and vacancies will provide unparalleled source bar [ph] for such things as lender underwriting, apartment rent setting, redevelopment and ground-up feasibility studies.
 We also expect to launch CompassFLEX, which is a customizable analytic tool. It enables users to find custom credit scenarios from a selection of economic forecasts, confidence levels and mortgage risk parameters to model loan level defaults losses and related recoveries, as well as interest shortfalls that may impact cash flows to certain bonds within CMBS deals.
 FLEX gives users more control to evaluate bonds across multiple scenarios and it provides a more accurate projection of the timing of cash flows which is essential for appropriately evaluating the risk return proposition of both safer premium bonds and the riskier discounted bonds in CMBS.
 In the second quarter 2012, Resolve released a new dashboard for REQUEST. With the industry's heightened focus on data visualization, Resolve's new dashboard has more attractive graphics, more end user capabilities and improved drill-down to underlying detailed capabilities.
 Let's touch on commercial real estate conditions briefly, which right now are looking fine for CoStar and actually -- are actually pretty solid.
 The office market improved in the second quarter of 2012 with vacancy down 20 basis points to 12.6%. Net absorption of 18 million square feet for the quarter was double the 9 million square feet in the prior quarter.
 The 62-million-square-feet absorption for the year were running fairly close to long-term averages. We expect demand to remain positive at 10 million square feet to 25 million square feet of net absorption per quarter, and to show more growth as fears about the current economy recover diminish over the next few years. The steady demand is very good for brokers.
 Although office rents have been flat in many markets for the first time since the recession, we're seeing a small, just under 1-point, rise in asking rents year-to-date, with technology market showing the highest rent growth. At San Francisco, rents are up roughly 16% in the past year.
 The office sector has significant upside in rents relative to most other property types, which in part represents past distress and a low level of rent versus replacement cost rents. Office sales have also returned to normal levels, and as of the second quarter of 2012, sales were on pace to match 2011. Annual office sales volume reached $75 million -- billion, b, with a billion, for 2011 which is near the $80 billion, 10-year average. Improved financing conditions have allowed for the return at large building in portfolio sales for the first time since late 2007.
 So in conclusion with second quarter revenue increasing 37% year-over-year to $85.2 million, 96,096 paying CoStar subscribers with a 94% renewal rate and 100,507 paying LoopNet subscribers, I believe it's clear that our business is healthy, growing and has great prospects.
 As we continue with the integration of LoopNet throughout the second half of 2012, we are more than excited about our prospects in 2013 and beyond. We believe that our employees, clients and shareholders will benefit from our larger, stronger combined company as we continue to expand. 
 Before I turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brian Radecki, I would like to congratulate said Brian Radecki, for becoming -- being named as Chief Financial Officer of the Year, large company category. He was honored to be the CFO of the Year, I was honored that it was in a large company category. And you'll be glad to hear that Mr. Radecki still remains humble and focused on his work. In fact, he's working out here in Glendora this summer and he has selected a modest office space here. As I looked around for Mr. Radecki yesterday, I found him in his office, which is labeled Accounting Storage 2. And the office manager was really quite dismayed that the CFO of the company wanted to work in an interior storage room, she insisted on removing the cabinets. But I just thought if he had an ego, he'd be in Accounting Storage Room 1, not in Accounting Storage Room 2. So with that, I'll now turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brian Radecki. 
Brian Radecki: Thank you, Andy, and appreciate the kudos, which I think I've said before, it's really a team effort, the entire team at CoStar, so I accept the honor on behalf of the entire team.
 As Andy mentioned, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter of 2012, we closed LoopNet acquisition at the end of April. It had included 2 months of LoopNet's financial results as well as some significant acquisition and integration related cost in the second quarter of the consolidated financial statements.
 Today, I'm going to primarily focus on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, on our outlook for Q3 and the remainder of the year and a peak into how we think the next few years will develop.
 Now to review CoStar Group's results for the second quarter of 2012 beginning with revenue. The company reported $85.2 million of second quarter 2012 revenue, an increase of $23.1 million, or 37.2% compared to revenue of $62.1 million in the second quarter of 2011.
 CoStar's organic growth rate continue to steadily accelerate in the first half of 2012 compared with the organic growth rates we witnessed throughout the 4 quarters of 2011, which were in the range of 8% to 12%.
 CoStar's revenues increased 13.8% from the second quarter of 2011, continued by strong sales performance and a small one-time revenue item in the quarter.
 LoopNet annual revenue on a pro forma basis, before any adjustments, grew 10.7% year-over-year for the second quarter of 2012, which is relatively consistent with their 2011 reported annual growth rate.
 Therefore, the combined business is currently growing in the approximate 11% to 13% range in a pro forma basis, before any accounting adjustments. We believe that we can continue to accelerate revenue growth rates with the cross-selling and synergy opportunity Andy discussed.
 We reported a net loss of $6.7 million, or a negative $0.25 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2012 based on 26.5 million shares. These results reflect $9.5 million of acquisition and integration-related expenses incurred in the second quarter as well as an unusually high tax provision of $5.6 million, driven by the costs related to the LoopNet acquisition that reduced GAAP earnings but are nondeductible for tax purposes.
 I highlighted this expected high tax provision last quarter and also alluded to our favorable tax position on a cash basis. Specifically, as a result of the lost carrybacks, we received a tax refund of approximately $9 million during the second quarter and we expect to receive another refund of approximately $3.5 million in the back half of the year.
 Additionally, we expect to receive further tax benefits which we estimate will result in approximately $16 million in cash tax savings at the back half of 2012 and the first half of 2013. Pretty nice. 
 Non-GAAP net income increased $3.2 million or 43% year-over-year to $10.5 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 from non-GAAP net income of $7.3 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2011.
 Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2012 was $20.4 million, an increase of $6.1 million, or 42% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $14.3 million for the second quarter of 2011.
 Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, to the GAAP basis results are shown in detail, along with definitions for those terms in our press release issued yesterday, and will be available on our website at www.costar.com.
 The company had $129 million in cash and investments and $173 million in debt as of June 30, 2012. This represents a modest level of leverage given the strong cash flow generation of our business.
 At this point, I'm going to give some operating metrics for CoStar and the LoopNet businesses, which demonstrates that both businesses performed very well in the second quarter.
 As we integrate the businesses, we do not expect to continue to give all these separate metrics and may introduce some new combined metrics. Net new sales from existing CoStar businesses, totaled $8.2 million, an increased of 16% year-over-year, sold by approximately 209 sales reps.
 The acquisition of LoopNet adds 117 sales reps to our existing sales force for a total sales headcount of 326. This combined sales force has begun to focus their combined energy on the exciting cross-selling opportunities we see in the front of us, and Andy discussed earlier.
 Our existing CoStar customers continued to renew at very high rates during the second quarter of 2012. The 12-month trailing renewal rate for CoStar subscription business increased to $93.7 million, which matched our all-time high for this important metric, which was back in Q1 and Q2 of 2006. This is a 1.5% improvement over the 92.2% from 1 year ago. The renewal rate for subscribers who have been with us for 5 years or longer was a remarkable 99%. 
Andrew Florance: Seriously? 
Brian Radecki: Seriously, all-time high. I wasn't sure it was possible. I had the Yinger Group check it 5 times.
 The in-quarter renewal rate was 94.3%, just above last quarter's 94%, up from 93.2% in the second quarter. As discussed in prior quarters, one of our large customers, Grubb & Ellis, now Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2012. We expect that contract will be renegotiated. However, if the contract is eventually terminated, it would have a significant impact on our short-term renewal rates, reducing the in-quarter renewal rate by up to approximately 5 percentage points. And the annualized renewal rate by 1 to 2 percentage points. We believe our revenue guidance for this year adequately accounts for the uncertainty related to this customer.
 Additionally, we received a termination notice from RMS, a DMGI-owned company, that has a data license with CoStar. In connection with the closing of the LoopNet merger, and as mandated by our consent order with the FTC, LoopNet sold its interest in Xceligent to DMGI and has now become one of our primary competitors. The termination is expected to have a one-time impact in our in-quarter renewal rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately 1%.
 At the end of the second quarter 2012, the existing CoStar business had 96,096 paying subscribers while the LoopNet business had 100,507 paying subscribers, so one or more of LoopNet's commercial real estate_ related services. Both subscriber numbers increased compared to the first quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2011.
 In the quarter, CoStar products featured 1.5 million listings while the LoopNet commercial real estate marketplace included 823,000 active listings. As Andy discussed earlier, we're making great progress in aligning the CoStar and LoopNet databases in an effort to ensure our information services provides customers visibility with respect to all available listings and to enhance the value we provide our customers.
 For all the Loopsters on the call, a few Loop numbers. LoopNet premium numbers increased to 77,279 compared to 75,829 in the first quarter of 2012, and average revenue per premier member, ARPU, increased to 66.04 compared to 65.59 last quarter.
 Profile views in the LoopNet marketplace totaled 107 million for the second quarter of 2012 and LoopNet registered members, including both basic and premium users, totaled 6.1 million as of June 30, 2012.
 Total unique visitors to LoopNet-owned websites tallied nearly 5.6 million according to Google Analytics.
 Essentially, our early insight into the LoopNet marketplace gives us confidence that we can drive significant additional value by introducing long-term CoStar customers to the marketplace, increasing sales at the firm level and focusing on long-term subscription agreements.
 I will now cover results from our income statement for the second quarter and also provide our outlook for the third quarter and full year.
 Gross margins were $57.1 million in the second quarter of 2012, up compared to $39.7 million in Q2 of '11. Gross margin percentage was $66.9 million,  a 3 percentage point year-over-year increase over the second quarter of 2011. We expect to see gross margins expand further for the remainder of the year.
 Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2012 was $57.1 million, an increase of $21.3 million compared to the $35.8 million in the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to 2 months of LoopNet expenses in the quarter. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we recorded $9.5 million in acquisition- and integration-related costs. Most of these costs will impact G&A expenses, but some of the other lines were impacted as well.
 Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2012. Following outlook reflects the current expectations as of today, takes into account recent trends, revenue growth rates, renewal rates, which may be impacted by economic conditions in commercial real estate or the overall global economy. Actual results may vary for these estimates. Is that good, Jon? Got it? Okay.
 As we continue the LoopNet integration process, we will consider alternatives for certain services from the 2 companies that overlap or create confusion among customers. We may reduce new sales efforts in some areas, or discontinue certain services within the boundaries established in our consent decree with the FTC.
 We would undertake such changes only if we believe they are accretive to the business in the long term but this could lead to negative short-term impacts in revenue or earnings. We believe the revenue and earnings guidance we are providing account for these possible changes.
 Based on the continued strong trends in sale and revenues, we are increasing the low end of our 2012 revenue guidance range to a range of $345 million to $349 million. Remember, we just put that out 2.5 months ago, we're increasing the bottom.
 For the third quarter 2012, we expect approximately $94.5 million to $96 million in revenue. While we are pleased with the strong sequential revenue growth rate so far this year, we do expect a more moderate rate in the fourth quarter, mostly due to the seasonally weaker Q4 for LoopNet, and in part due to termination notice I mentioned earlier.
 Consistent with strong revenue trends, we're also raising the low end of our 2012 estimates for non-GAAP net income per diluted share to a range of $1.40 to $1.52 per share based on 26.9 million fully diluted shares, which includes the additional marketing spend in the second half of the year.
 For the third quarter, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.38  to $0.42. As Andy discussed earlier, we plan on launching a substantial cross-selling initiatives that we believe will drive considerable long-term growth benefits for both CoStar information services and the LoopNet marketplace, although the exact timing of these marketing initiatives may vary. 
 We are planning to reinvest the benefits of our strong year-to-date performance in the form of those significant marketing initiatives in the third and fourth quarters to support these critical sales initiatives. We estimate the impacts of these initiatives on our non-GAAP earnings to be a couple of pennies in the third quarter and again, total $0.10 to $0.12 for the year.
 If we execute on all the marketing initiatives being considered, we expect to be in the bottom half of our non-GAAP net income diluted share range for the year. Also included in earnings guidance, as we discussed last quarter, the company continues to invest in development of CoStarGo and CoStar Suite in the U.K., which Andy mentioned. But we expect to incur costs to successfully launch these services in the U.K. market in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 We expect the launch of these products in the U.K. to be accompanied by approximately $700,000 in marketing spend. While this will impact the profitability in our U.K. segment in 2012, we expect these new products to accelerate revenue growth in the U.K. and begin to drive improvement in U.K. EBITDA margins in 2013.
 In summary, I'm very pleased to be able to share with you the strong second quarter results included with the combined CoStar and LoopNet businesses for the first time. While the results included some significant acquisition-related items in a partial quarter for LoopNet, the underlying business remained very strong and we have been able to maintain the momentum in both businesses as we began integration efforts.
 Additionally, we have begun to take actions that we believe will deliver the $20 million in annualized cost synergies, we expected when we announced the deal and remain confident in our ability to achieve these synergies within 24 months of the merger close.
 More importantly, based on our early cross-selling success, we believe more than ever in the revenue opportunities that are achievable by integrating these 2 great businesses, and introducing both customer bases to the outstanding value available by subscribing to both our information in analytic services as well as the industry's leading marketing solutions.
 CoStar is engaging with customers along the full spectrum of commercial real estate marketplace from mom-and-pop shops to the biggest names in the industry, and across the wide range of customers from brokers to owners, investors, banks, retailers, appraisers, just to name a few. We see an enormous opportunity for growth as the industry leader with the most complete and growing set of products and services to support this varied customer base.
 Based on the current health of the business, potential synergies and opportunities in front of us as the result of the LoopNet merger, which closed 2.5 months ago, we want to set a goal of $500 million in run-rate revenue by the end of 2014 with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low- to mid-30% range.
 We believe that this is an achievable benchmark that sets us on a realistic path towards our long-term goal of $1 million in high margin revenue.
 And with that, hopefully it was worth the wait, I'll open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question in queue from Bill Warmington from Raymond James. 
William Warmington: The -- a couple of housekeeping questions, the -- I wanted to ask what the CoStar, or are they actually  the LoopNet revenue contribution was? I wasn't sure if I caught that on a stand-alone basis. 
Brian Radecki: I don't think we've put it on a stand-alone basis, but we gave you the pro forma before adjustments, it grew year-over-year at about 10.7%. I think the businesses are combined so we're going to continue to report a combined number. 
William Warmington: Okay. So is there a way to get to the CoStar revenue without Loop, is what I'm trying to back into... 
Brian Radecki: I think we gave the year-over-year growth rates on that, too, on an organic basis, so I think that was 13.8%. 
Andrew Florance: And then it's important to note that going forward, there's going to be a lot of revenue moving back and forth between these entities. So if we're taking somebody from $89 of information or in product in LoopNet over to $509 of CoStar-ran revenue, you're going to see -- it'd be difficult for it to track what's happening there and what's actually original LoopNet revenue, what's original CoStar revenue. So it will get very blurred pretty quickly. What will be more relevant is probably total marketing revenue and total information revenue. 
Brian Radecki: What I can tell you, Bill is that when we announced the combined company's guidance, I gave a range of the CoStar's business to $70 million to $71 million, I can tell you we came in much above that number. And then, you get back in the Loop number, they came in much above the guided number, too. So both businesses, it wasn't like one did better than the other, they both were above the guided range, which is you can see the combined numbers of 85.2, well above the guided range. So that's... 
William Warmington: Got you. On the marketing spend, the -- it looks like it's about $2.2 million to $2.7 million, I want to make sure that, that number is right, does that include the $700,000 in the U.K.? And I just was going to ask how you plan on -- some detail on how you plan on spending the incremental marketing spend? 
Brian Radecki: Yes. I'll answer the first part and I'll let Andy answer the second part of it. The marketing spend -- now the U.K. is a separate number but again, it's all included in the guidance. I think your number is a little bit low, you'd have to sort of divide by the number -- you have to multiply by the number of shares and divide it by sort of the non-GAAP EPS tax rate of 38%. So your numbers are probably a little bit low, but the U.K. is not included there, but of course both of them are included in the guidance number. The timing -- we're working through the timing of that now so it might be late in Q3, it might push into Q4, it might push in a little bit next year, I think there'd be a big push in Q4 for sure. So that's why it's a pretty big range and the majority of it will hit in the fourth quarter. And so that will depend on where we end up in sort of our guidance range. And I'll let Andy talk about sort of what his thoughts are around the details of the marketing. 
Andrew Florance: Sure, I'd be happy to. So in the U.K., obviously it's a much smaller number of cities, a smaller economy. It will be a rollout of the CoStarGo app similar to the one we did in the United States with event-based marketing but just a much smaller scale because it's a smaller country. And that was very successful for us here in the U.S. So it's just a repeat of that. Then you have to consider those 130,000 leads and you're going to want to communicate with them with at least 4 pieces of direct mail along with supporting electronic initiatives. And then on the LoopNet side, creating -- we want to create awareness among the million listers in the -- million listings universe of CoStar for -- we want to let them know about the opportunity to generate greater awareness that are listings in the general business community, investor community through again a series of direct mail campaigns. We retained an agency in San Jose, that's done a great job putting together a campaign. We're going to be communicating with the people who broker the listings as well as the owners behind the listings. And we're going to do one marketing event that I'm not going to talk about and you couldn't imagine it in your wildest dreams, you'll see it on YouTube, I think you'll agree it's sort of funny and useful and effective. So we just believe that the opportunity is there. There's never -- if I'm a broker in San Diego working for CB Richard Ellis, it doesn't have any listings in the LoopNet systems, I don't think that person's ever considered trying to generate more leads for their listings using LoopNet. They've never received a direct mail piece from LoopNet, they've never received any sort of marketing from LoopNet, so I want to -- I mean any sort of traditional marketing media from LoopNet, so we want to break that ground quickly. 
William Warmington: Okay, Well now the Chicago tests sound very promising and I wanted to ask, what -- a couple of things. One is your thoughts on what it is -- and we went through some real detailed statistics but conceptually, what it is that has kept people from switching over from LoopNet to CoStar in the past and how are you going to overcome that? And then the -- also how you plan on attacking the markets? You'd go after the larger ones, smaller ones, how do you plan to do that? 
Andrew Florance: We'll definitely do a staggered lead system. We're going to migrate more people from our centralized operations into field operations to try to scale the number of people we've got in the field to deal with the opportunity. We'll definitely pursue some of the more likely leads based upon search activity, intensity of search activity, tenure inside the LoopNet system, and we will allocate out these leads to sales people, based upon their success in closing the leads they do receive. We feel comfortable with -- I mean we spent a fair amount of time and effort in researching how to present the products to these prospects. We -- I mean the reason they weren't considering it before is because LoopNet and CoStar Group were not one company, neither company could make the promise of having a one-stop shop where all the listings were in one place. Neither company could effectively communicate what was happening in a multimillion record databases that were changing by the hundreds of thousands every day, just it was too complicated. Now with one uniform back end, you can clearly communicate it, your message is completely credible, because they know that your briefcase has both LoopNet and CoStar. And so we're pretty excited about it. I described it briefly -- coming out that day in Chicago, I have described it briefly as the most exciting day of my life. 
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from the line of Brandon Dobell with William Blair. 
Brandon Dobell: A couple of things. First, I guess if I were to add up all the different metrics you guys have given us the past several quarters, it would be like 1,012. I'm trying to get an idea on a go-forward basis, are we going to get some consistent metrics like LoopNet used to provide on paying premium subscribers, that kind of stuff, so we can start to model this thing a little bit more accurately, if I guess on both the CoStar side, and the LoopNet side? Or how should we think about what metric should be the ones that we should be paying attention to that you guys are going to give us. 
Brian Radecki: Yes. So Brandon, it's Brian. So actually, if you went through the call, the reason why there's so many metrics because I gave pretty much almost every metric that CoStar had been giving in addition to every metric that LoopNet has been giving, so if you go back through it, you'll see all of them. And so we didn't really take any away, we gave the premium member number, we gave what they call ARPU, average revenue per member, we pretty much gave -- we gave the CoStar bookings number, I mean, we gave every number that each company always does. So it has been only 2.5 months, so we are looking at which -- how do we sort of combine these. We're obviously going to skinny it down and not give so many numbers. It's sort of funny, some people want more data and metrics and then other people want it streamlined. So we are going to streamline it, that's what I was saying. I think that -- obviously continue the renewal rate and the CoStar bookings numbers, are going to be is relevant because 75% of the business is still sort of CoStar, core CoStar information services. And I think that the LoopNet stuff will sort of be toned down a little bit, but we'll also come up with some new combined numbers. So next quarter I think we'll give you a little bit more clarity on some of those numbers. But if you go back through it, we gave you all of them. 
Andrew Florance: And Mr. Dobell, another thing that's going to be a little tricky is we don't want to spend too much time and energy focusing on the total LoopNet premium customers and the number of CoStar users. Because over the last -- over the next 12 months, I think that number will be a little deceptive because you don't quite understand the overlap in the duplicate level. Within -- our goal will be to try to integrate -- for exactly that reason, we're going to try to integrate the back ends of LoopNet and CoStar Group on an expediated basis. We'll make it a higher priority for the company. And the benefit, among other benefits -- one of the benefits will -- is that we'll be able to give you a -- just a unique customer number for the combined company that will actually allow you to effectively measure how we are doing in terms of capturing the scope of the opportunity. But when you're looking at LoopNet premium and CoStar members, that's going to have duplicative -- it's going to have overlap. 
Brandon Dobell: Okay. And then Brian, I wanted to clarify something in your remarks about the run rate. Exiting '14, you said low- to mid-30s adjusted EBITDA margins, is that for the whole of 2014? Or should we think of that as a fourth quarter -- potential range for 2014? 
Brian Radecki: Yes. I think both numbers are sort of an exiting run rate. And I think that's sort of the goal we're putting out there today. Obviously, Andy and I are very competitive, we like to beat goals, but the goal of $500 million run rate at a low- to mid-30% range exiting '14, which I think is a pretty good number. And that's really with all the things that we've talked about today sort of organically. So I think that again -- Andy and I obviously will do our best to do better. 
Brandon Dobell: Right. And then final question. Organic growth rates at both companies, a little bit faster than we thought we'd see it at CoStar, but pretty much in line with LoopNet. The CoStar organic growth rate, maybe some color on the puts and takes as we think about the next couple of quarters? You mentioned the Grubb and the DMGI termination in Q4 as potential noisy bits. But what else is out there that could move that organic growth rate around? And/or I guess in the back half of the year, are you assuming any material difference in those organic growth rates within your guidance?
 . 
Brian Radecki: Yes. I think last year we were anywhere from 8% to 12%, so it's fairly, steadily accelerating. Obviously you can see, we continue to accelerate for the first half of this year. LoopNet's, obviously, running at lower growth rates. So as a combined company, it obviously brings down the combined number. There are -- there is lots of noise in the back half of the year, accounting adjustments, deferred revenue adjustments. I did talk a little bit about -- we are evaluating various services that the company has that we might deemphasize or decide not to do anymore. We factored all that into there. So there is going to be a lot of noise in those numbers. But I think the 11% to 13% range, factoring in all that noise, is sort of a good range. And then obviously, as we see how those cross-selling goes -- I mean it's obviously going to be a big topic of conversation on the next couple of calls, what kind of results we see. Then, we can then give a little more clarity for next year. But clearly, I don't -- talking about all of those numbers, there's a good range out there for next year. And as we get more clarity in the cross-selling, hopefully, again, we can do better. But there is a lot of noise in the back half of the year, and I think I mentioned here, the fourth quarter typically -- again, I mean, everyone on the call has been following LoopNet, too. It's typically seasonally low for them. So again, we have to factor a lot of that noise in. But I think we're feeling very, very good about '13 and '14 based on the prospects. There are several important days in there. 
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from Brett Huff with Stephens. 
Brett Huff: Congrats on a nice quarter and giving us some longer-term guidance, guys. 
Andrew Florance: You're very welcome, we're glad to do that. 
Brett Huff: As you guys think about uses of capital, it seems like you're -- it's just all piling back into the business. And when you guys are doing that, give us a sense of how you make those decisions? I mean you've outlined them a little bit, you have a lot of levers that it seems that you can pull and invest in, and you've chosen a $0.10 to $0.12 lever with the cross-sale. How do you guys internally manage how you allocate that money, is it ROI-driven? Or -- what's the kind of process because it seems like there's a lot of choices that you could make? 
Andrew Florance: Well, it's ROI-driven, I would say. So there are a lot of choices you could make. We obviously -- you know we are -- we would have a 5-hour conference call -- earnings call, if we were to go through all the different things that are going on in the business. So when you look at all the opportunities out there, like we didn't touch on our French operations, our residential information product in Paris. So we look at things like -- the cross-selling opportunity to us, and to our board, is obviously the biggest ROI. And it has, in addition to having a what we perceive to be, or believe to be a very high ROI, it also has a real strategic urgency to it. You'd like to create the single stop-shop as quickly as you possibly can and get brand recognition for it. So that's what we're thinking about. It's the things that we believe are the "unconscionable if you don't do them" things. 
Brian Radecki: And Brett, there's so much leverage in the model. As everybody knows, going after this opportunity and then you talked about on the cross-selling and synergies is extremely high margin. Obviously, you're paying out some commissions on that, but we know -- we talked about having a 300-plus person combined sales force now. You have a large sales force, you have this large opportunity and ease dollar that you get in there is significantly high margin dollars. So I think clearly, when you look at the ROI and the potential for that, right now, it's -- I mean I think it's easy to say it's #1. I mean, it's the #1 opportunity for the company. 
Brett Huff: Okay, it's helpful. And then in terms of small cities, I know you all have -- were building the CoStar-based product to small cities, right, kind of as the recession started. LoopNet, I think, has probably better penetration there, and even Xceligent has some better penetration in the smaller cities. But I think that's -- to me, it seems like low-hanging fruit. Can you be fairly specific or give us a sense of what the small city strategy is from here? You know, is it CoStar Suite, I think, is what you call a particular product that might work there? Kind of where are we on that strategy? 
Andrew Florance: Sure. I would not begin my answer with accepting your characterization that Xceligent has achieved meaningful penetration in a small way, in small cities or anything of that nature. So in fact, we've actually done extremely well over the last 2 years in penetrating those smaller markets. So in the bottom 200 cities, we've seen phenomenal year-over-year growth and through our fly teams, which are based in DC and periodically travel in to certain targeted markets, they got -- they had great growth over the last 2 or 3 years. So these markets are now -- I would say, as a group, the smaller markets are profitable for us and are doing well. I would actually say that LoopNet's client base -- so you take Corpus Christi, Texas, LoopNet might have 100 customers there, 150 customers there, and that is more than CoStar has there. However, what I'm more focused on is the fact that LoopNet has 11,500 customers here in Los Angeles that we don't have. So the small markets today are successful and profitable for us. There is no market anywhere in the United States that I'm aware of, where anyone has any more penetration than we do. So the smallest market, biggest market, we got more penetration. But the story -- that smaller set's profitable and you can't walk away from them because they do make money, and -- but the real story is going to be Texas, Florida, California, the New York Tri-State area, that's just overwhelming, it's just stunning. Like if you -- we now have 19,000 users here in Los Angeles County. And that is just -- that's an amazing number. And so up selling that group is still just the 800-pound gorilla. 
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from Ian Corydon with B. Riley & Company. 
Ian Corydon: I wonder if you could just provide an update in CoStar Fusion and the analytical products that you have under development. 
Andrew Florance: Sure, I'd be happy to. We -- those hit the cutting room floor last night at Page 20 and 25. So we are making it -- the absence of discussing, I don't want anyone to think that we're not working on that. We -- I spent all day, Monday and Tuesday, with a combination of senior software execs from LoopNet and CoStar, and private design people from CoStar who are working on that. And I believe the specification for Fusion is now over 2,400 pages long. And we viewed and discussed the designs covering maybe only 700, 800 screens, Monday, Tuesday. And I am blown away by what the analytic side of our design team has produced, as led by a guy named Jay Spivey who came to us from -- the analytics side is led by a guy name Jay Spivey, who came to us from Jamison acquisition back in 1998, '99, been with us for a while. He did a phenomenal job, it was just stunning. It takes what we're doing in the analytics up 5 or 6 levels. In addition, our R&D quantitative team based at PPR has been working on some very interesting initiatives that will keep confidentiality part of that new analytic release. So it's very impressive stuff, it will not -- there's no chance that it will release anytime in the next 2 or 3 quarters and we will likely -- well, we'll be developing it. We will prioritize integration, we'll likely prioritize integration of the LoopNet, CoStar database first and foremost, because once you do that, it gives you more stability in the platform, it gives you better intel, better communication with shareholders, better marketing capability. It also frees up a lot of development resources to work on one common set of goals. So it's alive and well, it's fantastic, it will blow your mind when you see it, but it's of a scale and the scope that's quite significant. 
Operator: Our next question on queue will come from Marc Fuller with Needham. 
Marc Fuller: Just a question on the Chicago cross-selling. I'm kind of wondering, can you give us any more color on kind of how many regions outside of Chicago by the end of the year you might be penetrating or kind of selling into? And how many users -- end users does this kind of represent? 
Andrew Florance: Well, what we're going to do is -- we are now in a process of taking what we learned in Chicago. And initially, we have given a day of training to the sales force, we're going to do a follow-up training with them. We are, today, working on our strategy for utilizing an additional 40 of our salespeople, who've initially have worked in our centralized sales role to go out and hit the opportunity which is too big for our current field sales force to fully cover. Our first priority will be to go after the biggest cities. These massive pockets in California, Texas, and the like. So that will be the priority for the first 2 quarters or so. And then we'll be fanning out to cover the Corpus Christis and Albanys in 2013. And the number of users that this impacts, again, both LoopNet and CoStar, probably 80-plus percent of our users are in the top 100 MSAs, which is where we initially focus. And probably 80-plus are in the top 50 MSAs. So that's where the user accounts are, initially. 
Marc Fuller: Got you, got you. And then I'm not sure if I missed this, but did you say kind of how many -- what percentage of your bookings is from new users versus up sells? 
Andrew Florance: In Chicago? 
Marc Fuller: No, overall. 
Brian Radecki: Overall. It was approximately where it's always is, in the 50-50 percent range. I think some of the things that Andy was talking about was pretty much a couple of weeks ago. 
Andrew Florance: 2 weeks ago. 
Brian Radecki: So -- yes. There was really no impact at all in the second quarter. And obviously we'll have a lot more color on our next quarter's call for you guys. 
Marc Fuller: Cool. And then last question, did you mention how many CoStarGo users were added in Q2? 
Andrew Florance: We did not. Do we have that number? 
Brian Radecki: CoStarGo users. We do not have that in front of me but it's has continued to trend up. 
Andrew Florance: We're still getting -- we're still on year 1, I guess, probably a 10-year product life cycle on that and getting great feedback. 
Operator: Our next question in queue will come from Todd Lukasik with MorningStar. 
Todd Lukasik: Just a question on, let's say, the integration and the synergy. It sounds like you guys are still comfortable at sort of the $20 million in expected expense synergies. 
Andrew Florance: That's correct, yes. 
Todd Lukasik: And given the initial information you have from the Chicago market, are you guys -- can you share with us a number that you're thinking about for potential revenue synergies? Or maybe just ballpark, I mean, no greater than or less than expense synergy expectations? 
Andrew Florance: Well, without any doubt, dramatically greater than -- orders of magnitude greater than the expense synergies. So if you -- I don't know, if you took the -- what was the average sale so far? If you take the 15 units in Chicago and divide them into -- divide with it $8,800 sold so far. And then assume it's a 500% increase and then run that against the $130,000 against the 54% that said they would upgrade, the number's stupid big and we won't even say it. So it's orders of magnitudes larger than the synergies side. 
Todd Lukasik: Okay, got you. And then just with regards to the listings, are those -- did you say whether they are being integrated now, so anything that was in the LoopNet system but was not into CoStar, is now also in CoStar now? Or is that a future enhancement? 
Andrew Florance: No, that's done. We didn't waste any time there. It completed today, basically. So the systems ran today. And they've gotten through the listings. I think there were a handful of calls out still that were not in there, but basically they moved through the whole file. It's over 50,000 listings, several thousand new listers. And that was done in a combination of -- with Wayne and his team and Frank and his team connecting the databases automatically on a one-time basis, sort of in an automated fashion, one-time basis. And then taking out all of the exceptions to the research department, who then reached out and had conversations with those 50,000-some-odd listings over the last 2 weeks, 3 weeks. And -- but long term, we want us to be automated which is why we're going to integrate the back end, so that when you enter a listing in LoopNet, it's basically entered into CoStar automatically. It will go through a verification process but it gets -- it's basically the same database. So it will be technically impossible to have a valid listing in LoopNet that's not in CoStar. And ultimately, I think it will -- like initially, it actually increased our cost of research because your adding 50,000 listings, making hundreds of thousands of phone calls. Longer term, I think it will reduce our costs when it's automated. 
Todd Lukasik: Right, okay. But all of that, sort of, user-generated content is still going to be verified by your researchers? 
Andrew Florance: That's come across loud and clear in the focus groups with our customers that they are -- that's a top priority to them and it will. 
Todd Lukasik: Okay. And by your expectation is that -- that doesn't -- and you're not going to need more researchers to do that? You can do that with the current staff? 
Andrew Florance: I would guess we're going to get a significant productivity gain here, especially after we connect the databases and for a number of different reasons. You still have a trend, which I think that the coming together of LoopNet and CoStar Group will accelerate that trend, because now you have an even clearer picture in the industry of what the main clearing house is. And that trend is, people are creating more and more listings. So that prior -- putting a building up for sale was done with a lot of forethought and it was done less frequently. People are putting their buildings up for sale more and more frequently. So if I go back to 10 years ago in Washington DC, approximately 1% of the buildings in Washington DC were marketed for sale. Today, I believe the number is closer to -- 12% of all properties in Washington DC are being marketed for sale. So -- and against a database that's more than 50,000 properties in Washington DC. That's significant growth. So you've got people using CoStar or LoopNet as a clearing house more aggressively. That's good news, big picture for our role in the industry, the utility of the company and our potential revenue, it does put up a pressure to continue to grow the scope of people dealing with all of these people selling their buildings. But I think the 2 will balance out, and I think you'll get continued productivity gains and you get continued accelerations with the amount of content coming at us. 
Todd Lukasik: Right, okay. And then with regards to the sort of the year-end 2014 goals, $500 million run rate in annual revenue. I'm assuming that's based on an expectation of organic growth as opposed to unannounced acquisitions at this point? 
Brian Radecki: That's correct. I think, that should be clear, that's based on what we've talked about here today. So with, sort of, the product services, geography, things that we've talked about. 
Todd Lukasik: Yes, I guess you guys will be busy with the LoopNet stuff for a while. And then just with regards to the adjusted EBITDA margin, I mean as the low-30s to mid-30s that you gave there, is it safe to assume that the only adjustment between reported EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, that the expectation for that will be stock-based compensation expense at this point? 
Brian Radecki: Yes, I mean it's the same -- to say the same adjustments. So if we were to be doing other acquisitions or anything else down the road, which would be on top of those numbers, those -- it would be the same adjustments that we always have. But so barring any of those, yes, it's the same adjustments, nothing new. 
Operator: At this time, we have no additional questions in queue. Please continue. 
Andrew Florance: And with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you all for joining us and we appreciate your support. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to CoStar Group's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Rich Simonelli. Please go ahead. 
Richard Simonelli: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2012 conference call. We're delighted you have taken the time to join us. Before I turn the call over to Andy, I have some important facts for you. Certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially through such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar Group's April 25, 2012 press release on the first quarter results and on our filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, under the heading Risk Factors. 
 All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As a reminder, today's conference call is being broadcast live and in color over the Internet at www.costar.com. A replay will be available approximately 1 hour after the call concludes and will be available until May 26, 2012. To listen to the replay, call 1 (800) 475-6701 within the U.S. or Canada, or (320) 365-3844 outside the United States. The access code is 242701. And a replay of the call will be available on our website right after this call concludes. 
 This time, I'd like to turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? 
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Rich. Thank you all for joining us on this call to discuss CoStar Group's first quarter 2012 results. I'm happy to announce that the strong momentum we had in 2011 has continued through the first quarter of this year. It's great to come out of the gates so strong in 2012. Our revenue and sales growth has continued to accelerate. This is broad based and coming from across our products and our geographies, both domestic and international. 
 We recorded our 10th consecutive quarter of record revenue. We had first quarter revenue of $68.6 million. This is an exceptional increase of 15.1% over the first quarter of last year. Our first quarter annualized net new sales increased 23% year-over-year. With $8.4 million of annualized net new sales in the first quarter 2012, we achieved the highest first quarter net new sales quarter we've ever had. The U.S. economy hit a bit of mild turbulence in the first quarter 2012, and the first quarter is historically not our strongest sales quarter, so we're very pleased with the results.
 On the earnings side, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2012 grew by almost 21% over the first quarter last year, and our non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2012 was up 32% year-over-year to $8.2 million. You can find the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income to the GAAP basis results in our press release issued yesterday, which is available on our website, costar.com.
 Our in-quarter renewal rate for subscription-based services during the first quarter increased to 94%. This is the highest renewal rate we have had since the beginning of 2006 and is a very good number for us in the longer-term history. I continue to be particularly proud of the 98% renewal rate with our clients who have been with us for 5 years or more. We added 1,560 new individual subscribers in the first quarter of 2012. We now have nearly 95,000 paying subscribers, the most we've ever had. We expect to hit and look forward to hitting the 100,000 paying subscriber milestone in the not-too-distant future. Overall, I'm very pleased with the financial results we generated in the first quarter, and I feel that our team performed brilliantly. 
 I do not believe that improving economic conditions alone are driving our sales momentum. I believe that we now have the strongest sales organization we've ever had. We currently have more than 210 salespeople and sales managers, with 139 of those being quota-carrying field sales representatives. Our average field sales representative now has 39 months of experience. That is an average of the wide distribution. Many of our salespeople actually have 10 or more years of experience at this point.
 We typically see sales productivity increase with tenure. And this is the most tenured scaled up sales force we've ever enjoyed, which is a large part of the reason we believe we are seeing great results. In many organizations, salespeople focus exclusively on hunting new business. But in our business model, the key to success is placing equal priority on pursuing new business while continuing to strengthen our relationships and reinforce our value proposition with our existing clients. Our sales organization is now seasoned enough to understand that principle. That is another core reason why we're succeeding right now.
 Going into the last downturn, we, unlike many other companies, continue to invest in growing our organization in order to capture what we believe is a great achievable billion-dollar revenue opportunity, servicing the commercial real estate community's need for information. Because of that consistent approach to building our sales force, we have a large experienced sales force that have to fight hard to keep their customers during the downturn. The CoStar sales force is battle tested and proving -- performing beautifully with a slight economic tailwind now. This week and last, I had the opportunity to observe focus groups that a market research firm conducted with commercial real estate professionals who are both prospects and are customers. While I learned ways we can improve our performance from those folks, I also heard them clearly state 2 CoStar strengths. The first was, as I just discussed, our local field sales organization does an outstanding job of supporting them and making our products work for them. Secondly, the participants unequivocally stated that they "love CoStarGO." They conveyed that with passion and conviction. They feel that Apple's iPad teamed with our powerful commercial real estate information app is transforming the way they do business and empowering them in the field. 
 We just reached another milestone, 10,000 users for CoStarGo. In just over 7 months since the launch, commercial real estate professionals have enthusiastically embraced CoStar's mobile technology and have made it part of their daily routine. I believe we are just seeing the beginning of the impact and potential of CoStarGo. I've heard very positive feedback from retailers, brokers, owners and appraisers on CoStarGo. Despite that, only just over 10% of our users today have discovered this new platform. I believe that eventually most will use it. From informal surveys, it appears that only a minority of our clients even own an iPad. We noticed a surge of usage over the holidays at the end of 2011, as clients receive iPads as gifts, so we noticed a similar surge in usage when the new iPad came out recently. 
 As the functionality and penetration of the iPad increases, we believe the appeal of CoStarGo will increase with it. I spent a day last week with executives on our development team, reviewing new products and upgrades in our pipeline, and one of the things that impressed me the most was the wealth of potentially valuable new features we have planned for the CoStarGo platform.
 One of the development initiatives they would like to share with you now is our work on bringing CoStarGo to the U.K. market. We currently have a large component of our development team working on merging our U.K. research fulfillment and CRM systems into our U.S. software platform. That project has completed a number of key milestones successfully, and we expect it to be done by late this summer. We expect to complete a U.K. edition of CoStarGo at approximately the same time. Unlike the U.S., where we provide CoStarGo at no additional cost to our customers that subscribe to Property, Tenant, COMPS, in the U.K., we plan to sell CoStarGo as an add-on to our existing service there.
 Well over 90% of the top 50 brokerage firms in the United Kingdom currently subscribe to our services, but our U.K. pricing is generally much lower than our U.S. pricing, and we feel that CoStarGo will give us a great tool to help raise our average revenue per client in the U.K. We anticipate taking CoStarGo U.K. to market just after London Olympics, and we believe it will drive solid U.K. sales figures beginning in the fall.
 We plan to follow the release of CoStarGo with the U.K. version of our successful Property Professional, Tenant and COMPS suite of services. We believe that this initiative can add to the momentum we already see building in our U.K. sales numbers. For example in Q1 2012, U.K. net new sales increased more than 70% over Q1 2011 sales results. In fact, this month, we just signed the final top 10 U.K. chartered surveyor brokerage firm that was not already one of our clients. We believe that in combination, these initiatives and accomplishments will return the U.K. segment to a good profitability. Should we achieve solid profitability and good scale in the U.K., we think that will be an indicator of the potential global scale of the opportunity that CoStar can address.
 In addition to our U.K. and CoStarGo software development initiatives, we are also progressing on several other key software initiatives, most notably CoStar Fusion, our next generation web product that's expected to integrate the functionality of our current flagship product suite with elements of PPR analytics, showcase marketing, resolve asset management tools, virtual premise and various other new tools we're currently building. We believe that this is a significant software design project that could have a very positive impact on sales in 2013, in a similar fashion to the way CoStarGo positively impacted sales in 2011 and into the first quarter. I will update you further on these initiatives as they mature and they progress from product design phase into development in the coming quarters.
 I want to present a brief summary of current commercial real estate market conditions and how I believe they're giving us the economic environment we need to turn this into a -- to give us the kind of good performance we're seeing right now. We believe it is likely that this positive economic environment could potentially continue for years. If a commercial real estate market gets even better, we could expect similarly better results for CoStar. 
 Coming out of this recession, commercial real estate rents are well below the long-term inflation adjusted averages. Employment, though inconsistent, is growing, and in particular, office employment is really showing strong growth. Corporate profits continue at record levels and that's normally correlated with leasing activity. All of these facts are combining to drive a healthy level of property leasing activity. In fact, net absorption of office space had its eighth consecutive quarter of positive increase. Leasing drives commissions, and that supports our key clients' financial health. We are seeing very little construction activity. It remains at record lows. All of this means that office vacancy rates have fallen from 13.6% at their worst level in this cycle to 12.9% now. We expect they'll continue to fall for several years. We are, in fact, just reaching the point at which tightening supply can create the environment where rents will rise, which could further increase revenues for our core customer base.
 This creates some justified optimism as building sales in 2011 were up over 40% from 2010. In particular, because of increased financing availability, we've seen a noted increase in portfolio and large building sales. Since this increased volume means increased commissions, this is also a strong indicator for CoStar, as after leasing commissions, sales commissions are the next largest revenue driver for many of our clients and prospects. I continue to believe that commercial real estate markets are relatively stable, and that helps the outlook for CoStar in 2012 and beyond.
 Let's see, is there anything else I forgot? Finally, there's LoopNet. We recently announced that we reached an agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission on a consent decree that moves us closer to the completion of the merger with LoopNet. We are now awaiting final approval by the FTC commissioners, which, if granted, would allow us to close the deal. As of this call, we have not received the commissioners' approval, but we remain hopeful that we will receive such an approval and be in a position to close the merger by April 30, 2012. If that does not occur, the merger agreement does not automatically terminate on April 30, 2012 unless either CoStar or LoopNet exercise an affirmative election to terminate the merger agreement. With the FTC commissioners action pending, and to deal with the possibility of not being able to close by April 30, 2012, CoStar has extended its financing commitments for the merger past April 30, 2012.
 We are not providing details of the consent order pending the FTC's review and approval, but we believe that the proposed consent order will not affect our ability to realize the material benefits of the merger. In the event that we do not receive approval from the FTC -- I'm sorry, yes, in the event that we do receive approval from the FTC, we expect to schedule a conference call with investors shortly thereafter to discuss the terms of the consent and our initial plans for putting 2 companies together. We are not in a position to discuss the status of the potential LoopNet merger today beyond what we have said here and in previous statements.
 In summary, we're off to a great start in 2012. I believe that we will continue to bring a series of innovative and valuable products to market, which will drive sales and grow earnings as we move towards our $1 billion revenue goal.
 I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Brian Radecki. 
Brian Radecki: Thank you, Andy. We're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2012. Once again, we delivered strong revenue growth and earnings while continuing to invest in our business. Today, I'm going to primarily focus and discuss sequential results for the first quarter 2012, year-over-year trends and also our outlook for Q2 and the remainder of the year.
 Now to review our results for the first quarter 2012, beginning with revenue. The company reported $68.6 million of first quarter revenue, an increase of $2.4 million or 3.6% compared to revenue of $66.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue for the first quarter increased $9 million or 15.1% compared to Q1 of last year. Revenue growth is primarily attributable to CoStar's core suite of subscription services and again, driven by CoStarGo. We also reported $5.1 million in net income or $0.20 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2012 based on 25.5 million shares, which is consistent with the $5.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share, also based on 25.5 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
 Non-GAAP net income of $8.2 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012 compared to non-GAAP net income of $8.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP net income increased $2 million or 32% compared to the first quarter of 2011. And adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2012 was $15.3 million, an increase of $2.7 million or 21% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $12.6 million in the first quarter of 2011.
 The company had $576 million in cash and investments as of March 31, 2012, an increase of $3 million since last quarter. As we discussed in last quarter's call, we entered into a credit agreement during the quarter comprised of $175 million term loan facility and a $50 million revolving credit facility. Drawdown of these facilities is subject to the simultaneous closing of the proposed LoopNet acquisition. With the FTC commissioners action pending, as Andy mentioned, and to deal with the possibility of not being closed by April 30, we extended the financing commitments for the merger until May 31, 2012.
 Our customers continue to renew subscriptions at very high rates during the quarter. The in-quarter renewal rate was approximately 94%, which is the highest it's been since Q1 of 2006, and the 12-month trailing renewal rate for subscription-based revenue increased to approximately 93.4%, which is an improvement from the approximately 91.9% one year ago. The renewal rate for clients that have been our customers for 5 years or longer held consistent at an outstanding 98% in the first quarter of 2012 and renewal rate from firms that have been clients for less than 5 years also increased 2 percentage points to approximately 88%, up from 86% in prior quarters.  Subscription-based revenue accounted for approximately 94% of the company's total revenue in the first quarter similar to last quarter. And subscription revenue grew a solid 3.8% quarter-over-quarter and continues to drive overall revenue performance. 
 During the first quarter of 2012, the annual average contact value was $8,683, up 15% compared to the first quarter of last year. And total sales headcount was 213, up from 193 at the first quarter of 2011. Total number of paying subscribers increased to 94,956 in the first quarter of 2012, a net increase of 6,633 from a year ago, as Andy highlighted earlier. And the total number of subscription clients sites increased by 324 during the first quarter of 2012 to 18,507 company-wide. 
 I will now quickly cover the results for our income statement first of 2012 and also our outlook on the second quarter and full year.
 Gross margin was $44.3 million in Q1 of 2012, up slightly compared to $44.2 million in Q4 of 2011 and down slightly quarter-over-quarter. As I've stated on last quarter's call, we expect the gross margin percentage be slightly lower in the first quarter due to seasonal expenses and then grow thereafter.
 Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 was $35.7 million, a reduction of $700,000 compared to $36.4 million in the fourth quarter. G&A expenses declined in Q1 as there was reduced legal expenses related to the proposed LoopNet acquisition. John Coleman is shaking his head. Thank you, John. Let's hope that keeps going in that direction next quarter. Sales and marketing expenses also declined in the first quarter. As I discussed in our earnings guidance in February, we are making incremental investments in product development this year and those costs increased approximately $400,000 in the first quarter of 2012 compared to last quarter. 
 As I discussed in our last earnings release, one of our large customers filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2012. We remain in contact with the senior management of that customer during the bankruptcy process, and we continue to provide services to that company. If that contract were eventually terminated at some point later this year, it would have a significant short-term impact on our reported renewal rates, reducing the in-quarter rate by approximately 5 percentage points and our annualized renewal rate by approximately 1.5 percentage points. We believe our revenue guidance ranges, which I have given, adequately account for the uncertainty related to this customer from revenue. 
 Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2012 and our outlook which reflects all of our expectations as of today and takes into account recent trends, revenue growth rates, renewal rates, which may be impacted by the economic conditions in commercial real estate or by the overall global economy. Our outlook does not include the impact of the proposed acquisition of LoopNet or costs that are contingent among -- upon the closing the acquisition. We're not able to reasonably forecast whether or when certain acquisition-related costs may take place. Therefore, we are providing the outlook on a stand-alone basis, reflecting our current expectations as of today, April 26, 2012. Based on continued strong revenue in sales trends, we are raising 2012 revenue outlook by $3 million to a range of $284 million to $288 million. For the second quarter of 2012, we expect $70 million to $71 million in revenue.
 Consistent with the strong revenue trends, we are raising the estimate for non-GAAP net income per diluted share to approximately $1.32 to $1.40 per share on a fully diluted share base of $25.5 million. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.32 to $0.35. As discussed last quarter, the company continues to invest in new products, software development, including CoStar Suite and CoStarGo in the U.K. as well as the next generation of products in the U.S.
 If the LoopNet acquisition is approved by the FTC commissioners, and after the transaction closes, we expect to revise our outlook to include the impact of consolidating LoopNet on a pro rata basis from the close date and for the remainder of the year. Additionally, we expect the acquisition will be accretive for the year of 2012 and beyond for non-GAAP earnings per share. Our outlook will be adjusted to include LoopNet purchase accounting adjustments, including loss deferred revenue at LoopNet as well as various fees and expenses associated with the closing of the transaction and integrating the companies. Remember that the accounting for deferred revenue adjustment is -- temporarily reduces both top line and bottom line earnings and is not adjusted out of our non-GAAP net income.
 We expect our earnings guidance to be based on a non-GAAP earnings per share format, which we have used in the past, which will normalize out many of the other items, although, as usual, we will include a reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share. I should also note that our base of fully diluted shares will increase by approximately $1.9 million at the time of the close as a result of the issuance of the stock portion of the merger consideration exchange for LoopNet shares.
 As we had discussed when we first announced the proposed acquisition a year ago, we believe there are significant synergies associated with the combination of CoStar and LoopNet. If we close the transaction, we expect to focus initially on ensuring a successful integration and refining our detailed operating plans, including plans for realizing these synergies. We expect the synergies to ramp up in 2013, and that we will reach our $20 million run rate goal of synergies by the end of the 24-month period, following the proposed and projected close of the acquisition. Therefore, we are not projecting many synergies this year. If the FTC approves the acquisition, we expect to update our detailed operating plans with the LoopNet management team over the coming months as we incorporate these plans into our outlook, we will communicate them to you. 
 In summary, I'm very pleased to be able to share with you another strong quarter for CoStar that continues to build upon the strong momentum in sales, revenue, customer retention and earnings we saw accelerating throughout last year and through the first quarter. I continue to believe with the sales trends we are seeing and the investments we are making into our industry-leading products, CoStar is very well positioned to continue our progression towards the short-term goal of $500 million in high-margin annual revenue over the next several years and on our way to over our long-term revenue goal of $1 billion.
 Now, I'll open up the call for questions. 
Operator: We do have our first question coming from Bill Warmington with Raymond James. 
William Warmington: I wanted to ask about the 15.1% revenue growth in the quarter. How much of that is -- I think most of it is organic, but how much of it is coming from acquisitions? 
Brian Radecki: This is Brian. The majority of it obviously is organic. It's a couple -- I don't know the exact number, it's a couple of percentage points from virtual premise. But moving forward, it'll all be organic moving forward. So again, sort of -- we give you guys the numbers after the quarter of a close, and we'll do the same with LoopNet. But then moving after that, we're just going to be presenting consolidated numbers. So as you said, it was definitely mostly organic. 
William Warmington: Got it. And then if you could talk a little bit about the potential impact to R&D and marketing spending coming from the product pipeline? 
Andrew Florance: I don't see -- well, there's going to -- we're going to do a much, much smaller version of the CoStarGo rollout in the United Kingdom in the fall after the Olympics. That'll be -- obviously, since you're covering 4 or 5 states in the United Kingdom as opposed to 35 in the United States, it will be a much smaller number than we saw associated with the CoStarGo rollout in the United States this year or in 2011. So at current, we're not anticipating a material big increase associated with that product pipeline. The CoStar Fusion I mentioned is not something that's going to impact 2012, that would impact 2013. There probably would be a rollout associated with that similar to the CoStarGo rollout in the United States. 
William Warmington: And then the -- I wanted to ask if you could talk about a couple of the add-on products, if you will, for CoStarGo, just to give us a sense of what you're working on? 
Andrew Florance: Well, I'll just give you one that's probably out there. I don't want to disclose anything that is not out there because we do have competition. We have a really nice tour application, and it's something that, gets -- historically, when I go to look for 10,000 square feet of space with my brokers in some city, they will give me a 5-pound book with 60 pages of facts and figures and floor plans for the buildings I'm going to be looking at that day. That book is useless, and it really doesn't do you any good as you're moving around all these buildings, you're seeing 20 buildings as you move through Phoenix, and you can't turn the pages fast enough, and there's very little content in there. And then when you get back on the plane and go home, you don't want to be carrying this 5-pound, 20-pound book in your briefcase. What's much more effective is giving the tenant an iPad as you go to look at the properties and have the information of the properties up -- have information geo-aware, and as you arrive at the building the information on the property is coming up. You get 10 times as much information on the properties. The client can then put in feedback. The client can put in feedback about what they like about the building. They can rate the architectural appeal, how they think the location works for the company, how they think the space is built out. And the broker can instantly see that feedback as they move through the tour. And then there are usually multiple people on the tour, so they can all lock in their feedback as they go. The brokerage firm can capture that information, use it in trying to formulate the best solution for that company after they viewed 10, 15 buildings. Typically, from when you see the buildings, when you first tour the buildings to when you actually execute a lease of 6 months, by capturing that feedback sooner, I think you can bring in by a month or so that time it takes to execute a lease, which would be a significant value at the brokerage firms as well as the owners because it basically brings the revenue in sooner. So it's sort of a stupid 6 months it takes from viewing the property to executing a lease. Doing this Tenant version of the iPad app, I think, will help close that and I think it will be very well received by our customers. 
William Warmington: All right. On the Loop, I just wanted to ask if you could just... 
Andrew Florance: And the other 20 things, I'm not willing to talk about. 
William Warmington: All right. On Loop, I just want to know if you could quickly mention a review for us, what the timeline would be assuming an approval by the FTC Commissioner. You can pick a date, say, it's Monday the 30th is the date of approval. What would things look like after that? 
Brian Radecki: We're going to pull in a guest speaker to the call, so get the drumroll for John Coleman. 
Jonathan Coleman: Yes, actually, Brian, let me get Justin [ph] to answer that. Yes. Well, I mean, if we -- we're hopeful we'll get approval, and our plan would be to close sort of as expeditiously as possible after that. So I can't give you a definitive date, but it would be quickly thereafter. 
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. 
Brett Huff: My first question is -- and I apologize if you had addressed this before, I hopped on late, I think that you said that the U.K. pricing for Go would be a little bit different. And if so, what was the logic for that? Why make it different in the U.K. versus here? 
Andrew Florance: We've been -- the companies we acquired and integrated in the U.K. had fairly weak software or very weak software. And they also had weak information outside of Central London, so they had -- the price points we picked up when we acquire those companies were dramatically lower than the U.S. price points, typically about 1/3 of U.S. price points. As we bring in a very compelling product like CoStarGo, we don't feel that this is -- we don't feel that penetration is the right strategy in the U.K. We've got great penetration in the U.K. We think that additional revenue per customer is a better strategy there, and we think we can achieve it. So we might potentially charge something, a nominal like $19 a month per user to get the iPad app. It could be $29 per user. And we're going to execute a strategy in the U.K. of continuing to do something like that. So as we bring out the CoStar Property, Tenant, COMPS product in the U.K., which has advantages over the product mix currently there, that might be another $19 a month per user. So we're going to be working on bringing up the average price per user in the U.K., and it's sort of appropriate to the different situation on the ground there. 
Brett Huff: Great. That's helpful. And then, Brian, I just want to make sure that I understood what you said about Loop that presuming it closes sometime in the near term, which we hope it does, that the cost synergies would be effectively starting in 2013 and then, how did you characterize that they would ramp, did you say they'd get the full $20 million run rate by 4Q? 
Brian Radecki: Yes, I think -- obviously, initially, we have to close the deal. And once we do, we want to work pretty closely with them. So I think we'll have some, but I would just say very light this year. But then I think it would ramp up throughout the year, and I would say by the end of -- I'm just saying the end of the 24-month period because obviously I don't know exactly when we're going to close. Again, as John Coleman said, we are hopeful that it's soon and expeditious. So whenever that closing is you can sort of countdown the 24 months. I mean, obviously, we will strive to beat that, but that's sort of the stated goal out there. 
Brett Huff: Okay. And then last question is just on revenue synergies. You've talked a little bit about not very much overlapping customer bases and who has which products and sizes of those -- of customers that aren't in the overlap base. Any more qualitative or quantitative thoughts on revenue synergies, both amounts and timing now that we're, golly, a year-end to looking at this? 
Andrew Florance: Due to the gun-jumping rules associated with this process, where we can't jump in and see competitively sensitive data with LoopNet until after we close and have permission -- I'm sorry, until after we have permission from the FTC to close, we have not been able to do detailed comparison of customer bases and come up with a more quantitative analysis for you. I can tell you that qualitatively, we are extremely confident that there is a large prospect base for CoStar's information services within LoopNet's customer base, and we believe there -- we are very confident that there is a large potential to sell LoopNet's marketing services to CoStar's information customers. So we are very excited about that prospect, and we think it's substantive, but at this point, we're not prepared to give detailed numbers. 
Brett Huff: Okay. And then last question for me is just -- I'm looking at the CoStar base business. You guys talk about various penetrations in different verticals that you have, be it brokers and appraisers and et cetera. Have any of those really accelerated over the last several quarters such that things are really starting to click in a particular vertical that you've been working on? 
Andrew Florance: I would say that the good numbers we're seeing right now -- or one thing that I like about the good numbers is that they're across the board. We are making good progress in the financial services space, but we're also getting good, new brokerage firms and we're getting some retailers, so it's across the board. And also I should say, we could have 30 great quarters, and we're not moving the dial on the penetration. I mean, fortunately or unfortunately. So it's -- we're still relatively lightly penetrating into the potential market. So we might have 1/7 of the potential commercial banks right now signed up. We might have less than 1/10 of the potential owner customers signed up right now. 
Operator: We'll go to the line of Michael Huang with Needham. 
Michael Huang: So I just have a couple of quick questions for you. So first of all, I know it's a little bit early to be asking about revenue growth in 2013, but with the rollout of Fusion next year and the U.K. launch, I mean, would it be a stretch to see an acceleration scenario in 2013 or what's your just high-level thoughts around that? 
Andrew Florance: It's still early, and some of that is going to continue -- be sensitive to whether or not the commercial real estate recovery continues to accelerate or strengthen. But we -- during the call, I wrote down my sequential quarterly target for Brian, which I'm not going to share with you. But we're optimistic and we would like to see it accelerate in 2013, but it's still too early to really be able to talk about that. And a lot of things going -- if things -- if we -- should we be able to integrate LoopNet, roll out this Fusion product, it would be a good environment. 
Michael Huang: Got you. And I'm not sure if I missed this, but did you share with us the contribution of CoStarGo to the net new sales or the approximate contribution? And then as a follow-up to that, with 10,000 subscribers now on CoStarGo, do you have a target by end of year? And do adoption rates accelerate at some point in time given the references that you're building around these products? 
Brian Radecki: I'll take the first part of the question, and then I'll turn over to Andy for the second part. So on the first part, we didn't give a number on that. I think when we first started giving those out, I told people that we would give some initial numbers to start. We're still seeing, I mean, obviously, great traction. It's definitely one of the things we keep hearing when contracts come in, "I signed up because of CoStarGo." It's what we hear in the focus groups. But as I mentioned a couple of quarters ago, initially, when you roll that out because we're not charging specifically, well basically, it's for people that upgrade to the suite. It will be tarred over time as you get further and further away from the product release to say, "Okay, did Rich Simonelli sign up because of CoStarGo, or he just signed up because he was going to sign up for CoStar anyways?" So I think we won't be continuing to give those numbers, but it is clear anecdotally that it's continuing to drive. You see the acceleration in sales. You see the acceleration in revenue growth, and there's no doubt in my head that, that's behind it. 
Andrew Florance: Now, the exception to this, in the United Kingdom, we will be able to give you some clarity there since we're charging separately for it. 
Brian Radecki: Correct. That is correct. 
Michael Huang: Okay. And do you have a target number of users by end of the year on CoStarGo? 
Andrew Florance: We don't have a specific target. It is -- I think it's linear, and with searches around releases and holidays, which I take is a really good sign. So when you get 25% increase in usage because of Christmas, people getting iPad that says that you're -- you'd get a lot of traction ahead of you. So we don't have a specific number, but you could just basically take what we've reported in the last several calls, and you could extrapolate it linearly and surge it around the holidays. 
Michael Huang: Okay. And then last question on CoStar Fusion. Have you made any conclusions on how you're going to price this product both for new and existing customers? I know it's still early on that, but any thoughts on how this would be priced? 
Andrew Florance: We have not -- that's an active ongoing debate. I can tell you that we will probably have 2 variations of it, one with advanced analytics and one with basic analytics. So one version of CoStar Fusion will appear to -- appeal to hedge fund institutions who are typically PPR customers. That'll be the higher end version of it. And then we'll have a version that is geared to brokerage firms, who have a need for analytics but aren't doing -- do not have a need for advanced forecasting and the like. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: It looks like average new contract value is down sequentially. That was a little bit surprising to me. I would've thought that if people are signing up for CoStarGo, that might have been a higher ticket set of items. I just wanted to know if you could just talk a little bit about why sequentially that was a little bit lower? 
Brian Radecki: Sure. Toni, it's Brian. I think sequentially -- and I think we've talked about this on sort of prior calls, that number will jump around based on the mix of what we sell during the quarter. And definitely, the fourth quarter is always our strongest quarter of the year which people saw. But again, you can see the first quarter -- again, year-over-year it was very strong, and of course, that number was up year-over-year. So it's sort of always hard to compare the first quarter and the fourth quarter because of seasonality. So a better comparison I think is the fact that it was up year-over-year. But again, it does focus on the mix, and a lot of people signing up for CoStarGo might be upgrading from 2 to 3 products, so therefore it's not the same as if, for example, we had like a blowout quarter in financial services or something like that. So it definitely -- that's a number that's a good indicator, and it sort of describes sort of what was happening in the mix of products during the quarter. But because we have so many different products firing on all cylinders, it is going to move around every quarter. 
Andrew Florance: And you do get a financial services surge in the fourth quarter. 
Brian Radecki: Correct. 
Andrew Florance: And so that takes your average sales price up. One nice thing about a potential LoopNet merger is we have inverse cyclicality, so it would actually do some smoothing between that first and fourth quarter. 
Brian Radecki: Correct. They typically have, yes, their strongest quarter in the first quarter, and the fourth quarter is usually not as strong. 
Toni Kaplan: Got it. And you mentioned earlier on the call that the health of the commercial real estate market is starting to improve. And I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing environment. Are you able to push through higher rates as the environment gets better? 
Andrew Florance: We have -- during the downturn, we suspended any counter price increases, even CPI increases. We are pushing through basic approximate CPI price increases, and we're not getting any pushback that I'm aware of for that. But if you were to take from '05 to 2012, it's not an inflation-adjusted big jump. We still continue to believe that penetration is the more important thing to focus on. So -- and also, we have the ability to keep on selling additional modules, which is a better received way to increase total revenue from a customer than price increases. 
Brian Radecki: Yes. Just to add onto what Andy said, I mean, that's some pretty typical -- over the past decade, our contracts -- our annual contracts generally that auto renew, and they have obviously protection in there, basically the CPI protection in there, so obviously, if CPI went up. Over that decade, it's average someplace in the 2%, 3%, so it's not a significant number. But again, I would anticipate much change from that moving forward. Again, as Andy said it's really more about penetration, people adding new modules, adding new geography and those types of things than it is about price increases. 
Andrew Florance: CoStar products are still the best bargain a brokerage firm ever finds. 
Operator: We will go to the line of Timo Connor with William Blair. 
Timo Connor: I think you touched on this a little bit, but is it fair to say that the net new sales attributable to CoStarGo were similar to the third and fourth quarters of last year? 
Andrew Florance: Yes, I would say that they're similar, but again I think it's getting harder and harder to sort of track those. So when you first release it, it's pretty easy. I think as time goes on, it's not like we're asking every single salesperson to ask the client, "Please attribute, did you sign up because you think the service is great or did you sign up from CoStarGo." So I think, again, it's sort of something that when you initially release it, it's easier to track. It gets a little bit more difficult. So, yes, I would say that anecdotally, it continues -- we continue to hear from salespeople that, that's one of the reasons why people are signing up. Again, as Andy mentioned, in the U.K., we'll actually be priced, and we'll actually be charging for -- so something like that in the U.K. we'll be able to continue to track moving forward. 
Timo Connor: Okay. And then Andy said the -- you expect adoption for that to be linear. Is that in terms of number of users, or is it net new sales driven by the app? 
Andrew Florance: I think it would be  number of users. I think you can -- I think it sort of holds the -- I think it holds the tailwind effect it's having on sales for several years. But I think the user adoption actually goes a little higher. In the U.K., it would be 1:1. So in the U.K., it would both be user and revenue growth. So we ultimately expect, whether it be HTML5 on a tablet other than Apple or whether it's Apple, I would expect to see 75%, 85% of our usage eventually become mobile. In the focus groups last week, we had several people comment that they are using CoStarGo at their desk rather than using the web platform. So I think it's an entire operating system shift or platform shift, which is great. It's a much more powerful tool. 
Timo Connor: Okay, great. And then you mentioned that you're getting, I guess, I would call a benefit from good end markets on the sales side versus leasing. What is the breakdown for CoStar only of sort of customers who are in sales versus leasing and then sort of other? If you just had to break them into broad buckets? 
Andrew Florance: I would probably say that -- so 50% or little less than 50% of our customers are brokerage, and those are the folks who are going to be very sensitive to things like leasing activity and sales volume. And within that space, I would say that it is probably 75% to 80% leasing and 20% to 25% sales sensitive. But every brokerage firm -- or I'm sorry, not every brokerage firm, but every significant brokerage firm is going to have a combination of both in their financials. So it's sort of a blended result. But we are -- we've been seeing a good environment leasing now for more than 18 months, 24 months, and we're now beginning to see -- we've been seeing a good investment sales environment for about a year. And we have seen a good general commercial sales, which is the $4 million properties, which is really the bulk of the U.S. sales activity. We've been seeing a good environment there for about one quarter. And so that was just starting to take off. 
Timo Connor: And what are the exposures for LoopNet? 
Andrew Florance: The last one I mentioned. I think LoopNet is very strong in the sub-$2 million sale area, general commercial. So they'll have growth around that. And their other sensitivity is that they have sensitivity to the leasing environment but differently than CoStar does. When there's no leasing activity like in '08, people just don't have marketing budgets, so they see a little bit drive for revenue. And then they move into a good environment when the vacancy rates just begin to move downward a little bit. And I would think that when they get down to extraordinarily low vacancy rates like San Francisco at '99, they also do poorly because no one needs to advertise anything because everything leases automatically. So they likely have a 5-year positive environment from here given traditional real estate cycles. 
Timo Connor: Okay. Final one for me is, I'm not sure if it was touched on today or in the first quarter call, but what -- did sales force incentives change for this year? And then would you revisit those when or if the LoopNet deal gets done? 
Andrew Florance: We -- each year, in January, we tweak the sales incentives. This year, we turned the dial from client retention to hunting a little bit more. So in a bad market, we put additional incentive on driving usage and retaining customers. Now that the economy has a little tailwind, we've moved the dial a little bit more towards net production or the hunting. Still, that's a major component for driving usage and retention. And then we also have some lucrative sales contest, which the sales force find highly motivational. And last year, it was pure new client acquisition. This year, it is more about retention and overall year-over-year acceleration of performance on net sales. So a little bit more -- summary, a little bit more aggressive on net new sales, on just revenue growth. 
Timo Connor: Okay. And then would that change post LoopNet? 
Andrew Florance: It would likely shift to more teaming efforts between sales forces. 
Operator: And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Please continue. 
Andrew Florance: Well, with that, I would like to thank you for joining us from here in our San Francisco sales office for our Q1 earnings call. We'll look forward to updating you on our progress with LoopNet and our second quarter earnings call. Thank you for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thanks again for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-23 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CoStar Group's Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Simonelli. Please go ahead. 
Richard Simonelli: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to CoStar Group's fourth quarter and year-end 2011 conference call. On the call today are CoStar Group's Founder and CEO, Andrew Florance; CFO, Brian Radecki; and myself. We're delighted that you all could join us today.

A replay of this call will also be available on our website soon after the call concludes. So now, without further ado, I turn the call over to Andy Florance. Andy? 
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Rich. Thank you all for joining us on this call to discuss CoStar's groups year-end and fourth quarter 2011 results. Again, I'm happy to announce that we had another strong quarter and outstanding year overall in 2011. Here are some of the highlights of 2011. We achieved our best year ever, our best quarter ever, and our best monthly sales results ever. We had record revenue exceeding a quarter of $1 billion for the first time and a 13.7% year-over-year growth rate. We launched CoStarGo, a revolutionary new product that puts our industry-leading information on to a mobile platform in the field where our clients need it most. CoStarGo generated nearly $5 million in annualized sales after being available for only 2 quarters in 2011. It has been a key driver of sales to new and existing clients, and we expect that trend to continue in 2012. 
 We announced the agreement to acquire LoopNet, which we believe will be a very positive potential combination of 2 industry-leading, complementary and innovative companies that could better serve the industry and provide excellent cross-selling opportunities and efficiencies and cost savings. We raised $250 million in equity to help finance the potential purchase of LoopNet, and we recently signed an agreement for a $225 million credit facility that will be used to help fund that transaction. We completed the sale leaseback of our Washington D.C. headquarters at $60 million above our original purchase price from a year after buying the building. The purchase was recognized as the office deal of the year for 2010, and maybe the sale leaseback will get similar recognition in 2011. 
 I believe we received a huge branding benefit within our industry since we used the CoStar database and PPR analytics to capture that opportunity. We achieved a key milestone in integration of PPR analytics and forecasting division, replacing the very limited data previously used for analytics and forecasting with CoStar's more comprehensive and much more granular data. We believe this will provide PPR clients with a much more timely and precise understanding of the market, which we expect will give PPR a tremendous competitive advantage in the analytics space. We completed the acquisition of Virtual Premise, a leading provider of SaaS-based lease management tools. By matching CoStar's strong information and product design capabilities with Virtual Premise's lease management products, we believe we can bring significant value to our combined client base and create another strong platform for growth. 
 Our balance sheet is very strong. We ended 2011 with $573 million in cash investments. We expect to use some cash on hand along with the addition of manageable [indiscernible] debt upon the possible closing of the LoopNet transaction. I am particularly proud of this year's 98% renewal rate with clients who have been with us for 5-plus years. We now have approximately 93,396 paying subscribers, the most we've ever had. This demonstrates that we are providing very high-quality products and outstanding value to our clients. Overall, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in 2011, and I'm excited about where we're going as we continue to deliver leading-edge innovation in the commercial real estate information space. 
 Let me walk you through some of the details of the quarter and where we're heading in 2012. Annualized net new sales for the fourth quarter 2011 were $8.7 million, an increase of 86% year-over-year. There's no need to adjust the sound on your TV sets; you heard that correctly, 86% year-over-year. We have increased our sales in each of the last 9 consecutive quarters. We're elated to have crossed the $0.25 billion mark in revenues this year, and we believe it's an important milestone on the way of achieving our stated goal of generating $1 billion in revenues. We still believe we're only scratching the surface. We believe our current penetration is less than 20% of the potential markets of users of commercial real estate information products. There's still a lot of runaway out ahead of us. 
 We're charging ahead with CoStarGo, our other -- and other new software initiatives in 2012, which we believe will have equally high potential. As I mentioned, CoStarGo has been a key driver of our recent record sales. CoStarGo integrates information from CoStar's comprehensive property, tenant and comparable sales databases into a powerful but simple app on the iPad. CoStar Group Go was released in the middle of the third quarter of 2011 following a 34-city tour to introduce our new app to approximately 3,000 of the most active and influential commercial real estate brokers in the U.S. In the fourth quarter, we implemented an aggressive marketing campaign consisting of direct mail, e-mail marketing, print and online advertising and social media, and our salespeople conducted over 4,500 demos and trainings in CoStarGo. The results, total annualized net new sales associated to CoStarGo, as of the fourth quarter 2011, was $4.9 million, up from an annualized rate of $2.2 million in the third quarter, up from basically 0 in the second quarter, because we haven't launched it yet. Essentially, we have already recognized the return on the earnings we reinvested to launch this game-changing product. 
 CoStarGo has been the catalyst for long-time customers who previously bought 1 or 2 products to upgrade to the full suite of CoStar products. These are companies like Cassidy Turley, BT Commercial in San Francisco we're thrilled to have onboard, Colliers International and CNW Commerce [ph] in Seattle and Studley. We also added new customers like Colliers International in Columbus, Ohio; DESCO Group in St. Louis; and Flagstar Bank in Detroit. We believe we have developed a tool that's creating a sea change in how commercials [ph] and professionals in the field operate and access data. Already, 8,000 clients have downloaded the app and logged in; there's more everyday coming in. 
 When we launched CoStarGo, our customers told us it was amazingly fast and worked very well. But we were not satisfied with very well. We wanted to create an application that was exceptional. So we stayed close to our users, listened to their suggestions, stepped up the development and put our senior development team intensely focused, along with the product designers, to create an even better user experience. The result was 1,600 software enhancements to the product between the launch in August 15, 2011, and now, and that's just the beginning. But that 1,600 enhancements is an amazing number. We plan to continue to make additional updates on a regular basis with new features and enhancements that will make CoStarGo an even more effective tool for the Siri [ph] professional. 
 I believe that we will benefit from the meteoric growth of the iPad into the mainstream and its increasing acceptance as a business tool. It is hard to believe that the iPad is just 2 years old. It was only released in January 2010. Gartner Group estimates that annual iPad sales will grow from 47 million units in 2011 to 148 million in 2015. Doubtless, many of these units will be going to commercial real estate professionals. We believe as more brokers get iPads, more brokers will use CoStarGo. In fact, we noticed this as a mini trend during the Christmas season. As our clients receive iPads for the holidays, our logins to CoStarGo jumped 15% in the week following Christmas. The iPad 3 is due out this spring, and we believe it will have 4G LTE speed, higher screen resolution, a higher resolution camera overall. We believe as the volume of iPad shipped climbs, this will drive usage, and the expected iPad improvement will further increase the utility of the product we have designed for this device. 
 Since the launch of CoStarGo, we've seen a 20% increase in the usage of our web-based products. More than 1,300 clients who've never used our website products themselves began using our iPad product when it became available, and 57% of those new users also started using the web-based product as well. Many of these new users are top producers and senior brokers who may have thought it was uncool to do research on a desktop or laptop computer, but they appear to find the mobile product very attractive, accessible and cool. We believe this will continue to positively contribute to higher customer retention. 
 CoStarGo is not a one-off product for CoStar. It defines a powerful new method we're using in our product development going forward. In the past, our software design function resided within our software development group. While that may have worked, it tended to focus product design and engineering of the product rather than the customer experience, the value proposition, the visual appeal of the product. Last year, we created an independent design team that is comprised of extraordinarily talented graphic artists, staffed with thousands of hours of experience with our customers, former CoStar sales executives, former CoStar researchers, commercial real estate tech entrepreneurs, even former clients. This group reports directly into me. Since they're not all software engineers, they don't focus on how hard it will be to build something; rather they simply focus on designing an innovative, highly refined and perfected awesome product experience. I think our engineered teams like this process better because they recognize that this gives them the opportunity to work on more innovative, exciting, better designed, challenging new products. All in all, I believe this new process will reduce our development cost on a per project basis, while delivering more compelling products and more products overall. 
 With that in mind, we're in a process of reimagining our current web product. It is about to undergo a series of major upgrades and design enhancements that will incorporate a host of new features. This next-generation product is called CoStar Fusion [ph]. This will be a new product that brings together CoStar suite and analytics from PPR, financial tools, customer data and, we expect, eventually, Virtual Premise and Resolve. We expect this to be a premium product that we believe could become a significant revenue driver for CoStar in 2013. 
 Switching over to the other side of the pond, for those in the United States, we're nearing the completion of our project to integrate our U.K. sales, research and fulfillment process and data into our more powerful U.S. back-end software systems. We believe that we can complete this phase in April. We're working on modifying our iPad product to work in the U.K., and we expect to complete and release CoStarGo U.K. this summer. We believe we will see a solid revenue uplift for the release of CoStarGo in the U.K. By the end of 2012, we expect to release the rest of the U.S. product suite to the U.K. market. Again, with the expectation of generating revenue uplift. We believe that these initiatives will take the U.K. to profitability by year-end 2013 and continue to grow the margin there on out. This will be a significant upgrade to the U.K. commercial real estate market, and it will give the professional access to comprehensive information that has not previously been available in the U.K. 
 Another place we've been innovating is on the research side of the business. We noticed that our industry was hampered by lack of effective building quality ratings, which in turn made it difficult to impractical to effectively analyze market movements and investment opportunities. The only system out there has been the ad hoc ABC rating system used for office buildings only. There have been no definitions of what really distinguishes an A office building from a B office building, and so certainly no consistency from market to market on these ratings. And just 3 categories cannot cover the range and quality of buildings we encounter every day. The ABC systems often relied on the broker trying to sell the building, rating it himself, making the credibility of that rating system completely suspect. Finally, the system ignored retail, industrial, multifamily and land properties, which is the vast majority of the value of the commercial real estate in the United States. This backdrop was the perfect opportunity for CoStar Group. 
 In 2011, we introduced the CoStar five-star building rating system under the direction of Anthony Guma. Anthony holds a Master's of Science in Real Estate and Masters of Architecture from MIT. He has practiced and studied architecture in Europe, and he gained a solid understanding of rating systems while he worked in developing products for the U.S. Green Building Council. This new rating system provides more detail and consistency in comparing property assets across markets than the old ABC rating system. The CoStar building rating system also covers all property types. We are working hard to make this new system objective and responsive to the industry's needs. Since the launch, we've been speaking to and meeting with hundreds of industry professionals. We are winding up a 20-city tour of major cities all over the U.S. where we have been reaching out to owners, brokers and research directors for feedback to learn how we can refine the ratings and make them more accurate, relevant and to increase transparency in the process. The launch of the rating system has also helped us to improve the accuracy and quality of some of the listings in our database, as owners are even more inclined to proactively share information about their properties in order to meet our criteria and ensure the highest possible rating. Overall, the feedback from clients in this initiative has been very positive. 
 During the third quarter of 2011, we completed the integration of PPR's best-in-class analytics and forecasting tools with CoStar's comprehensive commercial property database. In November 2011, we began supplying PPR clients with analytics and forecasts based on CoStar's research-verified platform. One of our priorities in 2011 for PPR was to ensure we continue to invest in and continue to grow our accomplished team of thought leaders at PPR. We believe that PPR's thought leadership was already undisputed, but adding segment specialists was even more of a value add for our clients and prospects. So we added Walter Page to lead the office sector team. Walter was previously Vice President of Research at Equity Office in La Salle Investment Management. We also welcomed Rene Circ, who comes to PPR with 15 years of experience as a market strategist and real estate economist at Grubb & Ellis and First Industrial Real Estate Realty Trust. Mark Berry joined us in New York. Mark brings more than 20 years of experience as a portfolio manager and REIT analyst. He most recently was portfolio manager for Deutsche Bank's commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations. Prior to joining Deutsche Bank, he was a senior analyst with Green Street Advisors. We have also hired an accomplished multifamily economist who we expect to join the team soon and we will be able to announce shortly. I know many of you on the call are with institutions that are PPR customers, and my hope is that your firms will benefit from our new colleagues' insights.
 Turning to some other minor news, let's touch on the LoopNet acquisition. We're working diligently in an effort to bring the LoopNet acquisition to a conclusion. We are in ongoing discussions with the FTC staff in an attempt to reach a mutually acceptable consent order, and we feel the process has been productive. But as of yet, we have not reached a mutually acceptable agreement. We remain hopeful that these discussions might allow this deal to close in the not too terribly distant future. In the event that we reach an agreement with the FTC staff in the near future, we have recently secured the debt portion of financing needed to complete the LoopNet acquisition by entering into a credit agreement that provides for $175 million term loan facility and a $50 million revolving credit facility. Our CFO, Brian Radecki, will give you more details on this in a few minutes. 
 At the time of the announcement of the acquisition of LoopNet, we were confident the proposed combination of CoStar and LoopNet was good for our clients, the industry and our shareholders. After 9 months, our confidence that our investment thesis is sound has grown. We believe, even more now, that the cross-selling opportunities, greater efficiencies and combined innovation efforts will be great for the commercial real estate industry and our shareholders. While some may interpret my comments as optimistic, I think it's important to remind our shareholders that even in a scenario where, despite our best efforts, this deals might or could not close, we believe that this company, CoStar, as always, would absolutely have a great future going forward on a stand-alone basis. We believe the company would continue to deliver innovative products, grow revenue and profitability for many years to come. I also believe the  [indiscernible] holds true at LoopNet. In the meantime, we continue to make our very best efforts to work cooperatively with the Federal Trade Commission and any other relevant parties to reach an equitable and workable basis and to move forward on. 
 Finally, I want to present a brief summary of commercial real estate market conditions and how I believe they're creating and improving a positive environment for our business moving forward and potentially for some number of years to come. Coming out of [ph] recession, commercial estate rents for high-quality properties were well below, and still are well below, long-term inflation adjusted averages, while, at the same time, employment in many sectors is growing and corporate profits continue at record levels. This is resulting in some of the strongest leasing activity we've seen in years. Leasing activity drives leasing commissions and is the best indicator of our core client base's financial health. Net absorption of office space had its seventh consecutive quarter of positive increase led by top-tier U.S. cities. At the same time, commercial real estate construction activity and enhanced deliveries of new competitive supply is at all-time extreme historic lows. Because of this, vacancy rates continue to climb the vast majority of U.S. cities and will likely to continue to do so, which will ultimately drive rents upward. This recovery is broad with 2/3 of all U.S. sub-market's vacancy rates continue to move lower. 
 This is the best we've seen this benchmark in the last 10 years. This creates some justified optimism with commercial real estate investors, who believe that net operating incomes and properties will continue to improve, creating even more attractive yields compared to the very low yields available from alternative investments. Building sales volumes in 2011 were up over 40% versus 2010 volumes. Increased volumes mean increased commissions. Sales commissions are the next largest revenue driver for many of our clients and prospects, and this potentially bodes well for CoStar. Values for larger investment-grade properties stopped falling, began stabilizing and then climbed over the prior year. Now, in the past 2 quarters, values for general commercial real estate or smaller properties around the country, those values stopped falling and are now beginning to climb back up. We believe that LoopNet's business has more exposure to that economic sector, the smaller properties, and so I believe this is a very important positive indicator for their business environment. I continue to believe that the commercial real estate markets are stable and improving at a pace that helps the outlook for CoStar Group in 2012 and beyond. In summary, we're extremely proud of our financial performance in 2011, and I have never been more excited about the prospects for this business than I am now. I believe that we will continue to bring a series of innovative and valuable products to market, drive sales into these massive market opportunities and grow earnings as we move towards our $1 billion revenue goal. I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Brian Radecki. 
Brian Radecki: Thank you, Andy. We're very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter of 2011. Once again, we delivered strong revenue growth and earnings while continuing to invest in our business. Today, I'm going to focus on sequential results, year-over-year trends and also on our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2012. The company reported $66.2 million of fourth quarter 2011 revenue, an increase of $2.4 million, or 3.7% compared to revenue of $63.8 million in the third quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased $8 million, or 13.7% compared to last year. Full year revenues were $251.7 million, an increase of approximately 11.2% over revenues of $226.3 million for the full year of 2010. Sequential and year-over-year revenue growth was primarily attributable to growth in subscription revenues from our core suite of services, CoStar property, COMPS and Tenant, which was supercharged by CoStarGo. We also reported $5.2 million in net income or $0.20 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2011 based on 25.4 million shares compared to $2.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011 based on 25.3 million shares. This reflects the impact of approximately $3.1 million expenses associated with the proposed LoopNet merger, a decrease of $2.7 million compared to the third quarter. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $16 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $14 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $2 million or 14.3%. Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.6 million or 19.4% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP net income was $8.4 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to non-GAAP net income of $7.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and all of our non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call that are GAAP basis results are shown in detail along with definitions of those terms in our press release issued yesterday, and is also available on our website at the www.costar.com. If you have any further questions on those, e-mail Rich Simonelli. 
 The company had $573 million in cash and investments at December 31, 2011, a decrease of approximately $10 million since last quarter. We used approximately $15 million cash to complete the acquisition of Virtual Premise in the quarter. As previously reported, last week, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for $175 million term loan facility and $50 million revolving credit facility, each with a term of 5 years. Drawdown of these facilities is subject to the closing of the LoopNet acquisition, and the proceeds of the term loan facility are expected to be used along with the net proceeds of CoStar's June 2011 equity offering to pay a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs. The credit facility includes a group of 6 banks, with JPMorgan Chase bank as the administrative agent and sole lead arranger, and effectively replaces the fully committed term loan and revolving credit facilities disclosed at the time of the merger announcement. This credit agreement carries a rate of LIBOR plus 200. This $225 million term loan A facility will save the company 3% to 4% in interest costs or approximately $20 million over the duration of the loan, versus the term loan B structure, as indicated in the initial merger announcement. And by the way, my title is actually just Chief Financial Officer. I want to thank Charlie Colligan, our Treasurer who we hired last year, and his team and the finance team and accounting team and legal team that worked tirelessly to get this done. It's a tremendous agreement. The term loan facility amortizes beginning with 5% in year 1 and gradually increases to 50% in year 5. The entire amount of the revolving facility is available through its 5-year term. 
 Our customers continued to renew subscriptions at a very high rate during the fourth quarter of 2011. The end-quarter renewal rate exceeded 93%, which is an improvement from 91% one year ago. Additionally, the 12-month trailing renewal rate for subscription-based revenue remained at approximately 93%, which is an improvement from approximately 90% one year ago. The renewal rate for clients that have been our customers for 5-year or longer held constant and outstanding 98% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 2 percentage points in the same period in 2010. The renewal rate for firms that have been clients for less than 5 years is approximately 86%, which is consistent with 2010. Subscription-based revenue accounted for 94% of the company's total revenue in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the average annual new contract value was $9,277, up 4% from the third quarter of 2011, and our sales headcount totaled 209 sales reps, a 5% increase from 199 on staff at the end of the third quarter. Total number of paying subscribers increased to 93,396 in the fourth quarter of 2011, a net increase of 2,386 over last quarter, which is just great. The total number of subscription clients increased by 286 during the fourth quarter to 18,183. 
 I will now quickly cover other results from our income statement of fourth quarter 2011 and also provide the outlook for the first quarter and full year. Gross margin was $44.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, up approximately $1.5 million compared to $42.7 million in the third quarter. This performance results in a 3.3% year-over-year improvement in gross margin percentage from the fourth quarter to 66.7%. We expect gross margins to be slightly lower in the first quarter due to the seasonal expenses and then grow thereafter. 
 Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter 2011 was $36.4 million, a decrease of $3.3 million compared to $39.7 million at third quarter of 2011. As we indicated in last quarter's call, the fourth quarter 2011 sales and marketing expenses were expected to decrease as the third quarter includes the launch of CoStarGo, and these are partially offset by higher commissions, which resulted from our record sales quarter. G&A expenses were $15 million, which included $3.1 million expenses associated with the post [ph] LoopNet merger, which was down $2.7 million compared to expenses in Q3. 
 As you are probably already aware, one of our clients, Grubb & Ellis, recently filed for bankruptcy. This is not a material event for CoStar and will not significantly impact our financial results. No one client represents over 5% or more of our total revenue, and Grubb's annual revenue is significantly below that number. We have been in communication with the senior management of Grubb since we were made aware of the financial uncertainty, and the impact of these events is already reflected in our published 2011 financial results. We expect to continue to provide services to Grubb, and we pay for those services on a priority basis going forward from bankruptcy unless our contract is terminated as a part of the bankruptcy process. If the contract were to be terminated, the impact would be approximately a 5% point drop in our in-quarter renewal rate in that quarter and our reported annual renewal rate would drop by about 1.5%. While there are many possible outcomes related to Grubb & Ellis's bankruptcy proceedings that I previously mentioned, we believe our revenue guidance range adequately accounts for all these scenarios. 
 I will now discuss our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2011. Our guidance takes into account the recent trends, growth rates, renewal rates, which all may be impacted by the economic conditions in commercial real estate or the overall global economy. Our outlook includes Virtual Premise but does not include the impact of the proposed acquisition of LoopNet or costs that are contingent on the closing of the acquisition, as we're not able to reasonably forecast whether or when certain acquisition-related costs may take place. Therefore, we're providing outlook on a stand-alone basis reflected as our current expectations of today. Our guidance on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations remain consistent. We do not attempt to predict foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and our guidance assumes little to no volatility on that rate. The average rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 was USD $1.57 to GBP 1, and our 2012 guidance assumes a similar rate for the remainder of the year.  
 We expect revenues for the first quarter of 2012 in the range of $66.7 million to $67.7 million, and for the full year 2012, we expect revenue of approximately $281 million to $285 million. The continued strength of our core information sales over the past several quarters gives us a lot of confidence in our annual revenue outlook. In terms of earnings, we expect the first quarter 2012 fully diluted non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.27 to $0.31 based on 25.4 million shares. For our business, as I mentioned earlier, first quarter expenses traditionally include seasonally higher cost related to our annual sales conference and just increased personnel, payroll, taxes and benefit costs in the first quarter. We currently assume a 38% tax rate in order to approximate a long-term effective corporate tax rate. For the full year 2012, we expect non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $1.27 to $1.39. As Andy discussed earlier, we expect to continue to make incremental investments to improve our existing services as we launch new product offerings. We expect to invest an additional $3.5 million to $4.5 million in 2012 to develop the CoStar suite of products for the U.K. market including CoStarGo iPad app, which is expected to accelerate revenue growth in the U.K. We plan to increase our investment in new products in the U.S. by approximately $3 million to $4 million and expect to support these new product initiatives with some marketing programs later in the year. 
 We are extremely excited about this robust pipeline of new products, and we believe these investments will provide a basis for continued strong revenue growth and even stronger earnings growth next year and beyond. In summary, I'm very pleased with our record revenue results and strong earnings growth. The business model remains strong based on the fact that we have a 94% subscription-based business coupled with a 93% plus renewal rate for our services, the unique proprietary database, market-leading position, strong balance sheet and very high operating cash flow. As Andy mentioned, we crossed $0.25 billion in revenue this year, which is a great milestone, with momentum, and we are operating in a very large, multibillion-dollar space. I believe, with the sales trends we are seeing and the investments we are making in our industry-leading products, CoStar's position to continue to progress towards our previously stated goal of $1 billion of revenue at 40-plus percent adjusted EBITDA margins. I look forward to that progress and reporting to you each quarter, and now, we'll open up the call for any questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Raymond James. 
William Warmington: A question for you on the 2012 guidance. Just wanted to ask what kind of EBITDA guidance you are implying in that? I just want to make sure I'm doing the calculation correctly. 
Brian Radecki: Sure, Bill. I mean, I think we're giving just the non-GAAP EPS numbers, but you can -- in the back of the press release, I won't spend on the call going through every line, the detail of the reconciliations of the guidance, so you'll be able to see all the different lines. So you'll see exactly what we're sort of forecasting for the year for DLPs and everything like that. So we put a detailed reconciliation in there. 
William Warmington: Got it. And it sounds like it's going to be weighted, the expense, the 6.5 to 8.5 would be weighted how throughout the year? It sounds like the $3 million to $4 million would be more towards the second half for the U.S.? 
Andrew Florance: Yes, I mean, we're actually starting hiring right now for all of those positions. So anybody, developers anywhere in the country, please e-mail us, let us now. We're looking for a lot of great developers here. But in the first quarter, I think, it's just typical seasonality, you have higher payroll, taxes and benefits, and then we'll be ramping up pretty evenly throughout the year after that. So we're definitely looking now to see a ramp-up development this year; that's the main focus. 
William Warmington: Okay. And then I might also ask another housekeeping question on the -- the contribution of Virtual Premise in the quarter. That was probably small, but I just wanted to check that. 
Brian Radecki: Yes, it was pretty small. That was pretty small. And then as far as this year goes, we've just incorporated their numbers in to ours. They were on about $7 million run rate, of course that's prorated; we also lost about $2 million to $3 million in purchased accounting of their deferred revenue. So the number end up being fairly small, and I think with the Grubb & Ellis putting the range in there, they sort of offset each other. So all that's pretty much incorporated in the guidance. I think the 11.5% to 13% range is a very comfortable range for us. Obviously, we feel great about it. 
William Warmington: And so for the fourth quarter contribution, you're looking at less than 50 basis points to the growth? 
Brian Radecki: Yes. 
William Warmington: And then I wanted to ask about the expansion into the U.K. and whether you guys have the data in place there to support a CoStarGo type product? 
Andrew Florance: I would -- in answering the question, I'd say 2 things; one is I believe we do. It's not in the exact same format as the U.S. data structure, but it was kind of 4 years ago that we shut down the 15-person research operation in London and opened a 100-plus person operation in Glasgow, so that we could get the same level in nature and quality of data in the United Kingdom that we have in the United States. So there's no material anticipated ramp-up in the United Kingdom around research. The U.K. research team will be working very hard this year as they are tweaking the data to move it from the U.K. [indiscernible] into the U.S. enterprise system, but that has been, today, surprisingly well managed and looks like it's going smoothly. When we actually release the product, when we see it the first time in the U.K., I'm sure we'll see things that -- there'll be some gaps in the teeth that don't look quite right. But we will fix those quickly. And then ultimately, this is not really an expansion of costs; this should ultimately reduce our costs in the U.K. So we're pretty optimistic about it, and we're glad we're on the track we're on. 
William Warmington: Got it. And then for the last question, if you could comment on the strength that you're seeing in multifamily and whether that creates an opportunity for you guys. 
Andrew Florance: Well, I think we're seeing strength across most all of the sectors. I think multifamily is getting a little more media attention, a little more hype than the other sectors. So actually, I'm pretty jazzed about all the sectors. We have been collecting more and more data on multifamily. We're definitely climbing a curve there. And we do provide a multifamily advisory service and economic forecasting through PPR, which is being well received. 
Operator: Next question goes to the line of Brett Huff from Stephens. 
Brett Huff: A couple questions. One, just want to make sure I understand what's in and out of the guidance, and so I guess, Brian, this is for you. The additional marketing spend you talked about, is that in the 3.5 to 4.5 and/or the $3 million to $4 million that you called out in the release, or is that in addition to. And second question related to that is, whatever -- whether it's in or out of that number, is it contemplated, is the additional marketing spend contemplated in the guidance? 
Andrew Florance: Sure. The numbers I talked about the 3.5 to 4.5 and 3 to 4, those are pure development numbers, so that's really the investment in the development group with sort of there being a big piece in the U.K. and the U.S. The U.K. piece, that number that I outlined there, is not just development; there are some other costs in there, but I would say the majority of this is development. The U.S. piece is almost all development. The guidance does include sort of some marketing spend this year, so we've got some numbers in there. Clearly we'll keep evaluating things; a lot of it depends on when the timing of the marketing spend is all going to depend on when the products are released and when they come out. So some of it's a little bit hard to predict, but, I mean, I think overall, we're trying to account for all that. Just depends on the timing. 
Brett Huff: Okay. And then you mentioned again the long-term 40-percent plus pro forma EBITDA margin, and I think that was a combined company goal; is that still right? 
Brian Radecki: That's correct. And I think it's obviously a CoStar Group goal too. But it is also -- it would be if the proposed merger closes a combined company goal. 
Brett Huff: Any thought on the -- one of the things that I think, we, as investors, try to suss out is just how much you guys need to invest in order to continue your nice top-line revenue growth. Can you give us more color on how the spend that you've recently announced, just yesterday, is that going to be ongoing, does it stop, how does it fit or figure into that 40-plus goal? 
Andrew Florance: Well, we look at this investment as more opportunistic. As we look at some of the product concepts that we have developed and things that we want to do and bring to market, we think we have a number of very compelling, potentially very high-margin products we can bring to market, and we don't have to bring those things to market. We can continue to grow without bringing those things to market. But we think they're very compelling and that we should bring them to market, so we're basically reinvesting into higher-margin initiatives. They're optional only in that we would feel stupid not building them if we can. 
Brett Huff: Got you. And then last question for me, the gross margins, Brian, you mentioned a little bit, obviously, they were very good; much better than we thought. Can you tell us what's driving that? I mean, is this just the business, or is there something going on there. You mentioned they'd come down a little bit in 1Q but then continued to grow; what kind of expansion can we expect assuming standalone basis? 
Brian Radecki: Yes, I mean, I think that clearly, when you're growing revenue, I mean, we've always talked about it, when you got a relatively fixed cost structure in sort of the research area, I mean, each year we do invest a little bit more there, but essentially you're going to continue to see margins grow. I mean, the first quarter is always just a function of the fact that you've got, like I said, a lot of the seasonality and payroll benefits in that, and a thousand researchers in there, obviously a big chunk of all that seasonality ends up showing up in that line. So in general, yes, the first quarter is always going to be a little bit lower seasonality wise, and the expectation is, when you're growing revenue, you're going to be growing the margin line. So I would expect it to be a little lower in the first quarter. I think Q4 was exceptionally strong. We had a couple of expenses that didn't happen there that might flow over to Q1, but in general, I think that you're going to continue to see gross margin expansion after the seasonality in the first quarter based on strong revenue growth. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to the line of Michael Huang from Needham & Company. 
Michael Huang: Just a few questions for you guys. So first of all, I believe you mentioned that you did $4.9 million of CoStarGo related bookings in the quarter. How much of that was from new customers and how much was from up-sell. And then just wanted to clarify your comments around the holiday season iPad shipments. Was the strength of this, at all, due to that? And as a consequence, how does that -- how should we assume the level of this type of booking in Q1? 
Andrew Florance: I'm going to take an educated guess, and if Brian wants to provide a different color, that's great. But my feeling is this has been -- the CoStarGo associated sales have been a relatively even combination of completely new customer acquisitions and existing customer up-sells. Maybe a little skewed slightly to new customer up-sell, I mean, to existing customer up-sells, but it's probably in the 60-40 range there. I don't know that we have specifically an immediate revenue enhancement from the holiday season iPad shipping; what we saw was more of a usage jump, but it was material and clear. I mean, it was -- watching the line, it just stair stepped up to a new level following the holiday season. So I think ultimately it will definitely result in more revenue, and if there's a very popular iPad launch in March, I would expect another stair step in 2 things: One, slight limitation of the current price [ph] as that 3G speed, LTE speed, would definitely make it an even better client experience, looking at photos and aerials and maps on a high-resolution screen would be an even better customer experience. So an increase in volume of units as the new iPad 3 comes out along with a better customer experience I think will ultimately drive sales. But also, it's a little frustrating to me, like, we have a number of customers who are bringing home half a million in commissions a year who are slow to open up their wallet and drop their $700 on probably the most important business tool they could get, but with the iPad 3 coming out, we imagine they'll probably reduce prices on iPad 2 significantly, which will dramatically increase volumes. So we think all that this spring is good, good and better to keep the sales going for the CoStarGo. And this is not a product that taps out in 2 quarters. I think this product will be driving revenues for 8 quarters, 10 quarters solidly. Because we're only at -- we're not even at 10% yet of our customer base on this. 
Brian Radecki: And just to make, add onto that and make one clarification, it was $5 million annualized sales for sort of the 2 quarters that it was out, so it wasn't $5 million in the fourth quarter. So my comment on sort of bookings and where can those go, I think I said this last quarter and the quarter before, and so I'll say it again now, I mean, you can't, it's hard to predict breaking records every single quarter. The fourth quarter also tends to be seasonally one of our strongest quarters. So I think you got a combination of obviously growing momentum, iPad and then seasonality. So my expectation is the first quarter probably will not be as high as the fourth quarter, but I believe growing all year long and then of course overall great growth rate for the year, we're projecting up to 13%, even factoring in for something like the Grubb, so it could be even higher on that. So I definitely would not expect Q1 bookings to be the same. But again, overall, I think we're in for a great sales year. 
Michael Huang: And I know it's still early around, kind of, CoStarGo, but how have you seen this impact cost of acquisition for these new subscribers and length of sale cycle. Have you seen any notable changes that you could share with us? 
Andrew Florance: Yes, I do believe it's a shorter sales cycle. You're bringing in a piece of technology that frankly is sexy, and if all sales are emotional, this is definitely a faster sale cycle. Some of the bigger ones may not be that much faster, but the smaller ones, I think, definitely. 
Michael Huang: Okay. And my last question for you. So given CoStar Fusion and the launch in the U.K., what would you expect that to do to growth rate in 2013. I know you have no formal guidance around that, but could we see acceleration from 2012 levels, assuming no material change in the end commercial real estate market, or what's your kind of first flush thought on kind of what this could do? 
Andrew Florance: We'll take the 2 separately. I think with the U.K., I think that even if the U.K. were to triple its growth rate or quadruple its growth rate, it doesn't -- I don't think it'll materially move the dial for CoStar Group overall because it's a relatively small percentage of our revenue. It's more of a proof of concept that what we're looking for there is to be able to show that we can do a 30% margin, grow revenue in an overseas market. The much more meaningful revenue would be from a major enhancement to our U.S. product suite in the United States. That's the juggernaut where, no matter how fast these other initiatives grow, the core initiative grows -- at any pace, it's outgrowing the others. So this [ph] go right to that core market. And while it's extremely early, we're sitting here in the first part of '12 and this is a product that would really be about the first quarter of '13, I am extremely enthusiastic about the way this product looks, and if it's well executed, I think it will have a material and significant impact on our per salesperson productivity throughout 2013. It will certainly reenergize any kind of momentum we have from CoStarGo. 
Brian Radecki: And just a follow-up with that. So the U.K., people can look at the separate financials, and they're presented in U.S. dollars, but if you convert them back, they've been actually generally, relatively flat or low growth the last few years compared to CoStar, which has been growing, and one of the things we've identified there is it's because of the software. We believe we have great data. So I think the investment in the U.K., I believe will generate higher revenue growth in the U.K. as you rollout CoStarGo this summer and into the fall, and then the full suite of products by end of the year, early next year. As Andy mentioned, the U.K. is 8%, 9% of our business. If we were to close a proposed merger with LoopNet, it would drop to 4%. So it's not a huge piece of our business, but clearly, we're focused on getting their revenue growth rate up to ours in the U.S. or higher and also getting them up to profitability, and the way to do that is to invest in the software, which we haven't done yet. So I think that's the U.K. piece. On the U.S. piece, I think it's a little too early to predict growth rates, but clearly, the way we invested in CoStarGo this past year, we are now investing in some new products in the U.S. to obviously release and hopefully then keep the momentum going on growing revenue into next year. So obviously, where we sit today, we feel pretty good. As the year goes on, we'll obviously have a better feel for that as we know when the products come out and we see what the reactions to those are. 
Operator: And next we'll go to the line of Brandon Dobell from William Blair. 
Brandon Dobell: Couple of quick ones. Have been comparing sales cycles in new markets versus, looks like kind of a more mature markets these days; are you seeing any, I guess, [indiscernible] impact either from CoStarGo or just with the improving environment in commercial real estate? Are you seeing any shortening of the sales cycles, or is it still about what you've seen in the past couple of years? 
Andrew Florance: We are seeing something, I think, very materially different in the newer markets. So the newer markets, I would say, is, I would call newer markets that last round of 200 we entered after the 80 big ones, so if I'm looking at big establishments being New York, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Phoenix and so forth, those are doing well, moving along, but when I was preparing for this year's sales conference and I was reviewing the sales numbers in some detail, I saw one thing that really shocked me, and that was our performance in tertiary markets. So I was looking at numbers like our Buffalo, New York; our Lubbock, Texas; our Boise, Idaho numbers, and I was -- while they're relative, they don't move without the whole company that quickly [ph], I was sort of shocked at how well those markets are doing. So the markets like a Buffalo, where we could, just as an example, we could be doing, we were doing very little revenue before. We're now are doing $100,000, $200,000 in revenue, and what's driving that is a successful, centralized selling model. So people selling into these markets with a cleaner, simpler product offering from our centralized call center in Washington, and then also having a career path where people have [ph] centralized calling center into a sort of periodic visit to these secondary markets. So it's a pretty good trend. I think if that holds up and that keeps going, we're going to feel very good about our decision to go into those tertiary markets. They look really, really nice [ph] right now. [indiscernible] 
Brandon Dobell: During the fourth quarter, something came up with kind of, I guess, talk between you guys and CBRE about, I think it was the power broker rankings. Maybe a little color on what those rankings actually are and what this issue is, if there is an issue with this between you guys, or if that is kind of gone away as the quarter progressed? 
Andrew Florance: I don't recall what you're talking about. No. CB and CoStar Group have a very important, mutually symbiotic relationship through the years. And we have, we provide a lot of value to them, and they're a very, very important customer to us. They have had a policy that changes from time to time, where they don't want comparable sale data getting out to the market because they believe that, or comparable leasing to get out to the market, because they believe it gives their competitors some advantage and neutralizes their scale. And it's inconsistent. I think a short paragraph piece or 2 come out in Washington business something about it, and it's sort of blown over. We had a very good and productive meeting with my friend, Mike Lafitte, who's the President of CB over in Dallas last week. And I would say things are on a very good footing. 
Brandon Dobell: Okay. Perfect. Since nobody's asked the big elephant in the room question, I guess I'll be the guy to ask you about the LoopNet transaction. Maybe I'm reading too much into the words, but, I guess, should we assume that the transaction process is at this point, or has taken this long, because the FTC didn't like the deals or they saw there was something that they didn't like, either a market concentration or what have you. Or I guess asked another way, if the transaction does go forward, should we expect it to look like you guys thought it would back when you announced it midyear 2011? 
Andrew Florance: I have a lot to tell you about that, and I want to basically open up and tell you everything. 
Brandon Dobell: That would be fantastic. 
Andrew Florance: [indiscernible] have John Coleman answer that for you. 
Jonathan Coleman: Yes. Unfortunately, I mean, we're going to have stick to kind of what the disclosure is we've given. I think Andy said it best; we're working extremely hard to bring this to a close. The conversations have been very productive and we're hopeful to wrap this up in the near term and -- but I think we can't really get into more specifics than that at this point. 
Andrew Florance: I think what he said was, "Wah wah wah." 
Brandon Dobell: That's pretty much what I heard, I think. And then maybe more of a process question, is there something that we should look for that, just call it "restarts the clock" for kind of a final run of discussions, or could the next data point just be, hey, we got it completed or we didn't get it completed. Is there some interim step that kind of gives us a better timeline for how this may play out? Just from pure process perspective, or is there some part of the FTC process that we need to be aware of that you guys need to tell us about. 
Brian Radecki: I think, as we disclosed, there's this kind of 45-day period, and I mean, we would likely tell you if that 45 day trigger was pulled. So that would be, if that happened, you would certainly hear about that. But otherwise, hopefully the next thing you hear is that we've gotten where we're all trying to get to. 
Andrew Florance: I can tell you that they don't offer coffee in their conference rooms. 
Brandon Dobell: And then final question. How do we think about research and sales force headcount additions in 2012? I think Brian's talked about a 5% uptick this past year for sales force; should we see about the same kind of number this year, or you guys happy with how the headcount looks right now? 
Brian Radecki: Yes, I think as far as sales and research goes, sales, we're always adding a little bit, 5%, 7%, each year. So I would expect to see a sort of similar range there. I mean, nothing significant, but we, obviously, as the revenue base grows, we continue to grow the sales force a little bit. Very similar with research, very minor adds in research. So again, nothing significant there, and I think this goes to the conversation of gross margin growth. I mean, the first quarter is seasonal, but then after that, with revenue growth, we would continue to expect to grow gross margin. So some minor investments on both of those, but essentially, we think we've got great teams there. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And now we'll go to the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: I was wondering, are you having success in selling to [indiscernible] or, I mean it's sort of geared towards the larger or the broker segment, and I know brokers are the largest sort of client type that you have, but just wanted to hear if there was any surprising success with other customer types as well. 
Andrew Florance: It's a good point because I think we tend to, when we write things, we tend to always focus on the broker side of it. And definitely the brokers have responded very well to this product. But actually, I think that we're getting an equal and potentially even greater reaction from both retailers and institutions. So if you think about retailers, if you're a regional manager for a Starbucks, you are traveling all over the southwest going to different sites, and actually having all that data in your hand is pretty valuable and much more interesting [ph] that you have in the office. One of the things we do hope to do is eventually integrate the Virtual Premise leases that allows retailers -- the software that allows retailers to house their leases directly into the CoStarGo application. So when one of these retail acquisitions folks are in the field, they can see their existing leases plus all of our data wherever they're going on a location-centric interface. 
 Also some of the heaviest users of the product are some of our institutional customers. So our very best customers each year come to our PPR conference up in the Cape, the institutional customers, and we show them the iPad application CoStarGo, and we actually gave the attendees an iPad, and I was looking at usage, and the heaviest usage I'm seeing is from some of those attendees, and these are not brokers; these are folks who manage a $50 billion, $100 billion, $50 billion portfolio. So they actually find a lot value because they're from city to city, and being able to look up local market conditions, I think, is of interest to them. So we've probably done you a disservice on not focusing -- and talking about all the different segments that are using it, but it's being used across the board. We also have an upgrade coming to it, which is pretty cool, where -- and I know for competitive purposes, I shouldn't be blabbing, but, Steve Jobs would look down on me, but we have a cool thing coming where you can, if you're in a submarket in Austin, Texas, and you're looking at investment there, you can actually zoom in to the neighborhood and it is a realtime calculating statistics on vacancy absorption, price trends and the like on the area you're actually in, which is, for the commercial real estate world, pretty mindboggling. So that's something we think can bring out later this year. 
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And then once someone has the required suite for getting the iPad application, what's the up-selling opportunity from there? 
Brian Radecki: Well, so if someone has purchased the iPad application -- stepped up and are now purchasing all the items to get the iPad application, the next up-sell opportunity would be, depending on the customer, additional geographies, it could be Virtual Premise, it could be Resolve, it could be PPR. There are a whole range of other services. Almost nobody in our client base is buying everything we've got. I mean, we should actually look into that. I doubt there's anybody buying anything, and should that day occur, we'll develop something new. 
Operator: We currently have no further questions. Please continue. 
Andrew Florance: Well, at this point, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for this year-end and fourth quarter conference call. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on all of these initiatives we're pursuing at next quarter's conference call. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-10-21 11:00:00) =====

Analysts: Jon Maietta - Needham & Company Tim Connor - William Blair & Company James Wilson - JPMorgan Securities Chris Ramon - Deutsche Bank Bill Warmington - Raymond James Toni Kathryn - Morgan Stanley
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the CoStar Group’s third quarter 2010 conference call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instruction will be given at that time. (Operators Instructions). As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. Speaking on today's call, CoStar Group Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Florance; Chief Financial Officer, Brian Radecki; and Communications Director, Tim Trainor. At this time, I will turn the call conference over to Mr. Trainor. Please go ahead.
Tim Trainor: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to CoStar Group's third quarter 2010 conference call. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Andrew Florance, let me state that certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to, those stated in our press release on CoStar's third quarter 2010 results and in CoStar's filings with the SEC, including its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2010, under the heading risk factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements. As a reminder, today's conference call is all being broadcast live over the internet at www.costar.com/corporate/investor. And a replay will be available on our website one hour after this call concludes. Thank you for joining us. I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Florance: Thank you very much Tim, and welcome CoStar Group’s third quarter 2010 conference call. I am pleased to report to you during this past quarter CoStar observed improving commercial real estate market conditions and in that environment we achieved raising sales and extremely high renewal rates. While the key headlines for CoStar Group this quarter, is that we can now report that both the US office vacancy and availability rates have clearly stopped climbing and are now improving. These key fundamental industry indicators historically are highly correlated with our sales growth and renewal rates. During the third quarter of 2010 CoStar Group posted $57.1 million in quarterly revenue, an increase of 2.3% or $1.3 million over our second quarter 2010 revenue of $55.8 million. Revenues increased $3.6 million or over third quarter 2009 revenues of $53.6 million. $57.1 million is the highest quarterly revenue level that CoStar Group has yet achieved. Net new sales during the past quarter reached the highest level scene since the second quarter of 2008. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which we are reporting increasing sales productivity. For the third quarter of 2010 company wide quarterly net new sales totaled $4.6 million and nearly $1 million improvement over second quarter new sales of approximately $3.7 million. The third quarter net new sales of $4.6 million is a $3 million improvement over the first quarter of 2010 net new sales figure, $1.6 million. We are obviously very pleased to be able to report that net new sales in the third quarter of 2010 nearly tripled over net new sales in the first quarter of 2010. Our core product, the US CoStar Property Professional information suite was the biggest driver of our strengthening third quarter organic revenue growth. Our great progress in sales this past quarter was only possible because of the company's continued success in retaining customers. Our 12 month trailing renewal rate for subscription based services increased approximately 2% quarter-over-quarter, climbing to a very impressive level of approximately 90%. The in-quarter renewal rate increased 7% year-over-year. A 90% renewal rate is the highest level we have enjoyed since the second quarter of 2008. During the third quarter the renewal rate for clients that have then our customers for five years or more remained very strong at 96%. The third quarter 2010 renewal rate for firms that have been then our clients for less than five years also remained very high at 87% and very much improved from the 74% we were experiencing one year ago. I believe the great improvements we've seen our renewal rates are the direct result of the hard work and talent of CoStar’s sales force and a clear indication that our core customer base is returning to financial health. Commercial brokerage firms in particular have been very active recently and we continue to see strong demand from one of our largest client segments as tenants return to the market and leasing activity increases. Many brokerage firms have added users or subscribed to additional services and markets recently, including one of our largest clients, Grubb & Ellis, which recently signed a major contract extension for additional services during the third quarter. We believe that a 90% 12 month trailing renewal rate for our subscription based services combined with the fact the subscription base revenue accounted for approximately 94% of the company's total revenue in the third quarter, makes CoStar Group an exceptionally solid and attractive company. Our company’s solid balance sheet was $232 million in cash, cash equivalents and investment on hand at the end of the third quarter with no long term debt and a [mortgage rate] Class A office building to boot, all serve to enhance CoStar Group’s startling financial position. The total number of subscription client sites increased by 211 during the quarter to 16,508 company wide, and that’s in comparison to 16,297 in the second quarter. The total number of individual subscribers also increased by 486 during the third quarter to 86,803. CoStar continues to see strong demand from investors, banks and other financial services firms. We also continue to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities with our subsidiary Property Portfolio Research or PPR. One example of successful cross-selling to institutional clients was our third quarter subscription sale to Wells Real Estate funds. One of the largest private rates in the US, Wells agreed to purchase CoStar’s suite and PPR’s performance service. I understand our combined solution with chosen over several other good competitors. All state investments, an affiliate of the good hands people was also a major combined CoStar PPR effort this past quarter. Banks have also continued to be another good major source of sales. Our sales force has made a concerned effort to target banking firms and we have been tremendously successful in introducing and expanding CoStar’s services to this sector. So far this year 66 banks have become new subscribing clients. A strong regional bank called BB&T became a subscriber in February of this year, initially purchasing just a two years license. By the third quarter of this year BB&T had increased its subscription to a 40 user license. Partially reflecting the increase in sales for larger clients, our third quarter 2010 average new contracts signed increased 18% to 8,292 over the second quarter of 2010 to average new contract values of $7,031. Our sales organization and our sales management has performed exceptionally well throughout this downturn in driving usage, retaining clients and wining new business. They are now a better trained and more experience team than ever and they are looking forward to winning more new business as the economy recovers. At the end of the third quarter we had a total of 181 sales reps, down slightly from 194 on staff at the end of the second quarter 2010. This includes 118 US subscription sales reps, 7 US advertising sales reps, 34 in-house sales reps, 16 UK field sales reps and 6 sale reps for PPR and Resolve. We expect sale headcount to return to mid-year levels as the new sales training class moves into production. Given the continued strong demand we are seeing in almost all areas of our business, I am very excited about our current position. With the initial recovery underway in the commercial real estate economy I believe that CoStar’s tremendous research advantage and expanding platform will continue to drive strong sales growth in our sales and revenue. We’d like to take a moment to discuss current improving commercial real state market conditions in a bit more detail. In our last call I stated that our research had confirmed that office vacancy rates had stabilized in the second quarter of 2010 after nearly three year of steep increase. In the third quarterly we confirmed the major news that the US office vacancy rate and availability rate has never worse course and begun to decline and improve. This important market inflection point comes after two consecutive quarters of positive absorption of commercial office space and almost complete shutoff of new supply. We believe this improvement is the first in a series of steps towards overall improvement in the commercial real estate market. While this is certainly welcomed we are still very early in the recovery phase. It will take time before the recovery gains momentum and becomes wide spreads throughout the market. We will know that recovery has occurred when no one is talking about recovering anymore. Job growth is a key driver of commercials to recovery and the job growth we are seeing now is painfully slow. Although job growth has remained sluggish there continue to be strong leading indicators of future job growth including positive GDP, increasing corporate profits, strong productivity gains and a lot of temporary hiring. The US has posted two consecutive quarters of positive office employment growth. economy.com and others are continuing to forecast strong job growth over the next several years.  Although weak the job growth we have seen was strong enough to allow the US office market to post two quarters of positive net absorption with 7 million square feet of office space absorbed during the third quarter. This is a 2 million square feet increase over the 5 million square feet of office space absorbed in the second quarter. While this is not a large amount of absorption given the telesize of the US office market, it is significant because new commercials and constructions as I mentioned remains in all time low. So the positive absorption activity we are seeing is affectively working away at the extra space in the market. Recovering the capital markets tends to lag recover in the leasing market so it’s been so. This is certainly the case in the market now as the capital markets and commercial real estate sales remain unsettled. Sales volumes remain well off for overheated peaks but have nearly returned historical averages for commercial real estate before the bubble of 2004, 2007. Reflecting a market transitioned we're seeing different trends recurring in different segments of the market. Cap rates are up while sales volumes and prices are down across another second and third tier markets. In contrast, cap rates are declining while sales volumes and prices are up in first tier markets for leading cities such as New York, Washington DC, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles. Institutional great properties are beginning to show value appreciation after they may have perhaps over corrected in response of the collapse with the CMBS market and the complete lack of debt or funding for that kind of high end asset. This is driven by the current slight equality investment strategy among commercial real estate investors, especially (inaudible) and other large institutional investors with access to equity. What's interesting is that they all appeared to be target in the same core high quality buildings in CBDs that are well leased to credit tenants. A competition for these buildings just phenomenal with actual bidding awards breaking out in some cases. Last week I made a presentation at the recent Urban Land District Conference here in Washington DC and because our also sponsor of the Kennel panel with the discussion centered on this very issue. One panel has described the current investment sales market as an inward in a mile deep, with all of the major potential buyers targeted in the same select group of assets. Another panelist agreed adding that this is part of a global search for yield among large investors. In the current market with debt being relatively inexpensive, high quality core real estate assets stack up quite well in terms of yield compared with the equity and fixed income markets. We believe the path to market recovery is clear but modest. Our forecast for the office market cost for continued positive net absorption with the national average vacancy rates declining to under 12% in 2012. We believe that this renewed market activity is great news for our clients and also supports CoStar’s revenue growth prospects over the next several years. There is one downside to the emerging recovery, each time the commercial estate market crashes CoStar tends to pick up counter-cyclical crash related businesses much of it focused on loan defaults and workouts and I have to say this is a great attribute of the CoStar’s business the fact that we generate new business in down cycles that make us little cyclical. In due course there when the market recovery stat business goes away or the minimum maybe reduced. Fortunately the loss of any workout business we pickup during a downturn tends to pale in comparison to the new business generate in recovering market. I believe I previously provided the example of CoStar picking up the resolution trust corporation as a major client in 1990s, the RTC’s mission was completed and it wind down its operations once all the external assets have successfully been divested. Once they close the shop we lost that contract and there was not much to be done about that. This regional cycle has been no difference and won’t be different in the future. Last year PPR was selected as a sub-contractor under the Term Asset Bank Securities Loan Facility or TALF to provide analytics and forecasting services and support of this important program which is under the operation of fund Reserve Bank of New York. Roughly a year later, the legacy is CMBS portion of the TALF program is considered a success by almost any measure which is certainly good news for the market as a whole. We were pleased to win the contract and assist the TALF program, now having largely served the purpose that was hard to do, the program is no longer issuing new loans, therefore our services are no longer needed and our contract has ended. Our experience supporting TALF over the past year has been invaluable as we continue to develop our products in market position in the area of credit risk analytics. We are now seeing strong sales momentum in this area which is helping to offset the loss of this business. In the third quarter of 2010, CoStar’s research team remained focused and effective adding more than 160,000 new listing. For the year-to-date our research team has added nearly half a million new listings. Not only did these listing represent a half a million new opportunities for our customers today, they also provide the added value of half million new comparable sales and lease transaction that provide our customer such tremendous value, we now have approximately 1.5 million listings offered in our service. That’s a lot of listings. And for the first time our fore sale listing count grew to more than half a million listings during the third quarter of 2010. We now track 3.9 million properties combined in the US, UK and France. It won’t be long before we reach a 4 million property milestone. We believe this is the largest proactively researched or proprietary commercial real estate database ever built and that represents a huge competitive advantage in the market place. Showcase continued to perform well during the third quarter, our online marketing service now has 10,889 subscribers in both the US and UK, which is a 53% year-over-year increase compared to the third quarter of 2009. Showcase is now generating approximately $6 million in annualize revenue. The introduction of showcase in the United Kingdom this year has gone exceptionally well as we already have 510 paying UK subscribers, successfully capturing significant market share in a very short period of time. And I hope you recall, CoStar purchased a Class A office building in downtown Washington DC in the first quarter of 2010 to $41.25 million. This building will serve as our new headquarters in today the earnings call is being broadcast from the new headquarters. This headquarters has replaced our leased headquarters in the past 11 years and nearby with us in Maryland. The city of Washington invested considerable effort in crafting mutually beneficial tax incentive legislation enabling CoStar to move into the District of Colombia. That legislation requires CoStar among other things to increase by net 100, the number of district residents CoStar Group employs before we will be eligible for millions of dollars of potential tax and make them incentives. I am pleased to report that CoStar Group has both completed the move to our Washington headquarters and we have reached the important milestone of 100 net new district residents employed. This achievement should clear the path for us to pursue our significant potential tax and maintenance from the city. In fact we now have 458 employees working at our Washington headquarters. I believe morale is extremely high in this new HQ. We are exceeding our recruiting goals in our new facility and we appear to have improved employee retention. 50 of the 458 employees working in our new HQ transferred from our Colombia and White Marsh, Maryland research offices. I think of these transfers bring an influx of talent and great energy into our new HQ. The company did offer move allowances to dozens of employees in order to quickly staff the new HQ and retain talent. We have incurred a number of non-recurring expenses associated with our move to the new HQ, including move costs, double-ramped employee incentives and recruiting expenses. We are no longer paying rent besides the HQ, thank God, and most of these one-time expenses should slow going forward. And relate though that we are pleased to receive an award this month in a Washington, Downtown DC Business Improvement district for strengthening and diversifying the city’s employment base. According to the Downtown DC Business Improvement district, CoStar's relocation from the best of Maryland is the largest move into the district by a public or private company in 2010 and ranks among the largest such moves by a private employer in the past decade. We couldn't be happier with our decision to move to this new HQ, this is a fantastic building in a great location, that’s capable of accommodating our expected growth for many years to come. We intend to invest and complete the build out of our new HQ over the next nine months. So we could eventually house close to 727 HQ facility. And therefore our facility and IT staff was not busy enough during the third quarter. We also consolidated our three Boston offices into one facility at 33 Arch Street. With Resolve, PPR and CoStar, all literally right under one nice roof, you can see progress picking up speed towards building some amazingly powerful fully integrated software tools between these companies. I think some of the most valuable and impactful commercial real estate information analytic and forecasting tools ever built will be built in our new laboratory at 33 Arch Street. We expect that both our new headquarters and the new Boston office will be LEED Platinum, I believe that both of these new facilities are bringing our human capital together into more productive, consolidated facilities. I expect that these moves will increase retention, increase productivity and ultimately reduce our long term costs. Let me close my remarks by saying that I am very pleased with our company’s performance during the third quarter, increase in sales, high renewal rates and accelerated revenue growth clearly demonstrate renewed strength in our business. With commercial estate markets now in initial recovery mode, we fully expect to achieve additional high margin revenue growth through the fourth quarter and well into 2011 and beyond, thank you. I will now turn the call over to Brain Radecki, our CFO so he can discuss our quarter’s financial result in more detail.
Brian Radecki : As Andy mentioned, we are very pleased with the third quarter 2010 results. We achieved accelerating organic revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and saw a positive momentum continue in almost all areas of our business. Today I am principally focused on sequential results for the third quarter 2010 compared to second quarter 2010 and also on our outlook for the fourth quarter in full year 2010. We believe that sequential trends offer the most insight into the performance of our business as we continue to progress through the current economic and commercial real estate cycle. Our third quarter revenues came in stronger than anticipated that $57.1 million, an increase of a $1.3 million over this quarter 2010 and an increase to $3.6 million compared to the third quarter 2009. Our record revenue performance during the quarter was primarily driven by strong net new subscription sales for our core CoStar suite service offerings as well as the high renewal rates for our subscription services. International revenue on a functional currency basis was approximately $3.1 million pounds in the third quarter of 2010 essentially flat compared to the second quarter of 2010. International revenues were approximately 8.4% for the company total revenues in third quarter. Subscription revenues for the third quarter accounted for approximately 94% of our total revenues with their 12 months trailing renewal rate which everybody know that the measure of renewing subscription revenue was approximately 90%. We believe this is a very important measure for the strength of our business and are very excited to see the 12 months trailing renewal rate move back towards historical average of 90% and let me remind everybody this is two to three quarters ahead of where we originally projected. As I publicly stated on earnings call for over two years now, we expected that 12 months trailing renewal rate to decrease into the mid-80’s during the downturn and then begin to recover in 2010. Our in-quarter renewal rate for the third quarter was again high in the low-90s and I am pleased to report that the renewal rates continue to trend in the right direction. Please note that the in-quarter renewal rate which is a measure of subscription dollars renewing will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter across the (inaudible) approximately 2 percentage points. Therefore the overall trends and the 12 months trailing renewal rate are very important. We believe that moving from the low-80’s into 90’s all within a year is extremely positive news, over the next few quarters we continue to expect that 12 month trailing renewal rate to be in the high-80’s and low 90% range. Now turning to gross margin, gross margin was $36.4 million in the third quarter of 2010 it was up $900,000 compared to Q2 of 2010. In addition gross margin percentage increased from 63.7% to 63.5% from the second quarter of 2010 due to higher revenue in leverage and our model. Moving down the income statement, total operating expenses of third quarter of 2010 decreased by 800,000 to $30.2 million compared to $31 million in the second quarter of 2010. Third quarter of 2010 does include expenses of $1.3 million associated with the consolidation of the former PPR result in CoStar offices in Boston into a single facility which ran through the G&A line. We believe having those teams together and new Boston office will facilitate the integration product development in cross-selling initiatives we have been discussing with you for the past several quarters. Selling and marketing expenses was essentially flat in the third quarter. Looking at profitability, net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $3.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share and our non-GAAP net income was $6.9 million or $0.33 per diluted share, both above our previously guidance range. Quite simply we are very happy with the results on both the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis which reflects our stronger revenue and stronger operating results. Third quarter 2010 headquarter transition charges which Andy spoke earlier were approximately $1.3 million. We now expect those cost to be in the $2.7 million to $3 million range which is slightly lower than what we originally expected for the year. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2010 was $9.4 million, an increase of over $1.6 million compared to the second quarter of 2010. In adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $13.8 million or approximately 24% of revenue. Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call so that their GAAP basis results are shown in detail along with definitions for those terms and our press released issued yesterday which is available on our website on the internet at www.costar.com. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter 2010 with approximately $232 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, no long term debt in a shiny new building. I will now discuss our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. Our guidance takes into account recent trends, revenue growth rates, renewal rates which all maybe impacted by the economic conditions and commercial real estate or by the overall global economy. Our forward-looking guidance reflects our current expectations as of October 21, 2010. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter 2010 to be in the range of $57.1 million to $58.1 million. And for the full year 2010 we are once again raising the high end of our annual guidance range by $2 million as we did last quarter to approximately $225.1 million to $226.1 million. Continued strong demand for our services demonstrated by our 12 months around renewal rate moving back to the historic 90% average combined with consistent accelerating revenue growth in 2010 gives us a lot of confidence in our higher annual revenue outlook. Our guidance on the impact of foreign currency exchanges fluctuations and our top line results remain consistent. We do that and attempt to predict the foreign exchange rate fluctuations and our guidance assumes little to no volatility in the current rate. The average extent rate for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.55 US, so one British Pound and the remainder of our 2010 guidance into rate of 1.5. In terms of earnings, we expect the fourth quarter 2010 fully diluted income per share of approximately $0.15 to $0.18 and non-GAAP net income of $0.28 to $0.32. For the fourth quarter outlook for GAAP net income per diluted share we expect about $300,000 to $500,000 of remaining costs related to the transition of our new corporate headquarters in Washington DC in October, and approximately $2.5 million to $2.7 million in equity compensation charges. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 49% while again our annual rate we still expect to be 44%. For the full year 2010 we expect GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.61 to $0.64 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $1.20 to $1.24. We expect to achieve our annual earnings outlook even with the short term dilution of net income resulting from the legal settlements, costs associated with our ongoing efforts to reduce our facilities by moving our headquarters into a corporate-owned facility and consolidating in moving our Boston and UK offices. For our annual guidance range we are increasing the earnings projections based on the expectations for the increased revenues we discussed above. For the full year 2010 we expect approximately $2.7 million to $2.9 million of costs related to the transition of our new corporate headquarters and that is approximately $300,000 lower than what we provided last quarter. Additionally, we expect to close 2010 with approximately $1.3 million of the lease restructuring charge and $8.3 million to $8.4 million of equity comp expense. Costs in 2010 related to the acquisition and transition of the corporate headquarters, as Andy said, it was primarily overlapping costs incurred to the end of the lease term and the carrying cost with the building prior to our move, but then the headquarters lease expired October 15 and we completely to moved to that facility last week. We continue to believe we will create significant long-term value at the move to our new headquarters facility at Washington DC. In closing we are very pleased with our record revenue results in momentum we are in our business. Our business model remains strong based on the 94% subscription based in this model with a 90% renewal rate, our unique proprietary database, market leading position, strong balance sheet, no debt and very high operating cash flow. Based on the results we’ve seen in the past few quarters we believe we are well back on our way to a more normalized organic revenue rates in expanding margins that we have enjoyed with the past decade in the near future. Now that we are essentially through the majority of the consolidation of office space and operation in 2010, we believe we are well positioned to enjoy the revenue and earnings growth similar to what we enjoyed in the period of the second quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008, which was the last completion of our expansion investment phase. CoStar’s management team believes there is significant opportunity for addition high margin revenue from the investments we have made and believe in our long term goal of a billion dollars of commercial real estate information revenue at a 40% to 50% margin. We continue to look forward to reporting our progress to you, and with that I open it up to call for question.
Tim Trainor: So at this point we’ll take any question we’ve got in the queue.
Operator: (Operators Instructions) Our first question is going to come from the line of Jon Maietta with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: The first question I had was around your expectation for growth and Andy may be you can talk a little bit about the would you expect it to come from so obviously it will have a portion from the existing client base who will start to add, see if their business improved, you will see a piece from new services, incremental services and then you will have a piece obviously that comes from brand new client logos and I just hope that you can help me think about that mix?
Andy Florance: I actually look at this and I think the greatest driver for the next five years, four to five years we will new logos. There is an of a awful lot of customer based to go, prospect based to go after here in the United States, so we still have a North of 10,000 meaningful to sell our products and service to here in the United States. We have got a 1000 of retailers to sell our products to services too, there are 7000 plus banks with commercial real estate assets in their portfolio. Our successful compose product is only sold about 25 some units, we've got several total 100 on the CoStar property side but you still have 1000s to go there. And I think institutional space is one of the biggest opportunities for our business over the next the five years. So, big picture as the economy recovers and these prospects are more open to considering new affective investments we think we will able to pick up tractions in new logos organic growth. There certainly is a lot of opportunity for cross-selling in the existing customer base that’s always been half of our sales activity and I expect that to continue to be the case. As you know, we have begun to institute some minor price increases that keep us abreast or keep us a pace with any CPI activity that’s going on. But the main thing we are focused on as we know that there are thousands of good companies out there that would benefit from our products and it's a penetration story, it's a story that going after those names and those companies.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: And then could you just remind us where you are in terms of, you talked about the lower end bundling on the quarterly call last quarter just maybe where we are in that cycle and would you kind of saying there early days?
Andy Florance: Sure. The program begin last quarter focusing on bundling our Swedish services to these like the fourth tier markets into the summer smaller firms out there, so provide them with a tremendous value proposition for relatively low cost, and not doing that through our field sales force but instead using our centralized lower cost headquarter base sales force, that has gone well, it is I know that we are peaking up I believe hundreds of people that lower level and that group is internal sales group is a strong contributor to our sales growth right now but that is sort of a blocking and tackling things something we are doing but our real focus is probably at the middle to upper end of the marketplace, institutional marketplace the banks, the leading brokerage. So that's where the most of the revenue dollars can be pushed.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: And Brian just last question from me. If you could I don't see at the number but operating cash flow on the quarter and see the CapEx number as well?
Brian Radecki: Sure. Yeah. That CapEx number was about $6 million for the quarters and about $10 million to the year. I am sure there are a lot of CapEx related to our new facilities and we believe the operating cash flow is about $27 million for the year I think it’s above the $7 million mark for the third quarter.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Tim Connor with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Tim Connor - William Blair & Company: Couple of questions, first just wanted to ask about price impact on renewals and on new business?
Brian Radecki: The best of my knowledge there has been zero impact. I have not heard a single comment from anyone of our sales organization about any prospect whatsoever any of this price increase. I think the CoStar Group took a very, very client focused conservative stands going into the downturn when we proactively, immediately stopped a new price increases anywhere even the one that we could contractually take, so I think the costumers are certainly comfortable with our pricing policies and for us to re-institute our price increases that just got us back to CPI from the last year, so I think there is zero push back I haven’t heard a single thing out in branch or anything either.
Tim Connor - William Blair & Company: No push back on.
Andrew Florance: No it’s going well.
Tim Connor - William Blair & Company: Would you say that’s a function of just their improving business or it is something else?
Andrew Florance: I think it’s definitely a function of their improving business and the fact that CoStar Group services are really risky important tool for them to be able to productively go and do what they do and do they make money. So what they pay for our services is relatively small compared to the value they are getting from and as long as we have a reputation of being fair in the marketplace, you are getting pushed back in. And we’ve been doing this for a long time now, so I think that it’s certainly a good sense of when the customers are going feel they are getting pushed and they are not feel they are being crushed right now.
Tim Connor - William Blair & Company: Okay and one more customer question on DSO trends. How far do you think those can continue and anecdotally would you think?
Brian Radecki: I am sorry repeat that again.
Tim Connor - William Blair & Company: So customer payment behavior, DSO trends had been improving. How far do you think you see those coming and do you have any anecdotal stories on that?
Andrew Florance: Sure. I think that the payment trends continue to improve, DSOs continue to improve and our aging has just, I mean I compare it to last year it’s like night and day, and it really what if this goes to the overall how the client and the business and really sort of you know we talked about in prior call sort of the client that were unhealthy we really lost in the past year, I think now that’s why you see the renewal rates going up you see improved collections you know bad debt you know half of what it was last year so I will continue to expect that to move in a positive direction I don’t see anything on the radar screen right now, unless something significant changes in the global economy to really move to dial over there next few quarters there. So, it’s very positive.
Brian Radecki: I think he saying a sandbag, any CFO worth his salt can give DSOs to four days.
Tim Connor - William Blair & Company: And then stashing levels are you comfortable with these and then plans for your future on this?
Brian Radecki: Right now we are coupled with our staffing levels. I think we are reasonably stable in our research staffing levels. We might have one or two relatively minor initiatives which would represent single digit percentage in research staff in order to pursue a few new initiatives. We out of our 2011 we might become a little bit more aggressive with some software development initiatives, but we are by and large fairly comfortable where we are right now and there is some big trends towards some cost efficiencies as we get rid of these multiple facilities. They kind of (inaudible) any mentions as before we are training process in the 10 to 20 range that we happen to be at the end of the quarter and actually as we moved, we actually pushed the training class into the next quarter so that’s why you saw that dip a little bit. So I think you will see that go back up and we will see that continue to be around the 200 plus and minus a little bit pretty consistently moving forward.
Tim Connor - William Blair & Company: Okay, thanks and then one final one. analytics programs, PPR integration and putting that on top of the data base. Just could you discuss this generally what the plans are for that going forward.
Andrew Florance: Sure, some day I want to be more like and only talk about new products when I am on the stage when we actually them shipping tomorrow. But its going well again getting everyone under roof in Boston is great because you have got a great technology team over a result, you got a very innovative group with PPR and then put under one facility its much easier to work on a integrations so we are pursuing a deeply integrated set of products between everything we re doing. From compass to portfolio maximize or to request to DCF to analytics and forecasting and in property data we envision something that is tightly integrated one interface for the customer, one looking field, one login and that's we're going to be pursuing and we're probably not going to give a lot of color on specifically what we're doing until we actually are delivering the product to our clients. (inaudible) had a reasons.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jim Wilson, JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.
James Wilson - JPMorgan Securities: Andy I was wondering if you could give little more color on deal mainly what -- at anyone tell a dollar amount probably but what change and what was added from the last contract you had with them?
Andrew Florance: This is actually wells real I think wells trying I believe there is a client but the one it was specifically mentioned it was wells real estate and that we're just been that was has been a new customer acquisition that would be something where they would have been I believe using a different competing service for their analytics information, their market forecast and when they looked at being able to get the highly granular detail that a CoStar provides coupled with the great market analytics in the right hubs and forecasting the PPR provides, they thought that was a more effective solution so they basically our new (inaudible) for us.
James Wilson - JPMorgan Securities: Okay, I see. All right and then maybe other one would be you working to both cross sale the analytics and then what you will produce on the combine desktop, so do you maybe the traveler little are highlight the coupled two, three main things that customers tells you about this is what we really want from you, can you do this, will you do this or when will you be able to do this?
Andrew Florance: Okay so I think two things lets focus on three things. One is the customer who is attending our PPR conference in the Cape and getting high level overviews of forecast and vacancy rates and run rates and discussions which metrics to be investing in commercial real estate. One will be able to access that information and online they customize that information very high level analytics on macro. Macro trends in US commercial real estate but they want to be able to go from there down to the asset level and see what’s actually happening in specific assets and these people have assets, they like to look and have directly competing assets and performing compared to their assets and they want that all be in a same system with their macro economies resize and they want to be able to go back and forth between the two. The other thing is they want to get too more granular economic, analytics and economic forecast. They want to be able to get a very specific analytics and breakouts on how one submarket and micro market is likely to perform compared to another macro market so its not good enough to talk about what’s happening in office space and mid-town Manhattan you need to be talking about what’s happening in the Plaza district distinctly different from what’s happening in the Grand Central area. So getting into greater granular and that’s part of our initiatives but economist in each local market and really get into the detail there. We think there is a huge market there, there are more than a 100, 200, 300 developers and owners who have multi-billion dollar portfolios only at the local level and that appeals to them in particular. The other thing I think is very interesting is being able to take the customers information, the customers have a wealth of information about their portfolios from accounting information to lease management systems to forecasting systems being able to take that information help them organize it but then present and mind the relevant information in our database analytics and forecast and set against what's relevant and important to them based upon their data and help them soar through this billions of piece of data to find out which ten pieces of data is important to them. So those are the three big trends are going out. We are having a blast doing it’s a fun project. It’s very ambitious but that’s what the customers are saying and we are very happy to pursue solution that sort of matches with the customers are asking for I guess we are nerds.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ramon, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is (inaudible) for Chris. Can you talk about what excess capacity you install basis clients might have currently in terms of a new subscription ID and how that may impact an incremental spend with an outline basis towards the recovery?
Andrew Florance: Certainly like the CoStar shadow vacancy rate or something. It’s actually relatively low, our sales force is compensated fairly heavily and we actually shifted our compensation structure at the beginning of the downturn to centralize our sales force to proactively pursue inactive user ids and try to make them active. We call it going creating green bar users, so, in our internal tracking system if you are using our product heavily you are green user. They have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions of dollars in commissions over the last two years. Going after these dormant ids these people have the legal or subscribers but don’t our product and getting them to use the product, so we are probably when the history of our company at one of the better places we have ever been in terms of having these high percentage of user ids active. And then actually the sales people actually get a loose commissions on new sales as they have a high ratio of dormant ids. So they are right on top of it and the positive evidence of that effort is the fact that these new customers, these customers that have been our customers less then five years right now, they jumped from 74% renewal rate to 87% in the course of one year and that’s because we chased down the dormant ideas. So, I think our company is in the strongest place it’s ever been in terms of percentage of active user ids.
Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, and just as a clarification if there is a headcount reduction at any of your book or client does that id go away or are they still paying for it and they might have a lot backlog of that which they might need to use before they start buying new ids from start?
Andrew Florance : Well, that was really a sort of story from last year and the year before when people were reducing brokerage headcount. So, as we went into the downturn like third quarter '07, '08, '09 (inaudible) reducing headcount there were many disruptions were actually probably little bit authorize a lot meant, so there was a lot of recall it and right downs in '08 and '09 associated with down side and then it's the right number by these I don't expect that could be a major factor going forward, I think we're now moving into an expansion phase in brokerage and I think that we're probably as I understand from our sales management team we're seeing a lot of seat adds right now, to now lot of see reductions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington, Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: Good morning. Question for you on adjusted EBITDA margins, and you saw some improvement quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year there and time-to-time the number of 30% achievable target is come up and the question for you that, how should we think about that margin going forward, what kind of the timeframe should we have for getting toward 30% type number and how should we think about the incremental operating margin between now and there?
Brian Radecki: Sure. Hi, Bill, it's Brian. I think that we obviously giving guidance on next year this call, but I think we're very, very well positioned to see expansion in that number. I think, I kind of point people back to the 2007 (inaudible) to the end of the third quarter 2008 time period which that time period was great after we completed a major expansion in pretty much every quarter you saw revenue drop from the top line to the bottom line, sometimes at 50% sometimes at 79% sometimes at 100% so I think we are staring to move back into that phase, we have had a lot of things we have done this year with the acquisition of PPR reserves, the integration of those businesses they are moving in the headquarters. We saw some of that noise coming through in the fourth quarter maybe at just the (inaudible) in the first quarter by believing as you certainly get to the middle of next year, the end of next year I think you will see that number expand and I think it will look a lot more similar to that 2007-2008 time period I think if we continue at the rates that we are at, we can get through a 30% margin, I believe fairly quickly and I guess at this point everybody back to hat time period and you can see the figured out based on your own revenue growth projections
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: Alright the other question for you how the acquisition pipeline is looking?
Brian Radecki: The acquisition pipeline is robust there are a number of potential things out there that we are any given time dialoguing with half a dozen different companies and there is no lack of potential deals out there. I think we are realistically – the consolidation of the headquarters, all the Boston office, result PPR as capital busy as (inaudible) software planning so probably we are moving into a season with little bit of accelerated operation like (inaudible)
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: Okay. And I wanted to also ask about that -- what you think that shiny new building is worth today versus what you paid for it. And whether you had any plans to unlock that value.
Brian Radecki: Yeah its always difficult much you actually have a transaction you don’t really expecting [waving] I guess we paid [41.2], $230 per sq foot it does not, its got a long term land lease out of the property there has been a trends towards institutional investor really wanting to find yield that may look at class A Asset and first year cities as being good alternatives to low yielding debt instrument, cause its pretty much taken up a bond from a company back by high quality real estate so we seen some deals we picked up (inaudible) 230 something a foot 240 something a foot we seen some deals within a couple of blocks of here in the 600, 700 range we are not long term investors in commercial real estate we provide services people who do that so we are always open to, unlocking the value in that and deploying the capital in other probably other users are more core to our business, so was that a good non answer.
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: I think it’s at least worth of a couple of bucks, (inaudible) tax, but anyway thank you very much
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Toni Kathryn] from Morgan Stanley please go ahead
Toni Kathryn - Morgan Stanley: Hi guys thanks for taking my question, just a quick question on your traction in the retail marketing how it’s progressing and the initiate you have to sort up the customer base in that market, thanks a lot
Andrew Florance: Thank you for question Tony we have had some good traction so we now have a lot recognizable retailers as customer using our services for above evaluating their properties and also opening new store we now have I believe in the relatively short period that we have been in retail information and I believe we have 10 of the top 10 retail, nine of the top 10 retail owner developers now as customers so that’s been very successful. To be honest with you I think we are overdue for some product enhancements and upgrades so we have been extraordinarily successful on this space. We have been successful in gaining the trust of the industry and they are using our platform to communicate their offerings listings properties for sale and they are doing it and I guess we've seen multi 100% growth in the number of listings moving through our system. So I think we are at the early stages of developing a product for the retail community and as we get to version two, three and four I think we will be able to get some really solid growth in that space. So, we want to get to next year's ICSC where I think some product upgrades responsible what we know about the industry what we can do for them. I mean these are not really expensive upgrades by the way I should say, this is not involved hiring hundreds of people involves couple of software developers.
Operator: Speaking of this time we have no further questions in queue.
Andrew Florance: Okay. And just wanted to thank you all for joining us for the third quarter call and we look forward to I guess next call of the year end results numbers and we are really glad to be in a strong market with some attraction sales and we hope all the other earnings call goes well. Thank you.

You can find a webcast of this conference call on our website at www.costar.com/corporate/investor. Thank you for joining us. I will now turn the call over to Andy Florence.
Andrew Florance: Thank you Tim, and welcome everyone to CoStar Group's second quarter 2010 conference call. This is the first quarterly conference call we are making from our new headquarters building at 1331 L Street in Downtown, Washington DC. I am very pleased to report that the continued signs of stabilization in the commercial real state economy, CoStar group can report accelerating revenue growth and climbing renewal rates. Our sales bookings doubled quarter-over-quarter and our in-quarter renewal rate climbed to a very impressive annualized rate of approximately 92%. We posted another consecutive quarterly revenue record of $55.8 million, which is an increase of $5.7 million over second quarter 2009 revenues of $50.1 million. The company added $11.6 million in cash to the balance sheet during the second quarter. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand now totaled $230 million and the company continues to have no long term debt or mortgage debt because of 94% of CoStar revenues is subscription based and because we have historically higher renewal rates in the 90% plus range, we believe that CoStar group is not a highly cyclical business and it is generally a bit more defensive. Despite that fact, history shows that CoStar's revenues have grown dramatically faster during a stronger commercial real estate market than in a declining one. For that reason I would like to begin today's conference call by sharing with you in more detail some important and positive indication we continue to see emerging in the commercial real estate economy. Perhaps the most significant recent development is that office vacancies rates have stopped climbing and appeared now to have stabilized. After having experienced one of the most dramatic losses in US jobs since World War II. Job losses appear to have bottomed out and we are beginning to see consistent job growth. In the last eight recessions, we have had since World War II the rate of job recovery has been roughly symmetrical to that of job losses. Economy.com is forecasting strong job growth over the next several years. Of there were the case it would indicate the potential for a strong commercial real estate recovery over these next several years as well. The US had already experienced three consecutive quarters of office using job growth for a total gain of 200,000 jobs. I believe that the strong year-over-year overall growth in corporate profits we are seeing is a good leading indicator for continued job growth. Important leading indicators such as temporary employment and weekly hours worked are also showing a continued positive trend. All economic lows in Greece are still threatening. I find it useful to keep in perspective that of the size of Greece is an economy of smaller [than so] obvious. The nature of job losses in this recession was somewhat unique. This time around the extensive job losses did not result in a very large amount of negative [vast] absorption. In the dot com bust, the job losses came from a smaller number of companies that eliminate most if not all of their staffs. Those sorts of job losses resulted in immediate and concentrated negative absorption of office space.  This time around the job, crests were spread more broadly across many companies. Many of which reduced their stats by 10% to 15% across the board. Companies that cut 10% of their staff typically do not immediately put excess office space back into the market, so this mitigates the scale of a negative absorption. And as rents have fallen over the past several years, many tenants may simply retain this less expensive excess office space. The bottom line is that less space has come flooding back into the markets than most experts expected.  We have seen solid leasing activity levels over the past four quarters and that trend continued in the second quarter of this year, as we recorded 6 million square feet of positive net absorption of US office space during the quarter. This is very good news for our core customers as leasing commissions are a major source of their revenue. In 2009, 15 of the top 20 largest US cities suffered negative absorption of office space. But year-to-date in 2010, only 9 of top 20 say have measured any discernible negative absorption. Office leasing and absorption are recovering. Commercial real estate constructions levels in the US are stunningly low right now. Due to falling rents, declining values and increasing the fall to an incredibly tight credit, new deliveries are at their lowest levels post World War II. In fact, we believe that the amount of commercial real estate being built is less than the physical deterioration rate of commercial buildings resulting in a net effective contraction of commercial inventory in the US. Commercial credit markets remain very tight with stringent underwriting and large equity investment requirements in the part of borrowers. Most banks and traditional lenders have reduced their exposure to commercial real estate and CMBS mortgages continue to show increasing rates as default. With the current financing constraints, we are not likely to see an increase in commercial construction starts in the near future. Taken together, positive net absorptions, the absence of new supply means that for the first time in year's office vacancy rates have stabilized and they are virtually flat. Last year, vacancy rates were climbing by as much as 50 basis points per quarter, but in the second quarter of this year they barely moved 3 basis points. In fact, fully half of the top 20 US markets saw vacancy rates decline during the second quarter. I believe that we have now seen the bottom of supply-demand imbalance in the office market. The recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported that office vacancy rates were still climbing. This article relied on a source that has a tiny fraction of the research resource that CoStar has. We believe that the source has somewhere around 120th, the number of people conducting research that CoStar has and we don't believe they have a credible way of measuring actual absorption reliably. Therefore, they could only model it. I think the source guessed wrong in its assessment and particularly about job growth impacting negative absorption. And as a result the article provided a terribly misleading account of the state of the industry to Wall Street. I believe it's a much more accurate and research backed assessments that commercial real estate industry is showing obvious signs of initial recovery. Rental rates are even beginning to stabilize. In fact if the job growth that economy.com projects materializes and the construction levels stay as low as we believe, we have every reason to expect this recovery to continue and in fact, we might see rapidly falling vacancy rates within the next three years in some markets. This in turn would be expected to lead the rapid recovery and rents in many office markets. The nearly complete withdrawal of CMBS as a debt source for commercial real estate still has the capital markets nearly paralyzed, or the debt markets. Values remain down but they are no longer falling, and in fact they've began to move back up slightly. If vacancy rates do fall causing ramps and eventually and a rise to climb, then this refinancing landmine that many analysts have feared may never fully materialize. Since equity investors would likely be eager to take out the debt. At the recent ICSC convention, it seemed that hundreds of perspective real estate buyers came by our booth, looking for ways to find distressed properties. There appears to be so much pent up investor interest targeting distressed property that any property labeled distressed that hits the market, attracts multiple bids and often ends up selling for a not so distressed price, especially in those primary markets currently favored by the investors. In fact, we are seeing prices for some recent Washington DC office sales hit the $800 per square foot mark again. I think the market is flooded with buyers, even distressed buyers, then perhaps sellers may have some reason to be optimistic. The bottom line is that we are increasingly but guardedly optimistic that we maybe coming out of the worst of this commercial real estate downturn. We believe that this is great news for our revenue growth prospects over the next several years. In light of these indications of recovery, for the first time in years we have begun to reinstate modest price increases, just slightly above inflation. With the benefit of an improving commercial real estate market and a larger more experienced sales force, our sales showed good results in the second quarter. In addition to generating very high customer renewal rates, quarterly bookings more than doubled company-wide as I've mentioned. Annualized net new bookings were positive for the third consecutive quarter. The total for the second quarter was $3.7 million that more than doubled, the first quarter bookings totaled approximately $1.6 million. The biggest driver of our strengthening organic revenue growth this quarter was our US flagship CoStar Property Professional through information service. So our strengthening revenue growth is coming from our core product and that's somewhat equal across the regions of the country. The in-quarter renewal rate for annual subscription based services jumped to approximately 92% during the second quarter from approximately 87% in the first quarter of 2010. The twelve month trailing renewal rate also increased during the second quarter to approximately 88% from approximately 86% in the first quarter of 2010. As I've described in previous calls, we have made a concerted effort throughout the recession to retain the business of our customers with a particular focus on our new customers. We restructured the commission rates of our sales force to focus on driving early usage and accelerate adoption of our products at new customer sites. We believe this effort was very successful as the renewal rate for firms that have been clients for less than five years increased from approximately 74% in the second quarter of 2009 to approximately 88% in the second quarter of 2010. Our renewal rate for clients that have been customers for five years or more climbed to approximately 97% in the second quarter, 97%. When you consider this renewal rate, figure does not exclude clients that cancel for bankruptcy or unfortunately even death. This number is phenomenal. Clearly, sales conditions for our services are better than they were last year. With leasing activity up, commissions are up, that's the core revenue driver for our clients. We are seeing a big improvement in the financial health of our clients compared to last year. And more of them are adding users and subscribing to additional territories compared with last year. The total number of subscription clients increased to 16,200 or our subscription client's sites increased to 16,297 company-wide during the second quarter of 2010 from 15,995 in the first quarter. The total number of individual overall subscribers dipped slightly during the second quarter to a total of 86,317 from 86,590 in the first quarter. The number of individual subscribers in the US however increased during the quarter by 446. But a drop in the UK subscribers offset this number. This drop in the UK occurred for several reasons; we renewed several of our major UK clients in the second quarter that during course of last several years have reduced their headcount. In the United Kingdom, it's much more likely that the brokers or surveyors are salary-based unlike the US where they are commission-based. This puts more pressure on the surveyors or brokers in the United Kingdom to cut headcount during a downturn, and this doesn't happen the same way in the US. So, when these firms are renewed, they did sell at lower subscriber numbers. Secondly, during the second quarter, the UK sales force devoted a very significant percentage of it's time and effort to launching our Showcase product in the UK. I believe their efforts have been very successful, but they predominantly targeted existing clients so as they sign these people up, these sales do not result in net new subscriber growth. As I indicated last call, our first quarter average contract value reflected an unusually big sales quarter or high ticket sales quarter for PPR. Those sales of PPR were nearly double the typical quarterly average. So, the overall second quarter average contract value fell the $7,031 reflecting the return to more normalized sales for PPR during the quarter. It also reflects a large number of sales made to new customers who tend to be small to mid-size firms. In fact the second quarter saw the highest total sales to new customers for the second quarter of 2007. While these smaller to mid-size firms tend to sign contracts at lower price points, we believe they present excellent upsell opportunities. During the second quarter, we introduced a new bundling of our US products targeting small firms. Essentially, this packaging consists of elements of our popular flagship information products together with Showcase as being offered in certain secondary and tertiary markets. Like Showcase, it is available on individual subscription basis and an affordable rate. Excluding these agreements, we signed the 570 new agreements during the second quarter with an averaged annualized contract buy of $8,141. As we had previously mentioned on our calls, we had previously invested in growing our sales force ahead of the expected recovery. At the end of the second quarter we had a total of 194 sales reps, slightly less than 203 on staff at the end of the first quarter. This includes 126 US subscription sales reps, 7 US advertising sales reps, 38 in-house sales reps, 19 UK field sales reps and 4 sales reps for PPR and Resolve. Overall, I'm very encouraged by the strengthening positive trends we've seen in our sales activity over the first half this year. We certainly realize and expect that we'll likely see up and down the sales months during a transition year, but we remain very optimistic, we will see continuing positive sales performance overall for the rest of 2010. Accordingly, we are revising our guidance upward for the year and Brian will explain that shortly. I do want to take a moment to highlight a particular benchmark of success for our retail real estate product offerings. We have now signed up as clients, 9 of the 10 largest retail property owners in the US as ranked by Retail Traffic Magazine.  In addition, during the quarter we continue to sign up major retailers to the CoStar service, such as Denny's, Taco Bell, Dollar Tree and a very major coffee retailer we cannot disclose. I believe that the tremendous growth of our retail database over the past five years allow us to offer dramatically better retail property information today. Thanks to our research team, CoStar now tracks more retail properties than any other information provider. Today we have nearly 600,000 for lease and for sale retail listings in our database, with approximately 1.4 million US retail properties. With the increase in the size and value of our retail database, CoStar is becoming more of a household name in the retail industry and we expect to see many more sales from the retail sector which I believe offers tremendous growth potential for our services. Our Showcase online marketing service reached an important milestone during the second quarter by exceeding 10,000 subscribers in just a little more than two years after our initial US launch. We definitely have to congratulate our sales force for that accomplishment. At the end of the second quarter there were approximately 10,110 total Showcase subscribers in the US and the service is generating approximately $6 million in annualized revenue. Focusing on individual subscribers paying for internet theory advertising, we believe that we have succeeded in achieving a market share, nearly comparable with that of our major competitors in that space in a very, very short period of time. As I mentioned, we recently introduced Showcase to the United Kingdom. Since this is CoStar's first truly international software offering, this launch represents an important milestone for the company. Just as we launched Showcase in the US, many of our first UK subscribers are on trial contracts. We expect to convert a large percentage of early clients in the UK who are now on these trial contracts just as we did in the US. At this early initial point, we already have nearly 1,000 individual Showcase subscribers in the UK, 372 of which are already paying subscribers, not on trials. I would like to take a moment to also brief you on several initiatives in this past quarter. In two weeks, CoStar is releasing the industry's first comprehensive repeat sales index for commercial real estate. We believe that this is the first reliable repeat sales index for our industry. The index is expected to provide investors with the clearest and most rigorously accurate insight on price movement in commercial real estate assets. Over the past two decades, repeat sale regression analysis has become the most accepted method for analyzing and understanding price movements within markets. In part, because of the popularity established in the housing market by the Standard & Poor/Case-Shiller repeat sales index. The CoStar commercial repeat sales index is made possible because of our unique database of 1.3 million sales comparables with nearly 85,000 usable repeat sales pairs.  We've presented the methodology and model for the repeat sales index at the American Real Estate Society earlier this year in a paper lead authored by Dr. Ruijue Peng of CoStar Group and assisted by Dr. Norm Miller of CoStar Group and Dr. [Ming Zong Hong] along with myself and Dr. Karl “Chip” Case. Chip is famous as the one of the founders of the Case-Shiller Residential Real Estate Value Index and I believe with Dr. Peng as his advisor. Investors in other industries have come to value these industries providing greater transparency and insight into market dynamics. We expect to produce monthly updates on the first Thursday of each month to service timely indicators of the overall health of the commercial real estate industry. CoStar subscribers will have access to the full set of indexes which will include sub category by price level segment, property type and by region. We announced during the second quarter that we plan to develop powerful discounted cash flow theory evaluation software and ultimately introduce specialized Automated Valuation Modeling, AVMs, for commercial real estate and asset and portfolios. To direct this ambitious effort, we recently hired Jeff Wells, who joined our Resolve Technology team in Boston as Vice President. Jeff has a long and distinguished career developing and refining much of the real estate valuation software in use today. Over the course of his career he has worked with 100s of real estate clients to create software products that address a wide range of real estate investment applications. Discounted cash flow software is widely used by investors to evaluate real estate portfolios and analyze the expected future financial performance of potential real estate investments. However, the forecast and financial performance projections they make are only as accurate and useful as the daily use in their analysis and underlying assumptions. Building an update in these models is an arduous and expensive task, but very, very important. We see an opportunity to take advantage of our unique extensive research based data, analytical expertise and software development resources resulting from the combination of CoStar, PPR and Resolve to provide automated, easier to use discounted cash flow forecasting and valuation capabilities. Our primary goal is to produce tools that make our research and analytics even more viable to current and prospective clients.  PPR continued to see strong demand for its analytic and forecasting services during the quarter, both from its own client base and in cross-selling opportunities with CoStar's existing clients. We signed $0.5 million in cross-sale contracts during the second quarter of 2010. With its continued strong sales performance, PPR remains ahead of year-to-date plan. We also continue to benefit from the growing recognition in the market of the value of the combination of CoStar and PPR. Several new clients say their combinations as a determining factor in this selection of an information provider. During the first two quarters of this year, CoStar's research team continued to expand our database adding more than 64,000 listings net and approximately 173,000 properties and approximately 865,000 new digital images. We now have more than 3.7 million properties in our database. We believe that our impressive database grip corresponds to long term potential revenue growth and creates increasingly high bearers to entry. Let me close my remarks by saying that I am very pleased with our company's performance over the first half of this year. Increasing sales, higher renewal rates and solid revenue growth clearly demonstrate renewed strength in our business. Based on our outlook, we fully expect to continue to achieve high margin revenue growth as the economic recovery strengthens in the second half of this year and continuing into 2011. At this point, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Brian Radecki.
Brian Radecki : Great. Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we are very pleased with our second quarter 2010 results. We achieved directed revenues for the third consecutive quarter and saw positive momentum continue in many, many areas of the business. Today, I am going to focus principally on sequential results for the second quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter 2010 and also on our outlook for the third quarter in full year. We believe sequential trends offer the most insight into the performance of our business as they continue to progress through the current economic and commercial real estate cycle. Our second quarter revenues came in stronger than anticipated at $55.8 million, an increase of $700,000 over the first quarter and an increase of 5.7 million compared to revenues of $50.1 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our record revenue performance during the quarter was driven by strong organic company-wide net new subscription sales, and as Andy mentioned, based on the core CoStar suite. Subscription revenue for the second quarter accounted for 94.1% of total revenues. And on functional currency basis, international revenues was approximately 3.1 million pounds, essentially flat with compared to the first quarter of 2010. International revenues were approximately 8.3% of the company's total revenues in the second quarter. As of June 30, 2010, our 12 month trailing renewal rate which is a measure of renewing subscription revenue was approximately 88%. We are thrilled to see our 12 month trailing renewal rate move back towards our historical average of approximately 90%, as our customer retention efforts and company-wide contract bookings continue to improve.  As I have publicly stated for at least two years now, we had expected our trailing 12 months renewal to decrease in the mid-80s during the downturn last year and then begin to recover in 2010. Currently at the midpoint of the year, I'm pleased to report that our renewal rates are turning ahead of expectations as demand for CoStar services has been strong and we expect to continue to see our renewal rates remain strong for the remainder of 2010. Please note that the renewal rate which is total dollars renewing in the quarter will fluctuate from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter for the trends an overall level on a 12 month basis are important. Just remember moving from the low 80s to the high 80s and eventually in the 90s all within a year is extremely positive news. Now turning to gross margin. Gross margin was $35.5 million in Q2 of 2010. It was up approximately $1.6 million compared to Q1 of 2010. Gross margin percentage increased from 63.5 to 61.5 in Q1 of 2010 due to higher revenue and lower research costs which mainly resulted from timing differences between Q1 and Q2. Also, Q2's gross margin includes a full impact of PPR Resolve and investments in research when you compare the last year, as we have discussed on previous calls.  Moving down the income statement, total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were $31 million, compared to $28.8 million for the first quarter of 2010, which mainly reflects the $2.8 million in one time accruals for illegal settlements. As stated in the press release last night, CoStar reached favorable preliminary settlements on two legal matters in the second quarter that will avoid potentially years of additional litigation. In connection with these anticipated settlements, the company accrued $2.8 million as one time cost in our second quarter general administrative expenses.  Specifically the company accrued $2 million in anticipation of resolving a dispute with its former landlord in the UK, Nokia, concerning the company's termination of a lease agreement for its former London office. The company's decision to terminate the agreement to lease with Nokia back in 2009, and subsequently sign a new lease for our London office located in the West end, was one of the series of moves made as a part of our overall strategy to consolidate our London offices and substantially reduce our long-term occupancy costs. We also accrued approximately $800,000 in anticipation of assailment of payments that will resolve a class action law suits filed in California alleging violation of wage in hour loss. The company vigorously denies any wrongdoing and believes this settlement to be in the best interest of the shareholders. We can't go into much more detail than I just described on the settlement, but needless to say we are pleased to put it behind us. Looking at profitability, net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $3.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share and our non-GAAP net income was $6.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share. These results reflect both the recognition of our one time discreet tax benefit and our clue of the legal settlements which mainly relate to our UK operations. If you “normalize” the second quarter by taking out both of these items, we came in well above our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance ranges. If you are evaluating the core operations of the business, it's important to adjust for both of these items since neither were factored in the analyst models and they belong together. If you only adjust for one or the other, they will come up with a strange result that does not really reflect how the business performed. Quite simply we were very happy with the results on both the GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, basically due to stronger operating results. Non-GAAP EPS was slightly above our previous guidance range due to the higher than expected revenue in small shifts and some operating expenses that do not occur in Q2, that we expect to occur later in the year. HQ transition costs added back to non-GAAP earnings of approximately $1 million came in slightly higher than expected largely due to timing between the quarters. We still expect those costs to be in the range of $3 million to $3.3 million for the year, which is slightly lower than we originally expected.  Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2010 was $13.3 million, an increase of $2.5 million to the adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. EBITDA of $7.8 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $8.8 million in the first quarter. As I described earlier, the second quarter included a $2.8 million accrual for the anticipated government and legal matters. Reconciliation of all our non-GAAP net income EBITDA and non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the GAAP basis results are shown in detail along with definition of those terms in our press release issued yesterday which is available on our website at www.costar.com. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter 2010 with approximately $230 million in cash, cash equivalent and investments; a $11.6 million increase from March 31, 2010, obviously driven by a strong cash flow from operations. The company has no long term debt. Our cash increase was positively impacted by improved accounts receivable collections, improved DSOs which also translate into lower bad debt expense on the income statement. Clearly, the health of our clients continues to strengthen quarter-over-quarter. As a result, our collection cycles continue to shorten, accounts receivable balance as of 12/30/2010 is at its lowest point since 2007. Also, a couple other items to note on the balance sheet are that prepaid and other assets which increased by $2.5 million from the end of the 2009 to the first quarter of 2010 was due to the fact that we prepaid our corporate taxes and that has now declined by approximately $3 million which again mainly relates to our corporate tax payments. Contrary to any negative speculation, the company has not capitalized any software development or other costs and put them in prepaids. If the company is required to capitalize software development costs at any point, it would properly classify them in intangibles and other assets and a specific detail would be listed in the notes of the financial statements in our 10-Q. If you would like to look at an example of how CoStar does this, pull out our reports any time from 2000-2004. We haven't done it in years. Thank you. We will now speak to our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2010. Our guidance takes into account recent revenue growth rate trends and our results may be impacted by the economic conditions in commercial real estate or the global economy.  Our forward-looking guidance reflects our current expectations as of July 22nd, 2010. We expect revenue for the third quarter of 2010 in the range of $55.8 million to $56.5 million for the full, and for the full year we are raising the high end of our annual guidance range by $2 million to approximately $22.5 million to $224 million. Continued strong demand for services, demonstrates of our 12 month trailing renewal rate moving back towards our 90% historical average, combined with their consistent revenue growth on the first two quarters gives us a lot of confidence in our higher annual revenue outlook.  Our guidance on the impact for foreign exchange fluctuations on the top line results remains consistent. Do not attempt to predict foreign exchange rate fluctuations and our guidance assumes little to no volatility from the current rate. The average exchange rate in second quarter was up US$1.49 to 1 British pound and our 2010 guidance assumes a rate of 1.45 for the remainder of the year. As discussed earlier, the company's income tax expense decreased in the second quarter due to recognition of a one-time discreet tax benefit related to the UK operations. We continue to expect the annual tax rate for 2010 to be up approximately 44%. Therefore our third and fourth quarter rate will be slightly higher at approximately 49%. That said, any acquisitions or large one-time gains or losses would affect the tax rate in any point. In terms of earnings, we expect our third quarter 2010 fully diluted net income per share of approximately $0.13 to $0.15 and non-GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.29 to $0.33. Our third quarter outlook for GAAP net income per diluted share includes $1.3 million to $1.5 million of costs related to the transition to our new corporate headquarters in Washington DC. Approximately $1 million to $1.3 million for restructuring and consolidation of our three Boston offices, for CoStar, PPR and Resolve into one single location is approximately $1.8 million to $1.9 million in equity compensation charges. For the full year 2010, we expect GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.58 to $0.63 in non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $1.17 to $1.25. We expect to achieve our earnings outlook even with the short term dilution to net income resulting from the legal settlements and ongoing efforts to reduce our long term facilities cost by moving our headquarters into a corporate-owned facility and by consolidating offices in Boston and the United Kingdom. For our annual guidance range, we essentially adjusted the $2.8 million accrued for the settlements which was partially offset by the higher expected revenue we now have. On an annual basis, our expected tax rate is still approximately 44% which is what we have expected all year, therefore it only impacts the fluctuations between the quarters for the discreet item and has no effect on the annual guidance range. In addition for the full year 2010, we expect approximately $3 million to $3.2 million of costs related to the transition to our new corporate facilities, approximately $1.1 million to $1.4 million in restructuring lease charges and $8.3 million to $8.5 million of equity compensation expenses. The costs in 2010 related to the acquisition and transition of our corporate headquarters in Washington DC are expected to primarily include overlapping occupancy costs to the end of the current lease term and carrying costs associated with new building. The current headquarters office lease expired on October 15th, 2010. While we have already begun to move certain employees to the new building, we do not intend to complete the move to the headquarters until October. After this period, we expect to save approximately $2 million a year in occupancy costs for our headquarters beginning in 2011. Once we get passed these transition costs this year, which the majority are in the second and third quarter, we believe we have created significant long term value by reducing long term cost structures for the foreseeable future. In closing, we are very pleased with our record second quarter revenue results and momentum we are seeing in the business. Our business model remains strong and the fact that we have 94% subscription-based business model with high renewal rates, the unique proprietary database, market leading position, strong balance sheet, no debt and very high operating cash flow. We expect to return to more normalized organic revenue growth rates and expanding margins as we've enjoyed over the past decade in the very near future and we are well on our way. CoStar's management team believes there is significant opportunity for additional high margin revenue growth on the investments that we have made. We remain focused on our long term goal of growing CoStar's business towards $1 billion of revenue in high margin. We expect and continue to report that progress to you, and with that, I open up the call for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) One moment for the first question. And we'll go to the line of Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: I think you said that Showcase platform was, you are earning about $6 million in annualized revenues, could you just give us what the in-quarter contribution was from Showcase or I guess the second quarter and also the first quarter?
Andrew Florance: Through our revenue or contribution margin?
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Yeah. The quarterly revenue contribution from Showcase, you gave annualized numbers. 
Brian Radecki: Yeah. We are not giving our quarterly numbers but annualized. It's approximately $6 million and obviously it's only been operating 18 months, so that's been growing each quarter.
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: You think growing towards that shouldn't be, we shouldn't assume that it's sort of 1.5 per quarter? 
Brian Radecki: Yeah, it would assume that you are obviously at 1.5 or higher right now. That's correct.
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then similarly, I think you said that PPR was a bit ahead of plan. Is PPR the main source of the higher revenue guidance or is it a combination of things, could you maybe give us some more color there?
Brian Radecki: As we mentioned, the core acceleration is occurring in our traditional flagship products. So, close to our property professional. So it's basically reflecting economic recovery.
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: I guess you would characterize your higher revenue guidance as coming from no combination of the core and acquired or is it sort of weighted more one towards the other?
Andrew Florance: I think Chris, if you look at it, again the suite of service property constant tenant that we sell was a major driver this quarter, with PPR also continuing to drive, but again PPR is 10% of the business and UK is 8% of the business. So, again the 80% of the growth is coming from the core platform which is very positive, all subscriptions annual subscription contracts so it's very good high quality revenue. 
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank:  Okay. And then, the in-quarter renewal rate looked pretty good. How high should we think that that number could get? 
Andrew Florance: Wasn't it beautiful?
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: 92%. I mean I know that your trailing renewal rate I think has topped out of sort of the 93-94% level in the past. Yeah, give us a sense for like how high we think, we can think of the in-quarter and also maybe where you think the last whole month renewal rate is heading as well?
Andrew Florance: I think it's definitely an impressive testament to the utility of the nature of the products, but we are very stringent on how to calculate that number. So, we've got a lot of clients who are small partnerships and if a partner passes away and the business is dissolved, that counts as a non-renewal or if someone retires or of someone goes bankrupt. So, there is only so high you can go unless your clients have life expectancy of say several hundred years. So, I think it maxes out that sort of historical level of 93%, 94%, and that 97% number, the five plus, is really quite phenomenal.
Brian Radecki: And Chris, I talked about that, I mean renewal rates can't continue to go up every single quarter. I do think that when you look at where we were in the 2005, 2006, 2007 we were always over 90% each quarter in the maxing out of the 93%, 94%. So, I think that the trailing 12 month is going to go up and I've said this pretty openly into high 80s, the closing the year in the high 80s and I believe we can get up into the 90s on the trialing 12 months into next year, which means you would quarters obviously continuing to post a 90 plus, between the 90% and 94%. But it will fluctuate a little bit in between quarters.
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And is there way to get that rate, sort of what the renewal rate would be X to the Showcase platform?
Andrew Florance: The Showcase platform is spilt into two pieces, so one piece is subscription-based service for Showcase to firms and then there is the monthly individuals that go on and off each month. We do not count the monthly individuals. The renewal rate is on the 94% of the business as subscription-based services that would include those firms on a annual contract for Showcase. It's not the 6% of the business which we don't consider subscription based or somebody who would be on a monthly tenant, half of that is not.  
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: It's advertising type…
Brian Radecki:  Correct. That's right. It's the renewal rate for subscription based services.
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Right. So it's only a portion of the Showcase platform?
Brian Radecki: That's correct.
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: It is a portion that is subscription-based in the Showcase. Is that helping to bolster the overall subscription rate? I mean is that one of the success stories that you would say to why the renewal rates have improved? 
Andrew Florance: The core driver of the strength of businesses are traditional CoStar properties, CoStar comps, CoStar tenant, these products are, you know just real solid utility staples in the industry and as our clients are seeing some release on some cash flow, we are enjoying that benefit. So it's really about the core of the business. 
Chris Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Okay. I guess and my last question. In fact, first of my questions, I appreciate you taking them. Why did the sales headcount drop sequentially? 
Andrew Florance: It's not material, what is a 2%, it's just a fluctuation, if someone went to graduate school, somebody got married. We moved offices, so we didn't have a training class, so it's not really a material. In general, Chris, we expect that sales number to be sort of in that range and it's not, it's at this quarter and in the first quarter, you know, for the foreseeable future. We are not anticipating on that number going up or down by 50, it's going to stay pretty much in sort of that range. It's a good healthy number.
Operator: You will go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: My first question, I want to make sure I am getting the EPS guidance right. I'll tell you what I think the math is, but then please correct me. You start out the original guidance, then you got to ding the number by what I am assuming is $2.8 million tax affected and divided by the share count and then you have to add back something in order to get to your new guidance, and I think that's about $0.06. Is that the right math to think about it?
Brian Radecki: Yeah, I mean for the quarter basically what you do is you essentially $2.8 million and you multiply it by the 44% tax rate versus the 30% and also to tell you, excluding those two items that we are well above the range for both GAAP and non-GAAP. And then for the year, the trick there is that the tax rate really will still essentially be the same for the year. So that $2.8 million is really what's sort of reducing the annual guidance range because the tax rate is really only a fluctuation between quarters.  And of course, if you put $2.8 million and a 44% tax rate, you get more than the $0.02 we move the range and you get a lot more than that. Obviously, we are projecting some little upside on the revenue from what we originally projected. So we are sort of offsetting some of that. So again, I think the quarterly numbers are great, and I think that up in their revenue and then even the guidance range coming in where we are going to decide to take that sort of $2.8 million charges is very positive.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: And sort of a follow-up question of that is, clearly revenue is getting better, but profitability is also getting better. What is the driver of that? Is it tight costs or is it reduction of expense on Resolve or can you give us a sense of what the drivers are?
Brian Radecki: No, we haven't reduced any expenses and as I talked about in the annual guidance in the beginning of the year, we actually will be investing in Resolve and the DCF and some of the things that we have been talking about. There are fluctuations in between quarters, there is a lot of noise going on moving the building, so I talked little bit about some costs that are shifting from first quarter to second quarter, some from the second quarter to the third quarter, but in general if you take out all those one-time items, the cost structure is essentially sort of flat this year and now we are starting to grow revenues. So that's why you are seeing improved earnings. It's the simple business model that people are seeing from the company for years. And it's important to remember, the investment activities here are pretty significant. So, we've invested into building that sales force ahead of that market turn. We are investing in several different software initiatives. We scaled the research team to make sure we maintain super high quality in the middle of this downturn. We did not get the research organization which would have been an easy thing to do. We grew the research organization which resulted in that 97% renewal rate. And then the other thing we are doing here which I'm sure someone will come with a creative writing exercise to make it like negative.  But what we are doing on the real estate side is, in the United Kingdom I believe we've saved ourselves somewhere around $10 billion in real estate occupancy costs over a five year period by our research to Glasgow, consolidating several different offices together in London, and then by consolidating some operations into our headquarters building in Washington, while we are taking a hit for it now, ultimately it will be much more cost effective. In Boston, the consolidation of real estate is expensive these quarters, and it doesn't have a real big bang cost savings, but it's critical to operations as we bring together Resolve, CoStar and PPR in Boston. So, I think that we are over a 24 month period. We've got a number of good cost control initiatives that are playing out here. They certainly don't work in our favor this quarter.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: That's helpful. And then on the CoStar, the new CoStar product that you mentioned targeted the secondary and tertiary markets. Can you remind us or give us a sense of; I am assuming it's the 50 or 60 expansion in markets primarily that have been three or four ago. Was that the right target to think of?
Andrew Florance: It's actually probably about 200 markets. And it's a decent size opportunity; it's tens of thousands of these very small firms across the country that we have not historically pursued as aggressively just because we've spent a lot of time flying field sales people out to Lubbock, Texas, and nothing against Lubbock, Texas. So, this is a way to do it, through telesales and keep our cost of sales low, and it's doing quite well. In the first month or so, you know, we sold well over a 100 units. This way I think we will be able to get some good traction here. 
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: And last question related to that. Of those markets I do think probably a good number of them are, at least partial overlapped with the markets that you expanded into during your last investment phase. Can you characterize the revenue percentage of those “small markets” however you want to define it, both on a revenue and maybe a profitability point of the view. Can you give just even a qualitative sense? 
Andrew Florance: Very challenging…
Brian Radecki: I'll try and address that. I think you know we obviously just expanded into those, so sales are actually, as everybody knows, we take about two years researching it before we even have a product. So, we really have only been starting to sell in those markets for short period of time, and as Andy said, in some of the very small markets like a Lubbock, Texas or a Syracuse, we weren't going to fly people in for the very small account, but those large accounts we would. I would say we are still very early on and I would say a low 5%, it's not huge numbers for CoStar, so as profitability goes, I think we are actually, not exact numbers but I think that we are probably approaching sort of a breakeven point in those and we will probably hit that over the next year or so. So, I think that it's very positive and things are going well in those markets. As people can remember, going into some of these smaller markets. It's much easier to do the research; it's not complex as the larger markets. So the overall cost to do these markets on sort of a per building basis is a lot less than it would be sort of our large core markets. One of the things that strikes me, so remember, markets that are three or four years old are not exciting in profitability over a 20-year history. Markets that are seven, eight years old, nine years old are very exciting for profitability.  So you got an awful lot of markets in that young zone. What I would note is that as I look around all those different markets, I am pleasantly, I don't want to use the word surprised, but I will if I wanted a better word. I'm pleasantly surprised by the amount of revenue, little pockets of revenue coming from all these different markets that are again 300 some markets, and I am not shocked by any of them that you think there's nothing happening in here, like there is a lot happening in lot of these markets, but then rather remains for quite sometime that those 20 year old and 15 year old markets will be the big profit and revenue drivers in the business.
Andrew Florance: And just one final note on that is that when you go back sort of 2007 time period we are dropping revenue from the top line and the bottom line very consistently quarter-over-quarter. What I would always tell people was, remember that whether the markets are profitable or not, we've already put the investment and we already have cost structure baked in our cost of revenue for those markets. So, each dollar that you put on the top line, if I sell $1 or a $1,000 to Lubbock, Texas, I'm paying out some commissions and those types of things, but I'm dropping 70%, 80% of it to the bottom line. So, from here on out, it's very positive every sale on those markets that we get. 
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: That's what I was trying to get at. I appreciate your time.
Operator: Thank you. We will go line of Jon Maietta from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: First question I had was if you could just remind me, you've done a great job of getting those customers who have been with you for less than five years, getting that renewal rate up to 88% today. What is the big hurdle rate? Is it mostly attrition typically having within a year or within the first six month, if you could just remind me?
Andrew Florance: It historically occurred in the first three years with a really tough time. So, you had historically, you probably saw the economy slip. I think you were seeing in first year 20% drop rates, up to something like that. It had some noise and it fluctuated but the real danger zone was the first three years.  What we did is we increased the commission structure, but we only paid it out based on pro-rata usage of the product in the first 12 months. So the sales people, if they couldn't get the people using the product in the first 12 months, they didn't get paid the full commission or much commission. As a result, the sales people really got in there and implemented the price right up front and that made the renewal rates climb and the sales drop, so it was a big success. 
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: They say compensation changes behavior.
Andrew Florance: Yes. You know, coin operated.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: And I guess the other question I had, Andy, around on the analytics front with regard to PPR in particular and as you'll productize that effort. Is there going to be a gestation period and then may be six to eight months from now we'll see a whole slew of modules coming out of PPR, or are you going to incrementally roll out services consistently overtime for the first two or three years.  
Andrew Florance: Yes. I think there have been some minor new products that are not mega-revenue drivers. They are repeat sales index which will start being distributed through PPR as an example of something that only could happen with the merger of CoStar and PPR, our data and Ruijue Peng's mathematical skills. So, that will be a example of a small incremental sort of thing, but what we are doing is we are focusing on utilizing our sales and increasing marketing infrastructure you try to reach more of PPR's potential and hit the cross-selling opportunity.  But we will probably be looking at a gestation period of a year or so, after which there is a significant product upgrade that we think will drive revenue in both, the CoStar and regional sort of local markets, as well as the PPR more institutional markets. So, I think we are going to put our head down and build what we think is a pretty good product, combining the strengths of both the companies, and realistically that's going to take a little bit of time and effort. We are not going to try to whip it out real quick, then do it right.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to the line of Brandon Dobell with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Brandon Dobell - William Blair: Andy, may be some color on what the receptivity is these days to cross-sell or up-sell pitches in the sales force and others? Those things take a while to get traction, but with the improving market, I would think you'd be seeing some sort of letting indicators that people are more receptive, asking for a second callback, that kind of thing. I'm just trying to get a feel for how do I think about the trajectory for the cross-sell opportunity, either it was in the core products or between core analytics or the opportunity was moving to maybe Showcase as the customer last year, up to a bigger number?
Andrew Florance: Yeah, I think that definitely happens. So, one of the things going into a recession, you have good clients who maybe buying 5 or 6 modules and they shave that down to 3 modules that they really, really need. I anticipate that as we get some recovery, people began adding back modules and people dint have multiple module start picking up modules, and we are in fact seeing anecdotal evidence of that. We are seeing people add additional seats, we are seeing people add additional geographies again. Now, the reality of our business is that it tends to be usually half cross-sell, half new business and it moves up a couple of points, it moves down a couple of points. So, it might move up a couple of points. I am still very focused especially these analytic products on just completely net new customers. I think there is a huge potential for completely net new customers over the next three years in these analytic products. I think that will be a big story. So I hope cross-selling goes up, net new customer acquisition goes up and that 50-50 fight will continue to I guess the upper end. And one other thing is, you mentioned that Showcase thing. You mentioned that Showcase thing, I think our sales team did a great job of ramping that up from zero to 10,000 in about two years. In the process, we probably didn't do a good job as we could have in recognizing those customers weren't just Showcase customers, they were property potential customers.  So, only one in seven of those individual Showcase customers are property information customers, leaving six out of seven as prospects for our broader information products. And so what I really want to try to focus the sales force on is going back and cross-selling that group on at the line. And that could double the revenue from that segment, and the head of our telesales group is really focusing on that now. So, I think you hit the nail on the head with that potential.
Brandon Dobell - William Blair: Okay. And then one quick one for Brian. Any change in terms of how customers are interacting with you guys from a cash flow DSO perspective, they are asking for better terms, longer terms, different terms or has stabilization in the market given the opportunity to come back and get better terms from them?
Brian Radecki: I mean I mentioned a little bit, but just everything overall is extremely positive and the health of the client base is just night and day compared to last year where clients are really looking to extend. They are making a payment every month, and of course as we go back to conference call scripts, you know, 80% plus of all the people we lost last year really just turned their lights out and shut the phones off into CoStar right before they left. So, really you know, and I sort of talked about that last year, I think once you serve, whoever was unhealthy in the client base was going to disappear and they pretty much did.  So I think I look at, you know, bad debt is down, DSOs continue to approve each quarter, our AR is below consensus 2007, we've added two companies and we've added a lot of revenue. So, much improved conditions obviously $11.5 million of cash flow, people are paying us again. They are not extending credit as much, it is very, very positive, and again that was just some other major change in the overall economy, you know it can go up forever like that, but I expect those numbers to basically continue at these types of levels, sort of moving forward which again is very positive for the business.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to the line of Ian Corydon from B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead. 
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company: The decline in the number of, sequentially that was caused by the UK. Is that expected to continue?
Andrew Florance: So the UK is relatively small part, I mean it's 10% of our business is, and their per unit pricing is lower over there. I think that I believe the big UK firms have now cycled renewals. So we've probably seen the reduction in headcount in subscriptions already and again the big difference in the UK and the US is the surveyors or brokers in the UK are on salaries. There is incentive for the firms to cut people. Here there are on commission.  There wasn't incentive for the firms to cut people. So I think that's happened. The other thing is that just sort of tactically or on a noise level, you've got two things going on, you get this sales force in UK all of a sudden going after Showcase, and the real story is they signed up a thousand for our first new international product, but that doesn't translate to net new subscribers. So, you know it's sort of a question of are you using the metrics to manage the business or are you matching the business to achieve the metrics, and metrics are a tool, they are not what we are trying to do here.  We are trying to grow the business. So I think this quarter with that I am glad they increased the, I am glad they launch the Showcase quite successfully over there. You know it didn't grow subscribers because they were cross-selling, and I understand tactically what our VP of Sales in the UK is doing, where he is trying to get the headcounts down as low as possible. So, as the UK firms begin to recover, he can charge them some incremental ads back again. So, the metrics you want to report positive metrics across the board everyday, but this time around, you get sort of the noise factor and I'm comfortable with it, and just to add a couple of pieces of other information on that, Ian, so what would I expect is that in the UK as we said, a lot of these and we did the very similar thing in the US, we're sort of going after our current clients. So, even if they are signing up for Showcase and they start paying us dollars, when are adding new paying subs.  So, what I think over the next few quarters, the more important metric that I would be looking at. I would be looking at all of them as we always do, but I think the important one will be the number of firms that we sort of, new firms and firms that we sign up in our site numbers, I would not expect to see significant paying sub numbers over the next few quarters, because again, essentially the one that were selling might already on a CoStar or some other sub type of CoStar service. So again, we will keep looking at those numbers. There are obviously important numbers, along with all the other ones to report, but I think that the focus the next few quarters will be less on that paying sub-number and more on like firms and sites.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company: Got it. Last question was just on the cost of goods. It came down by about 800,000 sequentially. What's the right number going forward?
Brian Radecki: I mentioned that a little bit, it's really more just a transfer of costs between quarters. It's when the research training classes go. It's where we send out our ACS postcards. So, I think again kind back to my original guidance, I think it will come back up to those more normalized levels. Because of the size of research having 900 or 1,000 people, that number can fluctuate in the quarter, 500,000, 600,000 from quarter-to-quarter, but overall for the year, again, we are not making any significant reductions there. It will just be shifting across between quarters and when things happen.
Operator: Okay. And we will go to the line of Jim Wilson with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: I guess, Andy, sort of answered my first question which was timing of when you think you complete and or roll out of the AVM product and your real estate valuation tools, but it sounds like sometime next year is most likely?
Andrew Florance: Yes. And I would probably give you better color on that over the next two quarters as we narrow down the specifications a little tighter. This is what I perceive to be one of our mutli-decadal timeframe. I think it is going to be one of our biggest flagship products. Well, the potential for what we can do here I think is tremendous. I am very optimistic about it. I think it will have a huge positive impact for our customers. And it is an ambitious construction project will take a lot of efforts. It's not something that's going to happen in around two or three quarters, it will be four, five quarters. But we will keep you updated on it as we get more information. 
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: I agree on the prospect given what I've heard from banks, et cetera and the need for something like this. The other question then is just, I was wondering a little bit because I'm not sure I've been able to figure that math out of what average new signed contract values look like in the quarter, either I guess in general or versus the ones that roll off. I know they've been smaller new contracts for a while and I was just wondering if that was changing or evolving as things have gotten a little better.
Andrew Florance: Jim, I think a lot of things happened this quarter that are going to challenge the analysts to get that. I'll let Brian try to answer that 
Brian Radecki: Yeah, real quick, Jim, on the average contract value, it has been running in the $7,000 to $8,000, $9,000 range and it popped up. Last quarter we talked about the fact that the average contract value for PPR went up to just over 100,000. The prior two quarters we owned and it was around 50,000 in sort of this quarter. It went back down more to a normalized level. So, we just some couple of nice very positive good big contracts come in there.  We sold another $500,000 or so cross-sells that's still continuing to go well, but we are sort of back down to a more normalized level. The other thing that decreased just a little bit and I did talk about this on the last quarter. It's sort of like the renewal rates, you can't expect it to go up every quarter, a lot of it depends on the focus in the focus in that quarter of the sales force. As Andy mentioned, we sold over a hundred units of this new product which is a very low end product, and that we are starting to push and it is a subscription product on annual contracts.  So it is counted in that number. That probably reduced the average by about 1,000 or 1,500 in the quarter. So, these are numbers that are good numbers to keep tracking. There will be reasons why they go up and down each quarter, depending on the focus of the sales force. But you know all positive reasons why it's going up or going down.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: And you did you look forward in your guidance, maybe you would know if there was any big contracts on the horizon of PPR superbig, but is that sort of assuming 50,000 kind of normal rate for the rest the year on PPR contracts?
Andrew Florance: Yeah, I think we sort of always assume the normalized thing. Obviously, if you get something in that's large or big, you'd rather have that as sort of upside than sort of making assumptions for it and have it not come in. So, when you look at my guidance ranges, I mean obviously, people forget. It was literally only three quarters ago, revenue was dropping. So, I'm of course being cautious. So, I am assuming sort of average stuff and then if something comes in like that, its upside.
Andrew Florance: Well, with this we are going to go ahead and wrap up the second quarter earnings call and we appreciate you all joined us and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter and hope you join us and crossing your fingers that the economy continues to show strength. Thank you.

The replay will also be available on CoStar’s website for a period of time following the call. Thank you again for joining us. I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Florance: Thank you Tim, I appreciate it. Welcome everyone to CoStar Group’s first quarter 2010 conference call. I am very pleased to report the initial signs of economic improvement we reported last quarter had continued to strengthen throughout our business during this first quarter and this has all resulted in strong organic quarterly sales performance and a record $55.1 million in quarterly revenue. The $55.1 million in quarterly revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was an increase of approximately 500,000 over $54.6 million revenue during the fourth quarter of 2009. It was about a $5 million increase over the revenues a year ago same quarter. First quarter 2010 EBITDA was $8.8 million and the company’s net income was $2.9 million during the first quarter. We are investing aggressively in our business in anticipation of economic recovery. We had invested by growing our sales force 32% year-over-year with the addition of nearly 50 net new sales professionals. We have also invested in the quality and depth of our research by adding 100 net new researchers year-over-year. We believe that this distressed real estate market has presented a unique opportunity for us to control long-term occupancy cost. So we’ve invested by purchasing a new headquarters building and made the decision to consolidate leases in both Boston and London. We believe that advancing from what traditionally been a research focused business to one that includes analysis and applied research presents a tremendous growth opportunity for our company and so we've had a key personnel and have acquired and we are integrating Property And Portfolio Research and Resolve Technology in to CoStar Group.  With these investments, coupled with ongoing our organic sales momentum, we believe the company is well positioned to achieve accelerated high margin revenue growth as commercial state markets recover. We are pursuing these opportunities with the benefit of a strong balance sheet. At the end of quarter, the company had a total of $218.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, and we have no long-term debt obligations. We had a very strong subscriber growth during the first quarter adding 1,265 new subscribers to take our total subscriber base to 86,590. This is the third quarter in a row in which we have turned in strong subscriber growth. Our renewal rates remained very high in the first quarter 2010. The 12 month trailing renewal rates for subscription based services improved to approximately 86% in the first quarter of 2010 from approximately 85% in the forth quarter of 2009. This improvement in renewal rates is a direct result of our successful efforts to retain the business of newer customers. 18 months ago we identified the need to improve our renewal rate among firms that have been customers for less than five years. We noted that on average our newer customers use the service less than our more established customers and that the low usage rates were directly co-related with lower renewal probability. We attack this problem by gradually changing our sales professionals commission plan such that they are paid for this sales, the salesmen would get their commission when a customer has used the service rather when they signed up to buy the service. The net result was a dramatic improvement in usage within new customers’ sites. In 2008, an average 38% of the authorized user at first year client sites where actively using our service. So by 2009 that active user rate has climbed to 53% among first year client sites. Our revised commission plan appears to have translated directly in the higher new customer renewal rates and fewer failed sales. The new customer renewal rate were 70% in the first quarter of 2009. That renewal rate has climbed to 85% in first quarter of 2010. The average new contract value increased to $9,365 in the first quarter of 2010 from $9,143 in fourth quarter of 2009. This increase was driven upward by the Property And Portfolio Research average new contracts value of $107,383. We’ve had tremendous success with CoStar accounting introduced in the PPR team to CoStar customers and vice-versa with the result being millions of dollars in annualized subscription value cross sold. The total number of subscription client sites remained approximately 16,000 company wide. All major business services CoStar U.S. PPR SHOWCASE in U.K had positive organic growth in revenue in their local currencies for the first quarter in 2010. We posted a second consecutive quarter of positive net bookings. The total for the first quarter 2010 was approximately 1.6 million company wide reflecting the positive impact of an increase in our overall gross sales. The increase in first quarter organic revenue we enjoy this past quarter was our first quarterly increase in organic revenues since the economy went into a recession. As the same increased in former subscribers returning to the become subscribers again, contributed to our organic revenue growth here in the quarter. In addition to wining back these former clients, we are also seeing orders from existing customers to add additional users, services and expand market coverage at a rate that we have not seen since before the start of the recession. Overall, I am very encouraged by the strengthening positive trends we have seen in our sales activity over the past three quarters. Although we are realistic that the past to a full recovery could be choppy during this transition year, we remain optimistic that we will likely see continuing positive sales performance through the rest of 2010. One major reason for optimism is the total potential size of the market that we see for our services. We firmly believe that we could earn hundreds of millions of dollars in potential additional annual subscription revenue by achieving higher penetration for our services throughout the U.S. We also believe that there are more than 10,000 plus brokerage firms in the U.S. that we could win as new clients. In order to pursue this opportunity we have invested heavily in growing our sales force this year. As I mentioned earlier, we have grown our sales force headcount 32% year-over-year to take our sales force to a total of 203 personnel. This includes 127 U.S. subscription sales reps, 8 U.S. advertising sales reps, 43 in-house sales reps, 19 U.K. field sales reps and six sales reps for PPR and Resolve. This was only a 3% FTE increase quarter-over-quarter. I think it’s worth noting that the quality and experience of the sales reps we have been able to onboard this downturn has been uniformly exceptional. Our sales are benefiting from the level of sales town available in the market and the effective training programs we have implement, a clear indicator of this is the average gross sales per sales rep in production. In the first quarter of 2010 the sales production measure was the highest it’s been since 2007.  Sales of our Showcase online marking service was strong this past quarter and continued to build on the growth that our internet marketing service generated in 2009. In fact, we are fast closing in on 10,000 subscribers just two years since its launch. At the end of the first quarter, there were approximately 9,750 total Showcase subscribers in the U.S. and the service is generating more than $6 million in annualized revenue. We believe that this service has been successful because of its low cost for value; it’s no hassle, no registration requirements before seeing the ads and the ease of maintaining listing inventories that are already in CoStar property. We are very pleased to announce that with the launch of Showcase in United Kingdom this past quarter, CoStar has launched its first international service offering. We have already signed up dozens of British firms to our Showcase U.K. service. In fact I think the number is 48 or 50. As we did with our Showcase launch in the U.S. our early adopter clients in the U.K. are on trail contracts, some number mentioned now on the firm contracts but that’s basically got to do with the U.S. We assigned people initially on trial contract, and a very high of them went into permanent paying obligations and commitments to the service. As part of the launch, we had to complete a successful integration effort of our U.S. and U.K. back-end data systems. We believe that this will pave the way for more integrated and uniform international service offerings in the future. We also expect these integrated services will give us more skill in our software offerings and I believe make our services more attractive to potential clients, thereby driving significant additional sales. The last few quarters have provided convincing signs of economic rebound. Leasing throughout the U.S. in the quarter was up dramatically from one year ago and has increased in each of the past four consecutive quarters. Tenants that put off making long-term financial commitments in the down turn and postpone decisions in our expectation that rental rates would drop are now getting back in the market ahead of the expense recovery and are seeking to take advantage of the currently favorable leasing conditions.  This is driving record levels of leasing activity in the United States. And because leasing activity as a measure total leases signed an outer measure of growth in the net demand for office space. It’s a good proxy for leasing commission which is likely the single largest source of revenue for our core customers. Improving leasing activity creates the environment that was conducive to CoStar’s first quarter solid increase in net new subscribers, high customer renewal rates and our new record quarterly revenue. Other positive economic indicators include high net absorption of vacant space, signs of vacancy stabilization, less job losses and job growth and office using employment segments. Also we saw continued positive GDP growth and an increase in consumer spending in March. Most economists expect 2010 to be a transitional year for the economy. I want to take a minute to discuss the defining trends at work in the market right now and how we believe they will impact commercial real state for the foreseeable future and how we expect they will affect our business. With the increase in leasing activity flat to positive absorption and little new construction, vacancy rates are beginning to stabilize across many markets. In fact, vacancy rates are beginning to drop in many markets. A decline in average rental rates have slowed and rents are even turning up in some markets. One wild card however, is that there is a lot of phantom vacancy in the form of empty but leased office space or space behind a thousands and thousands of companies that laid off staff during the down turn. As demand retuned to the markets, this phantom vacancy will likely be absorbed first which could dampen leasing demand and ultimately the recovery itself. The investment sales debt in real estate capital markets continue to face serious challenges. Sales volumes are down from recent inflated levels, credit markets remain in disarray and much uncertainty exists ahead of the 1.4 trillion in commercial estate mortgages expected to come due over the next three to four years. The combination of cap rates reverting back to long-term means falling rents and decreasing occupancy levels has decimated commercial real estate values over the last two years. Last week, Dr. Pang [ph], Dr. Norm Miller, Dr. Ming Zong Hong [ph] and my self all at CoStar present a paper index in commercial real estate values we have repeat sales at the National Conference of the American Real Estate Society. We co-author this paper with Karl Case due its same with the Case-Shiller Residential real estate value index based on the repeat sales. We believe that the index we have produced is one of the purest, most robust and authoritative indexes of commercial real estate values. Using 94,000 properties from CoStar’s database that are sold more than once since 1995, we determined that commercial real estate values peaked in the third quarter of 2007, after having increased 257% from the same period a decade prior. Commercial real estate value had since plunged 30% from that peak to year-end 2009. And while commercial real estate values have climbed 4% during first quarter of 2010, overall values are still down 27% from the third quarter of 2007 peak. We published another paper last week at American Real Estate Society estimating the total value of the U.S. commercial real estate stock. We estimate the current value to be approximately $10 trillion. Based on our true analyses, the industry lost approximately $4 trillion in value from the peak of the market, keeping it in perspective we still see our position as the leasing information and analytics provider for a $10 trillion U.S. industry as a very exciting place to be with immense growth potential. As for market conditions affecting current property values, we believe that more than 20% of the leveraged commercial properties in the U.S. today have lower values than their mortgages because the majority of leases being signed today are at a significant discount to what they were four or five years ago, the increase in leasing activity is not excepted to increase the net operating incomes of properties over the next two years. Without increases in net operating incomes, we do not expect significant increases in value. It follows that we’ll likely see a large numbers of the falls in distressed sales over the next three years. So the market going forward is likely a bit difficult for existing owners and lenders but good for brokers’ appraisers and future owners. The majority of CoStar’s revenue is derived from subscribers involved in leasing activity and property evaluation. We also hope to sell an increasing number of hedge funds, opportunity funds, REITs and other future owners. We see an opportunity to make information and market analysis CoStar offers available to the owners and lenders dealing with the new realities of the current environment. More than ever, we believe investors, lenders, appraisers, government agencies and others involved in establishing the value of commercial property in a volatile sales market stand to benefit from CoStar’s information and applied research. For all these reasons I believe CoStar is extremely well poisoned to capture the significant opportunities we see resulting from the current market dynamics in commercial real estate. We continue to see strong demand for PPR’s enhanced analytic and forecasting services from CoStar’s existing clients and for CoStar’s information and services among PPR’s existing client base. We signed 1.1 million in cross sales contracts during the first quarter of 2010 to continue the strong trend we had established in the third and fourth quarter of 2009. The integration of our two back end systems is proceeding smoothly and PPR is now using more CoStar information to support their analysis and forecasting capabilities. Vice versa CoStar is using a lot of the PPR analytics in our various presentation and webinars and alike. In the first quarter of 2010, CoStar’s research team continue to expand our data base to unprecedented levels adding more than 42,000 listings, approximately 97,000 properties and 0.5 million digital images. We now have close to 3 million buildings in our U.S. database. We have doubled the U.S. database since the peak of the market adding more than 1.5 million buildings since 2007. I really think that’s if you’re starting to reflecting that’s an amazing number, adding 1.5 million buildings to our database in basically a three-year period. Over the last 12 months, customers accessed information on 100% of these properties, so in other words, our customers actually accessed and looked at 100% of the 3 million buildings in our database. On average, the average property was viewed 385 times in the last 12 months, so 3 million properties viewed almost 400 times. We believe that our impressive database growth directly corresponds to the growth in long-term potential revenue and creates increasingly higher barriers to entry.  Let me close my remarks by saying that we couldn’t be happier with the clear signs of renewed strength in our business. We believe we continue to improve retaining sales; higher renewal rates and increasing subscriber counts are clear indications that we’ve entered initial recovery in growth base. We fully expect to achieve high margin revenues growth as the market recovery strengthens.  During the downturn last year, we took the opportunity to invest in and expand our business in a number of important areas and set the stage for increasing shareholder value in the recovery period. CoStar has experienced tremendous growth over the past 20 plus years and we believe that we’ve now have become an indispensable information utility for the commercial real estate industry. Achieving a leadership position and serving the information needs of a dynamic $10 trillion industry should not be confused with reaching a saturation point for our business. We believe CoStar Group is still in that early stages of realizing a total market potential for our Research and Services. Certainly the recent severe industry downturn has slowed our progress towards our goal of reaching over $1 billion in revenue. We’re also reconfirmed the value of our research based information and proven business model for the recovery emerging some of the headwinds appear to fading and before long we could potentially see something tailwinds for our business. We remain singularly focused on growing CoStar’s business towards a $1 billion in high margin revenue. At this point, I am going to turn the call over to Brian Radecki, our CFO who will walk you through the first quarter numbers. Brian?
Brian Radecki : Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned we are pleased to report we’ve achieved solid financial results for the first quarter 2010 with record revenues as we continue to see positive momentum in many areas of our business. Today I’m going to principally focus on the sequential results for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and also our outlook for the second quarter and full year of 2010. We believe the sequential trends offer the most insights into the performance of our business as we continue to progress through the current economic and commercial real estate cycle. As Andy mentioned, first quarter revenues came in stronger than anticipated at $55.1 million, an increase of approximately $0.5 million over the fourth quarter of 2009. A record revenue performance during the quarter was primarily driven by organic company wide net new sales as Andy mentioned. Subscription revenues in the first quarter accounted for approximately 94.5% of all of our revenues. On a functional currency basis, international revenue was approximately £3.1 million which had positive organic subscription revenues in the first quarter and in line with our expectations. International revenues were approximately 8.7% of the company’s total revenues in the first quarter. As of March 31, 2010 our 12 month trailing renewal rate which is a measure of renewing subscription revenue was approximately 86%. As I have publicly stated for about two years now we expect that our 12 month trailing renewal rates to decline from low to mid 80s in 2009 and then begin to recover in 2010. We ended 2009 at approximately 85% with our Q4 in quarter renewal rates turning out significantly. We are pleased to see our 12 months trailing renewal rate continue to increase and move back towards the historical average approximately 90%, customer retention efforts and company wide contract bookings continue to improve. Turning now to gross margin, gross margin was approximately $33.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, and was flat compared to Q4 2009. Q1’s gross margin includes the full impact of PPR results of lower overall gross margin in the Investments and Research that was discussed on previous calls. Moving down the income statement, total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2010 were $28.8 million compared to $27.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, in line with our outlook for the first quarter. The increase in operating expenses as we discussed on the last call was principally due to seasonally higher payroll taxes and benefits in the first quarter, our January annual company wide sales conference and some initial building caring cost related to the new corporate headquarters in Washington D.C. Turning to profitability, our first quarter 2010 income was $2.9 million or $0.14 per diluted share with non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.25 and EBITDA our earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization of approximately $8.8 million. A reconciliation of EBITDA, non-GAAP net income per share and all historical non-GAAP financial measures discussed today on this call are shown in detail in our press release issued yesterday which is available on our website at www.costar.com. Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with approximately $218.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Our balance sheet also reflects the acquisition of the office building in Washington D.C. for our corporate headquarters of approximately $41.25 million in cash which we announced in February. The company continues to have no long term debt. I will now speak to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2010, as its typical our guidance takes into account recent revenue growth rates and results maybe impacted by the economic conditions in the commercial real estate or overall economy. Our forward-looking guidance reflects our current expectations as of April 21, 2010. We expect revenue for the second quarter of 2010 in the range of $54.5 million to $55.5 million and we reiterate our full year guidance of approximately $218 million to $222 million of revenue. After the first quarter of organic sales we are confident that we are tracking towards the middle to upper end of the annual guidance range and we continue to expect that new positive sale trends continue as Andy mentioned. Our guidance on the impact for foreign currency exchange fluctuations on our top-line results remains consistent. We do not attempt to predict the foreign exchange fluctuations and our guidance assumes little or no volatility for the current rate. The average exchange rate for the first quarter of 2010 was £1.56 to U.S. dollars and our 2010 guidance which is unchanged continue to assume 1.6 for the majority of the year. Not only layered in a full quarter of PPR result in investments in research, we expect CoStar revenues to be stabilized and to be in the $21 million range plus or minus with few 100,000. Moving down the P&L we expect selling and market expenses in the second quarter of approximately $12.5 million to $13.5 million which includes our difficult second quarter increase for the annual ICSC trade show in May. We expect software development of approximately $4.2 million to $4.7 million in G&A expenses to remain relatively consistent in the $10.5 million to the $11.5 million dollar range. The mechanics of our effective tax rate continue to be affected by the modern income and loss in our U.K. entities. Tax expense and benefits in U.K. will not be equivalent to the U.S. rates and therefore our effective rates may be blended. In addition any acquisition tax spending strategies or large one time gains or losses may affect the actual tax rates for 2010. With that in mind, we continue to currently expect the effective rate to be in the 40% to 44% range for the year, with individual quarters possibly being a little over or little under this range. As we indicate in recent earnings calls beginning with the first quarter 2010 results, we began adding additional non-GAAP financial disclosures. We believe that both management and investors can benefit from referring to the non-GAAP financial measures in assessing performance and planning and forecasting future periods. For additional information please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our Press Release posted on our website. In terms of earnings, we expect second quarter 2010 fully diluted net income per share of approximately $0.13 to $0.15 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of approximately $0.22 to $0.24 per share. Our second quarter outlook for GAAP net income includes approximately $300,000 to $500,000 of cost related to the transition of our corporate headquarters in D.C. as defined in our press release for non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which is excluded in the transition related equity compensation cost. For 2010, we iterate our expectation from GAAP net income per share of approximately $0.60 to $0.65 per share, non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $1.06 to $1.22 per share. But we expect to grow our earnings in the second half of 2010 and achieve our outlook even with the short term dilution with net income resulting from our investments over the past 12 months that Andy mentioned with our largest sales force, extended research and recent acquisitions of PPR result. For the full year 2010 we continue to expect approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share of dilution due to investments in result services which we anticipate results and additional penetration among the commercial real estate owners and investors in the future. In addition for fiscal year 2010, we continue to expect $3 million to $3.5 million in cost related to the acquisition and transition of our corporate headquarters in Washington D.C. and approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million in restructuring and other cost related to the leases tends the consolidation of CoStar, PPR and Resolve officers into a single location in Boston which we expect to occur later this year. The cost in 2010 related to the acquisition and transition of our corporate headquarter in Washington D.C. are expected to primarily include overlapping occupancy cost at end of our current lease terms and the carrying cost associated with the new building. Our current headquarter office lease expires on October 15th, 2010. We anticipate moving just slightly before that. After this period, we expect to save approximately $2 million a year in occupancy cost for headquarters in 2011 compared to 2010. Once we get pass the transitionary cost this year, we believe we will accredit significant long-term value by reducing the company’s long-term cost structures for decades and decades to come. In closing, we are thrilled with this record first quarter revenues results and the momentum we’re seeing in our business. Our business model remain strong facing the fact that we have a 95% subscription based business with high renewal rates, a unique proprietary data base, market leading position, strong balance sheet, no debt and continued high operating cash flow. We expect to return to more normalized organic growth rate and expanding margins that we have enjoyed over the past decade in the near future as we continue to see positive trends in our business and provide we continue to see positive trend in the overall economy. CoStar’s management team believes there is significant opportunity for high additional revenue margin growth following the investments we have made in research sales with strategic acquisitions like PPR and Resolve. We continue to look forward to reporting our progress to you. And with that, I’ll open it up then call for questions.
Operator: Thanking you. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from the line of Timo Connor with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Timo Connor - William Blair: Couple of questions around the renewal rates. Do you have any additional color around the in quarter renewal rates for the first quarter?
Brian Radecki: Yeah. The in quarter renewal rates was higher than the 12 months trailing and slightly lower than last quarter but it was higher than the 12 months trailing quarter. So we continue to see a lot of progress there. DSOs continue to get better, bad debt expense was down, write-off were down. So we continue to see progress there. We believe that the 12 month trailing renewal rate will continue to improve throughout the year, end up in the kind of high 80s.
Timo Connor - William Blair: Do you see quarter-over-quarter remaining on the high 80s?
Brian Radecki: Yeah. We have a reasonable visibility looking for the quarter and we don’t have any reason at this point to believe that we’re seeing anything but improvement in renewal rates. That’s correct. 
Timo Connor - William Blair:  Thank you. Would you mind going over, I know you covered it earlier but again over the usage levels, especially customer segments.
Andrew Florance: Sure. So I think you’re refereeing to our efforts with new customers?
Timo Connor - William Blair: Yes, correct.
Andrew Florance: Okay. Right so. We end up putting a hundred authorized users into a decent size site like a major institutional investor site that we do not expect of all 100 IDs to be used. We typically see about 80% plus of the IDs that are consistently actively used. One other things we noticed was that we have low renewal rates among the brand new customers that’s because basically a manager or an officer that’s signed up to take on the CoStar service, once they made a decision that’s necessarily mean the staff will use the product.  And it can take up to five years before the staff has bigger location will really inaugurating CoStar into their day-to-day operations. Because of that we saw a lower renewal rate about 70% or 65% renewal rate among our newest customers. So we went at that by paying our sales people for actually getting new customers to use the services rather than to sign them up and has been extremely effective. The usage levels have gone from what, 37% to 50 some percent among the newest customers. And we’re now getting our new customer up to established customer usage levels within about two years or so. And that translated to us seeing almost the same renewal rate for new customers as for old customers. So we’re really quite happy with that. That said, accelerated our past few organic growth.
Timo Connor - William Blair: And did you see the customer renewal rate from five year plus customers staying within their mind with fourth quarter? 
Andrew Florance: Correct.
Timo Connor - William Blair: Thank you. CoStar progress with analytics, would you mind just covering that a little bit. I think mentioned 2 million in quarters three and four of PPR cross sold to CoStar subscription clients. Do you see that continue?
Brian Radecki: Yes. That was two million sum in the first, in the third and fourth quarter of ’09. And we saw 1.1 million in the first quarter of ’10. So I couldn’t be after that. That’s a phenomenal level. And we’ve got a very large composition there. PPR has a 180, 190, 180 some customers and CoStar has hundreds and hundreds of institutional customers that currently subscribe to PPR. So we’re basically introducing the PPR sales team to those folks and continue to get good cross sales. And really CoStar resolves any product issues that PPR had where they didn’t have a granularity of data and PPR resolves a lot product issues where CoStar didn’t have multi family or didn’t have forecasting or debt modeling. So we really got a new solution that is meeting a comprehensive need set for the institutional players. And we’re having a lot of competitive wins. So as I understand it, I’m hearing that a very high percentage of these cross sells are wins from a direct competitor. So that should continue on through 2010 and we’ll also be looking to release a new product that is some where between the CoStar lower price point for institutional player and the PPR higher price point either late 2010 or early 2011. I think that will enable us to do even more cross selling. I'm very happy with that. Now we haven’t yet begun in earnest but we’ve not yet begun the cross selling process between Resolve, CoStar and PPR. For that I think that like wise has an awful lot of potential. We’ll be able to sell PPR data into Resolve and CoStar data in the Resolve and Resolve back to CoStar PPR customers. 
Timo Connor - William Blair: Great, thanks. And on the sale force you mention that new increase but what about on the retention side?
Andrew Florance: Well, we’ve seen a dramatic improvement in retention. So the, obviously in this economy we’ve seen our turnover rate drop in half, probably across the board and we also are really quite pleased with the quality of candidates we’re selecting from right now. So we have going to bring on board some real players that are out there on the sale side.
Timo Connor - William Blair: Okay. Average deal size increased slightly especially maybe driven by PPR. Could you provide a little more context about the increases especially on the subscription side?
Brian Radecki: Sure. This million dollars in cross selling activity in PPR was probably 10 accounts or nine accounts. So we are selling in the lot high value solutions into large institution on the PPR side. So that’s driving the averages price point where the headcount. And as we put financial sales people out there, we should see that continue to go up. In the CoStar traditional product lines, subscription product lines in the U.S. I think they’re basically stable, roughly the same price point. We do have some initiative in the rest of the year which will be targeting, actively targeting higher volume low price points on a particular, some particular customer segment. So it will probably drive the CoStar side down a little because of high volume in the low end and the PPR the pulling it back up. So we are at build up the high end and we’re doing well at low end pretty much with the competing forces. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then finally just to a real quick question on trends and broker headcount, what do you think when your customer specially on the mid sized brokers?
Andrew Florance: Well, I think that many of those who were going to die in this downturn has died and I had a couple of lunches with industry leadership recently where they are extremely bullish. So, if you’re looking at commercial real estate brokerage firms out there, I think many of them that has had their best quarter ever and I wouldn’t be surprised if you did some earnings surprises. So this whole thing with leasing activity, hitting a new high it’s really real. We hit the highest leasing activity number in the fourth quarter of '09. It takes about a month or so after the end of the quarter really getting good sense of where it’s going to finally land. But the fourth quarter leasing number of '09 was blow away number. It would likely be higher than the leasing activity number we saw in 2000 which was you still in that .com zone. So it's well above anything we saw in '07 or '06 and that could translate into leasing commissions which is broker revenue.  So I don’t see brokerage firms today reducing headcount. The only folks to be reducing headcount would be boutique shops that really did investment sales only. But they would have reduced their headcount in the middle of '09 and their watching their brethren over on the leasing side of the equation make a lot of money right now and they are hoping that their turn is next. So, I think we’re sort passed the headcount reduction phase.
Unidentified Analyst: One more probably this is the last one. Any changes in non-customers are paying payment cycle that you seeing that move from one year to quarterly perhaps?
Brian Radecki: No, actually they’ve been pretty consistent. The majority of our customer base pays monthly and we do have some larger accounts that like to pay quarterly or annually. But the majority have always paid monthly even though they are under contract for a year or longer. Well I can say that the as I mentioned earlier the accounts receivable, the days that people are extending payment is reducing receivables are getting much better, bad debts write off also reducing. So you can definitely see in lot of different metrics in the business effect, the clients are starting to get healthier.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Maietta with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co.: Good morning. First question I had was around just to piggyback around that question around cross sell opportunities. To what extent is the CoStar's install base familiar with PPR, Resolve? I am just trying to get a sense of what level of education has to be put forth when you are trying to up sell those two platforms? 
Andrew Florance: I would actually think that the awareness would fairly low at this point for Resolve. Realistically I think Resolve has one sales person to cover the United States of America, PPR had four or five sales people to cover the United States. Neither firm engaged in aggressive marketing activities. So these firms are historically targeting the very top of institutional stock and what we’re doing is bringing a much broader sales and marketing approach to the organization. So with an average price points north of a hundred thousand annually where you’re expecting to have multiyear contracts, these are reasonably high end sales and they are done with direct field sales force and typically two meetings. So it's something with education process that occurs face to face and is fairly straight forward. But when you bring a 100 sales people to bear on something we had one or four, you can expect a lot of cross selling potential and these are great products, the PPR products have the forecast, the analysis with economist are doing there. It’s very high quality stuff. We believe it's industry leading. Their result product that we have a ton of potential. So once you get that meeting the education process is very fairly straight forward. And I think this whole cross selling has a lot of legs to it. 
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co.: Got it. Okay. That is helpful. And a question for you around property owners, that is certainly the segment in the economy that is suffering the most. Do you have a sense as to when do you think the owners face sort of the toughest time period? Is it 2010? Is it 2011? Is it 2012? When does print tenant extend and sort of come up and hit these guys in the face?
Andrew Florance: Right. So I will also give you some specific numbers and we used to do a survey in the UK and 72% of the respondent were familiar with CoStar and I believe that single digit were familiar with PPR unaided very worthy. When the owners confront, extend and pretend. Well and as the owner of our building it's not turning up every other light in the stairwell and the lobby. So I am guessing that's an aggressive cost cutting move or an effort to try to get Energy Star. So I am thinking that you got a high percentage of the loans that were issued in 2007 at the peak of the market were five year bubble loans, non amortizing loan. So they are going roll the peak of the worst loan were roll in 2012 but there was still lot of very bubble like activity in 2006 which will roll in 2011. You look at the volume of activities that are occurred in '06, '07 and as phenomenal may so that will be '11 and '12 should be fairy hairy year and they are going to be hoping that the lack of supply will bring up rents in time to make a possible refinances loans. But I think you will be seeing a study stream of folks coming to reality, the mid part of '10 all they way through to 2017 because you got 10 years the CMBS loans from '06 and, 07 rolling 10 years off back. So I think you are going to have small percentage single digit percentage owners owner facing the music each year for the next five or six years.  
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co.: Okay. And then just the last question from me is where does the UK sit, in terms of what they are seeing with regard to absorption trends, vacancy rates, so on and so forth?
Andrew Florance: Identical. For example they would argued that their I think they probably a bit euphoric about the pace of recovery. To me it feels about the same. As an example thought rents in the city are up 12% quarter -over-quarter and I think that not really looking free rent so they are probably out in a probably 7% 8% but that's actually happening in a couple of US markets right now. So I think it's similar. One of the difference is they have got more supply than we do, so I think their vacancy recovery bill the slower pretty much atmosphere is identical in both markets, is an optimism of thing are actually improving dramatically
Operator: The next question comes from the line of the Ian Corydon from B. Riley and Company. Please go ahead.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Co.: Thanks. On the SHOWCASE side, what is the renewal rate like for that product, and will you continue to give us subs on a quarterly basis just for modeling purposes?
Andrew Florance: Yes, that's on quarterly base for modeling. The price is being as I guess there is two answer there. One is the firm level subscription where the renewal rate would probably closer to our traditional 80% plus renewal rates. We also have the individual subscription, which are going to be sold on a month-to-month basis, and often they are sold to people who have one or two listings, so when those listing actually release up they don’t renew so you have much lower renewal rate on the individual showcase. It is better, as I understand that, we have a higher renewal rate on the individual subs than do some of our industry competitors but it’s not as high as our firm level subscriptions and sort of stabilizing out, if it’s process finding a balance point.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Co: And on PPR, you mentioned you’ve got a couple of competitive wins. On what basis are you getting those, and then are there any other milestones we should be looking at for integration of that business, besides the late 2010, early 2011 release?
Andy Florance: We’ve got a incredibly compelling value proposition to an institutional player right now. Many of our competitors, if you look at the evolution at this business of providing analysis and forecasting for commercial real-estate, back in ten years ago, nobody had a database for commercial real-estates in the United States. So people are out there reading, economists would read the (tea leaves) of what was happening in employment and GDP and try to guess as to what was occurring in vacancy rates, leasing activity, rental rates and the likes. So, there was a lot of sampling and estimation occurring in producing a key industry indicator. CoStar Group if you look at our budget for research over the last 15 years its been approaching 10,000 people a year, are mainly are effort with nearly a $1 billion expended in collecting this information, and millions and millions of interviews. So we actually have the first census level representation of what’s happening in the market within CoStar Group. And that so we are sampling the majority of the active buildings on a 30 days cycle. Our second closest competitor is sampling a subset of that on an annual cycle. So, imagine that you were trying to buy equity’s information service from someone and you need to know what the NASDAQ closed at yesterday and one company was sampling all the stocks of the NASDAQ everyday, to come up with what the NASDAQ closed at. And the other company was sampling 150 second of the NASDAQ each week for the prior year, and they were the stocks they had a sample in 30 weeks. They were estimating what they will be here today based on what they had sampled yesterday. That’s what our competitor does they do a lot of sampling and estimation, where we are actually presenting actual numbers or 30 days cycle numbers, they take that level of advantage and granular data and then you bring on the PPR analytics team where we have more PhDs and masters, economist and some of our competitors have total staff including their receptionist, and so we have got incredibly robust. So watching Dr. (Liu) Pang present the mathematics on our repeat sales index to a room of 40 or 50 real-estate professors at American Real-Estate Society and watching their eyes glaze over at the map she was presenting in alternative methods and what not has to do with index. We are at the cutting edge on the forecasting and analytic side, while we have this advantage in granular data and this is fairly easy for our sales people to present on the strengths that it is, its combination. So we are doing very well in a competitive front and our competitor in this area, primary competitors in this area only competing on price at this point. So they are going down market on price, and we were managing $100 billion real-estate portfolio, I would question how often are people going to go for $20,000 annual cost savings for information when they are managing a $100 billion portfolio or larger. So that’s why they were doing really well, and going forward, we are very excited and this has really captured the imagination of the traditional CoStar staff and the traditional PPR staff because the kinds of products and tools, we can produce in combination are phenomenal. We are actually having a retreat next week we are going over some of these products and tools. I think we are going to be able to make a quantum leap over the state-of-the-art, and their wont be any one release or any one integration point, but integrations are already occurring. We have already all the comparable sale data that PPR is using, is now coming in directly in from CoStar.  Within a year we will be all their vacancy and that sort of information will be coming in from CoStar, But the product evolution that will be created through integration that will be ongoing and you’ll be seeing product releases, bi-annually for years, of this combination and the Resolve’s product integration releases will probably be even more impactful beginning in 2011, most likely. So this has got a lot of legs to it and it’s pretty exciting.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Co.:  Okay. And last question is just on the market size. What do you think the size of the market for that kind of product is today, and how big can it be, five or ten years from now?
Andrew Florance: I think it’s multi-hundreds of million of dollars. CoStar is doing 10s of millions of revenues selling the institutional customer’s; PPR is doing roughly in the 20 million plus range. We see competitors in other foreign cities dealing more than $10 million in individual cities in revenues. You can interpolate that out pretty correctly to that being a (north) of $200 million or quarter of billion dollar revenue market in the United States, if one competitor can do, those are kinds of numbers in one city. So we think it’s a very significant market place. Then when you start building in the ability to do what Resolve does which is warehouse all the different data streams on a portfolios of properties for an institutional player and apply continuous valuation and risk information of that portfolio. I think that’s a whole new market which I think is —I wouldn’t be ready to hazard a guess, but I think that’s pretty significant marketplace as well.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: Somebody asked I think the beginning question and I was distracted what the in quarter retention rate was?
Andrew Florance: Yeah, the in quarter retention rate is above obviously the twelve month trailing and that’s one of the reason why we believe that number will continue to go up. It was slightly below what it was last quarter but it was above the twelve month trailing.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.: Did you give Resolve and PPR revenues? I know they are being integrated but just trying to get to an organic growth calc, any estimates there?  
Andrew Florance: No, I think last year when we talked about earnings for this year we said that you know PPR was in the $18 million range but still we got them. And Resolve was in the $3million -$4 million range so you’ll be able to kind of back into the organic growth rate this year based on those numbers.  
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc.:  Okay. And then Andy, you had talked about organic sales strength; I guess both you and Brian did. When you say organic sales are you using sales and revenue interchangeably, or should we take that as both revenue organic growth was pretty good, but the sales and the bookings were also good and we should see that roll forward? Can you just distinguish those, if you can?
Andrew Florance: Sure, I think they are both strong, so that would be -- you are right, so retrospectively and forward looking things were looking good. And the other thing is that its looking good across the board, so there is no one region in the United States that appear to be or United Kingdom that was still lagging all regions. All sectors appear to be doing well and moving upward so it was across the board good news.
Brian Radecki: And Brat, Andy does do that interchangeably, what I’ll say to that is that, it’s not like we have big installation lag like some companies you might buy a product, you have to install it so you can kind of take a bookings number and say, well it's a really strong bookings number. It’s going to roll through the next quarter or two quarters. Ours is -- everything is obviously fairly instantaneous. So that you could have a little bit from, you know, March sales going into April but essentially us, believing that we are going to be organic, again for the second quarter is more about our confidence in the pipeline and what we actually think we're going to sell in the second quarter. So just to kind of keep a little clarity.
Brett Huff - Stephens: Helpful. Can you just update us on what you think sort of the margin profile does? I know that you are optimistic that this is sort of a transition year and you have got some dilutive things going on that will help in the medium term. You have talked specifically about the $2 million year-over-year that should go away presumably out of G&A, because of the building costs. Can you point to any other things specifically where, the 2011, say expenses should be flat or down, versus what we presume will be sort of a rising revenue environment?
Brian Radecki: Yeah, I think in my guidance I kind of always walk through the sections that we talked about cost of revenues. I believe that this quarter is kind of our first full quarter. You got PPR and Resolve. You have the investments and research. So it will fluctuate a little bit, a couple of $100,000 here and there, depending on the headcount we move down to DC that might fluctuate that number a little bit, but I think you can view that as a fairly stabilized rate. At some point here, we will go back to having, right now there is no CPI increases in revenue, there is also no CPI increases for the staff but at some point, you know, between here and the end of the year or next year, I'm sure we will get to that. So eventually you will get back to a normalized environment where all your cost structure will go up by some CPI escalation number. Of course, that will be mainly offset by revenue. So I think you can look at that line which is the $21 million dollars, it is the majority of our cost structure is relatively stable now. So as you start dropping revenue from the top line, it will obviously drop right through the cost of sales and into the gross margin line. But as far as the other operating expenses go, again I gave pretty specific guidance on each one of those. I think the sales force, as Andy talked about, is relatively stable; it increased a lot over last year. So when you look at year-over-year and those numbers are going to look significant but when you look quarter-over-quarter, they only went up three. So that cost structure is going to be relatively stable, also again taking into account just some of the seasonality of things that we do like our annual sales conference or ICSC, those types of things. Development line, again that's actually pretty small number, it’s always in $4.5 million range plus or minus $300,000. That might increase slightly this year and we are doing some investments and development in Resolve and some other areas, but again it is not significant. And then in G&A, of course, that's the big number that you talked about obviously, you will definitely see a $2 million dollar saving as we go into next year as we eliminate some of these duplicative costs on headquarters. So I mean, all in all, I think as you get through this year, it’s a transition year, and you get to dropping revenues from the top line and the bottom line is going to start looking a lot more like it did back in 2007 and you’ve got to remember what business the model can do when you are in a normalized environment and I think we're pretty excited about that.
Brett Huff - Stephens: Okay. And then Andy, did you give new customer sites? I think you gave total new customer subs, but did you give sites?
Andy Florance: I thought it was about, off the top of my head about…
Brian Radecki: It was the same as usual. 
Andy Florance: About the same, I think it was 16,000 or so. So I can give you that exact number, it's about 16,000. It was pretty flat. New subscribing firms in quarter went from 423 in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 494 in the first quarter of 2010.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Wilson with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Again, thanks for all that demo I guess, two or three weeks ago. That was very helpful. I was wondering kind of out of, we talked a lot about cross selling and the distinct products of the three, and how powerful they are, which I agree from what I have seen. How about integration of them, and the process of it in the sense of being able to integrate the tools right inside a CoStar desktop of what PPR and Resolve offer, how long that will take, and how you see customer interest in that, or that some might be waiting for a kind of fully integrated desktop before they take the next step of paying you more money? How would you characterize that or outline it?
Andrew Florance: We have a big conference on the institutional side up in Cape Cod each year in the fall and our goal is to demonstrate some prototype product for that conference. We will not actually release that likely until beginning of 2011. And then for the Resolve integration what you are really trying to do there is take key variables used in valuing or reporting on the assets inside the portfolio and automate the flow of those variables from CoStar and PPR into Resolve. I think that will likely happen in 2011 and that is in the process, one of the things we are doing which we mentioned when we consolidated all these leases in Boston or we consolidated various leases, we are putting the people from Resolve in the same physical office space of the people from PPR and the people from CoStar, we are moving technical and analytic personnel up to Boston. So everyone is in one zone, so they can work as productively as possible on this integration effort which is fairly quantitative and hardcore. I don’t think we have a big issue where customers are waiting to see this happen. I think they get it, they understand why when you put these things together they will be pretty powerful, the integration is already occurring.  They are already seeing the number of comparable sales that go in for the analysis of valuation trends increase ten fold. So they are already seeing a benefit from it right now. I think there will be some things we look forward to getting past like when we change the forecast models, use a different data set and have to align the different index as you know, that will be something that happens within the next 12 months. But I think we’re already well on path and right now the IT organizations for CoStar and PPR are already integrated. So we’re already basically one group is already controlling the code for both organizations. It’s definitely easier than integrating a European and a US information set for instance.  
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley Research: Hi, thanks a lot. First just a housekeeping question. With net new customers of 1,265, any idea what the gross add number was? In other words, how many actual customers came online before you back out those who left? 
Andrew Florance: Yeah, I don’t think we are reporting that, we have just been reporting the net number, so we’d probably continue to report the net number moving forward but it would be probably be similar to our renewal rates so you could back into it if you wanted to.  
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley Research:  Okay. Got it.
Andrew Florance:  I am not sure what the number is.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley Research: Just trying to find out how many customers were added. Given that net adds declined sequentially, what would you say the reason for that was? It sounds like things are looking up a bit for the targeted customer base, with leasing activity picking up dramatically as you mentioned, so just trying to get a feel for why the net adds would decline? Is there some seasonality there?
Andrew Florance: It’s actually the mix is the issue. So again our organization is selling product that is $600 a year to subscribe to and simultaneously selling product that’s $1 million a year to subscribe to. So what happened between Q4 and Q1 was the mix changed. And so you had fewer of the low end sales and more of the high-end sales occurring. And that’s why it went from 17 something, 1700 net new adds to 1200 but got more organic growth. 
Brian Radecki: I think that you are going to continue to see that flip around all year long because of some of the things that Andy mentioned before. We are kind of selling barbells at the high end, and cross selling with PPR, but like as Andy mentioned, we are also introducing some new lower end service products in certain geographies this year. So just depending on when we release those, that mix could keep flipping all year. And it will change based on for example, we had 20 sales people being repositioned and retrained for a new product area and so if those folks go online are being transitioned to the new product initiative, you got a brief pause in low end sales on another product area. So it will be a little bumpy that way but the overall revenue result will be fairly predictable.
Andrew Florance: Yeah I think that’s right and Vance is that that could flip back and forth based on the initiative that we have going at lower end product or higher end product, but ultimately as we produce organic revenue growth, that’s really the end result.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Got it and that also covers what would have been my next question on the customer profile. Maybe one last one for you. The acquisition pipeline, anything you can comment on? Are you looking for more M&A out there?
Andy Florance: We definitely are. We think that there are still opportunities out there we are interested in. We are actively and continuously out there talking to people and looking for things, so I would not say that shut down are over. It’s just a question of timing and when something we like comes up and we are probably walking away from 4 out of 5 deals because we don’t like the valuation So Vance and anyone listening out there, we are still very interested. It’s andy@costar.com or brian@costar.com. We would love to chat if you are reasonable on valuation.
Operator:  We have no more further questions, please continue.
Andrew Florance: Okay at this point I would like to thank everyone for joining us for the Q1 earnings call update and I hope you appreciate that I kept my comments down to nine pages. I look forward to talk to you again in the second quarter. Bye, bye

Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to CoStar Group's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have CoStar's President and CEO, Andrew Florance; and Chief Financial Officer, Brian Radecki; and Communication Director, Tim Trainor. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Trainor. Please go ahead.
Tim Trainor: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to CoStar Group's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Before I turn the call over to CoStar's President and CEO, Andrew Florance, let me state that certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar's third quarter 2009 press release and CoStar's filings with the SEC, including CoStar's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and CoStar's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements.  A webcast of this conference call is available on our website at www.costar.com/investors.aspx. Thank you again for joining us. I'll now turn the call over to Andy.
Andy Florance: Thank you, Tim. I appreciate it. Welcome, everyone to CoStar Group's third quarter 2009 conference call. I'm very pleased once again to report that CoStar Group completed another profitable quarter with a strong performance of 4.3 million in earnings. Third quarter 2009 EBITDA was 10.6 million. Revenues for the third quarter were 53.6 million, a 7% quarterly increase from 50.1 million in the second quarter of 2009. As a result of the strong fundamentals of our core business, CoStar continues to generate consistent profits and enjoy a very healthy and secure financial position despite the current weakness in the commercial real estate markets. In fact, we believe that we are seeing a marked improvement in our business fundamentals currently. As we noted in our press release issued yesterday, we saw fewer cancellations this past quarter, a significant improvement in our organic revenue growth, and our renewal rate increased in the third quarter over the second quarter. Perhaps, more importantly, the company's outlook going into the fourth quarter is for continued improvement in these areas. Clearly, we are still operating in a down market. However, these positive trends and a number of other positive market indicators that I will discuss later in the call lead us to believe that a potential recovery may be in sight. The value placed on our information by subscribers has always separated CoStar from competitors, and we believe it remains the chief reason why CoStar Group has continued to enjoy high renewal rates and generate strong earnings and cash flow through the whole recession. And we fully expect the company will continue to do so. We added 10.2 million to our balance sheet during the third quarter and our cash balances now exceed [$0.25 billion]. Our total cash, cash equivalents and investments on-hand totaled 253.9 million, and the majority of these assets held in cash are invested in U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government money market funds. Also contributing to our strong financial position is the fact that the company has no long-term debt. I would like to tell you more about the acquisition, we announced earlier this week of Resolve Technology, a leading provider of business intelligence and portfolio management software, primarily serving institutional real estate investors. This is the second company we have acquired in the past 90 days or so. I will also provide an update on our earlier acquisition, Property and Portfolio Research, which CoStar acquired in July. Last quarter, I announced our intent to expand CoStar Group's platform and create additional growth opportunities by selectively acquiring successful companies that we believe can leverage our extensive data, strong balance sheet, and highly effective sales channel in ways that we - that can enhance the value of our services to subscribers and generate significant future revenue. Since then, we have continued to take advantage of what we see as an excellent opportunity in the current environment to acquire companies at reasonable valuations. As in the case of PPR, we believe Resolve Technology is a company with exceptional products that we can - with which we can achieve accelerated revenue growth by leveraging CoStar's strategic assets. We couldn't be happier to have an innovative thinker like Resolve's Founder and CEO, Eric Forman, and his very impressive team joined CoStar. We look forward to working alongside with him and his talented staff of approximately 17 product managers, developers and customer service professionals. The Resolve team is very enthusiastic about our potential as a combined company, and we completely share that enthusiasm. Based in Needham, Mass., just outside of Boston, Resolve's clients include many of the world's leading real estate advisory and investment management firms, REITs, life insurance companies, pension funds, including such names as Boston Properties, Bentall Capital, Kimco Realty, LaSalle Investment Management, Principal Global Investors, Prudential Financial, and UBS to name just a few. Many of these firms are CoStar customers already for our data products and a smaller number are customers for PPR currently. These investment managers have large complex real estate portfolios and use Resolve software to integrate data contained in numerous disconnected systems and countless Excel spreadsheets into a useful centralized information dashboard and reporting tool and what a scenario engine. I just returned last night from Resolve's user conference. It was very informative and really quite motivating. Among some of the presentations, we heard Doug Pritchard, VP of Information Systems from Kennedy Associates, talk to be Resolve customers about how he uses the request platform to collect information from the various accounting systems and property management systems and Argus systems to present their investors with detailed information on how the various commercial real estate assets are performing in their portfolio. Doug feels that this will give Kennedy Associates a significant advantage in drawing additional capital into their organization and clients because of the transparency they can give their limited partner investors.  We also heard from [Jay Silvia], who is VP of Portfolio Reporting from New Boston Fund. Because of FASB regulations, he was challenged with the requirement to mark-to-market over 500 commercial real estate loans in a very short time period. He turned to Resolve's product portfolio Maximizer. He got KPMG's buy-in on the calculations used within the portfolio Maximizer, and they were able to meet their requirement to mark-to-market 504 loans ahead of schedule. Now in the case of the first gentlemen, Doug Pritchard, he actually is a CoStar customer and he puts a lot of work and effort into producing market reports around the properties they have invested in and putting that up into their request engine that their customers will log into. He was thrilled with the concept that through this acquisition that whole process would become automated and happen automatically. Any time you can thrill a customer, who is doing something manual like that with an automation you're growing a potential customer base. So, in addition to automatically consolidating historical budget, pro forma, financial and property information from various real estate investments, Resolve's analysis tools also tie together information related to assets, debt and partnerships giving investors added clarity on their impact on performance and returns. Investors can also use Resolve's software to apply different what-if scenarios for analyzing the impact on the forecast performance of their investments. They can be used to develop strategies to optimize the performance of their real estate portfolios.  We believe that CoStar's and PPR's tools can become much more valuable when integrated with Resolve software and vice versa. We intend to move quickly to make all this happen. Let me offer a quick example of how we believe this combination will enhance the value of each service. Resolve's tools have always made it easy for a client to quickly identify properties within their portfolio that have a higher risk concentration of, say, lease expirations within a specific market in a given year. But what it could not tell you from an independent third-party source was whether or not that lease rollover exposure was likely to result in lower or higher net operating incomes for these individual properties. This is where CoStar's market information and forecast from PPR real estate economists can provide valuable context that these investors can use to quickly make much more informed decisions. They can look at an asset and say, these lease rollovers are likely to result in significant lower NOIs or higher NOIs, and act accordingly, before you'd have to really dig into it and do research, call brokers, do whatever you'd have to do to try to understand the truth. Once the CoStar and PPR data is integrated, a client using Resolve's analysis price will be able to better analyze and understand how current and forecasted market conditions affect their portfolio. Is the amount of available space forecasted to increase or decrease in their buildings? Are current market rents higher or lower than expiring rents? Are competitive properties in the same market leasing up quickly or not at all? We believe this enhanced capability will be invaluable for institutional investors with larger, complex portfolios in a whole lot of different property types spread over many different markets. Our goal is to provide investors with the ability to analyze opportunities, manage risk and evaluate their real estate portfolios with speed and precision using technology on par with what investors use to analyze and valuate stock and bond investment portfolios. And we believe that the Resolve acquisition, together with our previously announced acquisition of PPR, offers a tremendous up-sell opportunity for hundreds of CoStar clients with sizable real estate investments. We have some development work ahead of us, no doubt, to bring all this capability to reality, but we believe we can use this valuable research to help us further penetrate and expand our presence in this important higher-end segment. This was a strategic decision to acquire a company that helps us capture this huge opportunity, and we believe that ultimately it will support long-term earnings growth. We have a robust pipeline of additional potential strategic acquisitions that we believe offers similar growth opportunities. For more than 20 years, CoStar has focused on expanding our research and market coverage to offer the most comprehensive source of commercial real estate information. Now, having largely completed our coverage of domestic U.S. markets, we are increasingly focused on helping our subscribers to do more with the enormous amount of valuable information we provide to them. We believe that providing additional value-added tools and resources for accessing and analyzing commercial real estate information will not only enhance CoStar's value for existing clients, but also appeal to potential new subscribers in other real estate and investment sectors, ultimately expanding the overall market for CoStar services. As I previously mentioned, the integration of PPR has been going extremely well. I attended the PPR client conference two weeks ago and had the privilege of meeting a great many of the firm's clients, including senior level executives from several major banks, real estate funds and pension funds. To a person, every one I spoke with said that they recognize the tremendous potential in the combination of CoStar and PPR. They see the value in bringing together the strengths of each representative firm and having access to a single source of reliable granular and 35,000 square foot information in one stop. They feel this will help them in their needs for real estate information, market analysis, credit risk analysis and forecasting needs. We are also beginning to see real significant cross-selling opportunities emerge in the PPR acquisition. In the first three months, we have already signed three large PPR, CoStar cross-sell deals. These are deals that we do not think would have happened if the merger had not occurred, and we believe there are a lot more deals where that came from. Projected sales and revenue from the acquisition are currently running ahead of plan, and I'm very pleased by the interest we're seeing in cross-sold products so far. Let's turn to commercial real estate market conditions. Conditions across most commercial real estate markets remained [appressed] in the third quarter, but a small number of significant small positive indicators and trends are just beginning to emerge. These indicators may signal an approaching bottom and a not-too-distant recovery. Despite increasing prospects for recovery, the reality remains that pervasive job losses have triggered a sharp decline in demand for all types of commercial space, resulting in negative absorption, increasing vacancy rates, falling rents, and falling NOIs, and falling property values.  Office leasing activity is off approximately 20% from year-ago levels and all but three of the core U.S. office markets that CoStar tracks posted negative absorption over the first three quarters of 2009. Based on historical trends, it will take up to two years for the office market to recover from pervasive job losses. The U.S. office market had an average office vacancy rate of 13% at the end of the third quarter. Based on the number of job losses, the negative absorption, CoStar is forecasting the average U.S. office vacancy rate to increase to 16% before sustained widespread job growth and the company demand for space returns in 2011 and 2012, timeframe. Office vacancy will decline just after that. Given that it will take time before the impact from an economic recovery leads to increases in commercial real estate rents, overleveraged building owners will likely operate in a negative operating income environment, leading to significantly more widespread loan defaults. As a result, I believe we can expect to see an REO cycle likely lasting through 2012. If this were to happen, we believe that it would generate additional interest in CoStar's products. First, we expect there'll be tremendous demand for accurate and comprehensive information on commercial real estate properties and asset sales among major institutions, lenders, value-add and opportunity investors, foreign investors, CMBS special services, and others seeking to establish commercial property values in this new environment. So this is similar to what [Jay Silva] was doing at New Boston Fund and named quickly mark-to-market hundreds and hundreds of commercial properties. We believe this is a large potential market for CoStar. Secondly, we will likely see a wave of new ownership in place following this REO cycle. They too can benefit from access to CoStar's real estate information. On the sales side, we're seeing some initial signs of improvement in the economy, and it's reflected in our sales this past quarter. In addition to stronger-than-expected organic revenue growth, our total subscriber counts, average contract value and the annualized net bookings were all up during the third quarter. Taken together, we believe the overall sales activity points to some sign of recovery. As I said earlier, we are also very encouraged by the fact that the positive trends we saw this past quarter appear to be carrying over into the fourth quarter where we have some visibility. During the quarter, we added 874 new subscribers. I want to say it one more time because it's been a while since I've been able to say the word “added”. During the quarter, we added 874 new subscribers for a total of 83,620 at the end of the third quarter, up from 82,746 at the end of the second quarter.  Also, the renewal rate in the third quarter was 84%, a 1% increase over the prior renewal rate of 83%. Renewal rates among customers who have CoStar for more than five years remained at approximately 89%.  So to put this in context, this is the first quarter in which we've seen an increase in renewal rates since the fourth quarter of 2006. This is the first quarter that we’ve seen an increase in subscriber count and that subscriber count number I’m giving you excludes PPR. It does includes PPR?
Brian Radecki: Organic is up too.
Andy Florance: Okay. So it’s up organic and it’s up with PPR. So it’s the first increase in subscriber count on an organic basis since the third quarter of 2008. In addition, the average new contract value among our U.S. site subscription sales also increased to 7,878 in the third quarter compared with 7,497 at the end of the previous quarter. Our annualized net bookings, although still negative, showed a quarterly improvement of $3.17 million. This reflects the positive impact of an increase in our overall gross sales coupled with a slowing pace of reversals and contract write-downs. We are seeing a turnaround in our sales in some of those markets that went into the down cycle first. In Orange County, California, for example, which was the epicenter of the financial meltdown, we’re now seeing very strong sales, positive overall revenue growth. That market led the country in leasing activity as a percentage of total inventory in the third quarter of this year. As this cycle continues, we expect to see an increase in office leasing activity among more markets as rents adjust, which of course is a welcome good news for brokerage firms, which then we believe could translate into more sales for CoStar Group. So there’s something of a rental capitulation creating volume, creating additional commissions, creating sales for us. Another sign that the cycle may be turning is the interest we’re seeing from former customers in becoming subscribers again. Many of these former clients canceled out of necessity. They simply had no cash flow. Others perhaps tried using competitive services to cut costs but found the quality of information to be wanting and provided much less value than the CoStar services. I expect we will see a number of former subscribers rejoin us as their businesses recover and they once again need and can afford reliable data. Having seen these positive trends in our sales activity after what we hope was to have been the bottom of the sales cycle over the past - the first two quarters of this year, we added a number of new sales reps to take the total number of sales reps to 192 on staff at the end of the third quarter. Our increased sales headcount at the end of the third quarter consist of 128 U.S. subscription sales reps, seven U.S. advertising sales reps, 30 in-house sales reps, five PPR sales reps, and 22 U.K. field sales reps. Included in the PPR sales team, this is an increase of 48 salespeople since the end of the last year and an increase of 32 since the third - since the second quarter of 2009. So we have basically grown our sales force by 33% since the beginning of this year. Although, this increase in headcount had a negative impact on this quarter’s earnings, from the trends we’ve seen this past quarter, we believe it will be advantageous to increase sales headcount ahead of the increased sales opportunity we expect among our core subscribers who stand to be among the first to benefit when the economy stabilizes and leasing and sales activity resume. We signed a major renewal this past quarter with Studley, the leading global tenant advisory firm, which became the largest - latest major commercial real estate services provider to expand its access to CoStar’s entire U.S. database of property listings and tenant information. The renewal represented a net fee increase for more services provided. Turning to our research efforts, our research team continues to do an outstanding job in researching all of the buildings and markets CoStar covers. Over the past year, the total number of commercial real estate properties in CoStar’s database grew 15% from approximately 3.058 million in the third quarter of 2008 to approximately 3.522 million in the third quarter of 2009. For sale properties valued at more than 519 billion were favorable in CoStar’s database at the end of the third quarter. In total, between both our U.S. and international operations at the end of the third quarter, the company had approximately 1.35 million active listings in its database. The information available in CoStar represents the largest aggregation of commercial property information ever assembled within a research database system anywhere in the world and offers tremendous value for our subscribers. Also this past quarter, our research team expanded our CoStar COMPS and CoStar Tenant services, bringing CoStar’s full suite of information services to every market in the U.S. We have already begun to capture additional revenue from the expanded offerings. To handle this expanding coverage, we added more than - or almost several dozen part-time researchers and more than 30 full-time researchers. We believe that we will realize a significant ROI on this investment as we sell to more new clients and cross-sell existing clients in these enhanced markets. Already this past quarter, CoStar continued to invest in and released enhanced versions of our products. We have recently released two upgrades to our CoStar COMPS and Property Professional products, providing subscribers with even more expanded capabilities for conducting in-depth analysis and reporting on trends in sales and leasing activity using the CoStar dataset. The new features include seamless access for CoStar Property users and CoStar COMPS users to all 93 analytic charts available for displaying trend data in CoStar Analytics from a single set of search results. Subscribers can now easily switch from analyzing sales information for a selection of buildings to accessing key leasing performance measures for the same set of buildings without performing a separate query. This allows the user to really be able to look at the interacting dynamics of their driving leasing sales and get a better understanding of their markets. After using the CoStar COMPS Analytics search option to analyze the average price per square foot and average cap rate for all Class A office buildings sold in San Diego in 2009, for example, a subscriber can quickly analyze the same set of buildings using any of the CoStar Property Analytics search options such as average rental rates, time on market, occupancy and percent leased. In addition, subscribers can now use CoStar’s Analytic capabilities to identify buyers, sellers, brokers and lenders with significant commercial real estate sales. The new company view identifies the firms involved in building sales. Subscribers can quickly identify and compare the top buyers, top sellers, top listing brokers, top buyer-brokers ranked by overall sales volume or by the number of sales transactions. You can imagine, if I were trying to dispose of a property, knowing who is active - who the most active buyers are for that type of property and my reach in the company - country would be extremely valuable to me. I can basically look for similar properties in similar geography, get a list of the top 10 buyers and go pursue them to see if they want to buy my property. The new expanded CoStar Analytic platform includes several new reporting options, including sales volume by buyer type and sales transactions by a buyer type, providing additional intelligence in the types of firms that are most active in the market, such as REITs, institutions or individuals. Again, this gives me the ability to develop a strategy for who is most likely to want to buy my property. In providing these enhancements, our goal is to offer subscribers additional insight and clarity on changing market conditions, helping our clients conduct the type of thorough analysis needed to identify investment opportunities, manage risk more effectively, and forecast future investment and leasing performance. With these and additional analytic tools enhancements, we plan to bring to the market, CoStar’s committed to delivering additional value to our subscribers by providing even more ways to analyze and interpret the vast amounts of data we provide. In conclusion today, we are seeing some clear signs of renewed strength in our business. We are seeing improving organic revenue, higher renewal rates, and increasing subscriber counts for the first time this year and really since last year. We are excited at the prospect of integrating CoStar’s industry-leading research and property data with Resolve Technology’s advanced software and PPR analytic and forecasting capabilities. And we believe the combination of our three firms will generate significant future revenue and earnings growth for CoStar. We believe the fact that we have continued to generate strong earnings during this down market, not only reflects the strong fundamentals of our business, but also the hard determined work and dedication of all of our employees. At this point, I will turn the call over to Brian Radecki, our CFO, for a more in-depth discussion of our quarterly financial performance and outlook. I can’t wait to hear what you have to say, Brian.
Brian Radecki: Thank you, Andy. As Andy mentioned, we are pleased to report CoStar achieved solid financial results for the third quarter of 2009, and we saw a marked improvement in many areas of our business. Today, I’m going to focus principally on sequential results for the third quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter and also on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2009. As we progress through the current economic and commercial real estate cycle, we believe sequential trends offer the most insight into the performance of our business. Our Q3 revenues came in stronger than anticipated at 53.6 million, which was above our guidance range, and increased 3.5 million over the second quarter of 2009. Our favorable revenue performance during the quarter was directly related to the prorated acquisition of PPR at 3.8 million, which was substantially higher than expected, and a noticeable stabilization of our organic revenues, which only declined 240,000 in Q3, representing a significantly smaller decline than the average of the prior two quarters, which was over $1 million. Q3 subscription revenues accounted for 95.1% of our total revenues. On a functional currency basis, the international revenue stabilized at £2.9 million in the third quarter of 2009 and is flat compared to the second quarter. This is a positive sign that recovery may be near in the U.K. International revenues were 8.9% of the company’s total revenues in the third quarter and 88.4% of those were subscription-based. Our 12-month trailing renewal rate, which is a measure of renewing subscription revenue, was 84.6% or approximately 85%. While I publicly stated for nearly two years that we expect the 12-month trailing renewal rate to decline to the low to mid 80s for the calendar year 2009 and then begin to recover next year, we have now seen our in-quarter renewal rate improve, putting us ahead of our expectations. The positive trend we’re seeing in renewal rates directly contributed to the increased subscribers and stabilization we saw in organic revenues and also translated into improved DSOs and lower bad debt during Q3. Moving to gross margin, gross margin was 34.4 million in Q3 of 2009. The gross margin percentage decreased to 64.3% in Q3 from 66.6% in Q2 of 2009, mainly due to the impact of PPR’s comparatively lower gross margins and some investments in research which we discussed prior. Moving down the income statement, total operating expenses in the third quarter of 2009 were 27.5 million compared to 25.1 million in the second quarter of 2009. PPR added approximately 1.6 million in these operating expenses, as expected. And as Andy mentioned, we invested in the sales force during the Q3 to take advantage of our recent enhancements in a more positive selling environment by adding 32 people in the quarter. In addition, we incurred approximately 500,000 of acquisition-related costs, as expected, and approximately 160,000 in costs related to a write-off of a lease. Finally, the third quarter 2009 operating expenses included legal costs of approximately 1.3 million, which were about 300,000 higher than expected. As you are aware, we are currently involved in a number of lawsuits and could be involved in others aimed at protecting our intellectual property rights. Turning to profitability, our third quarter 2009 net income was 4.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, and our EBITDA for the quarter was 10.6 million. Reconciliation of EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the GAAP basis results shown in detail in our press release issued yesterday. The press release is available on our website at www.costar.com. Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2009 with approximately 253.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, an increase of 10.2 million since June 30, 2009 and the company has no long-term debt. Now, I’ll move my remarks to the outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2009. As is typical, our guidance takes into account recent revenue growth rates and our results that may be impacted by the surrounding global economy. We’re confident in our earnings guidance and believe one of the strengths of the subscription-based model is it provides solid earnings guidance and cash flow visibility. Just to remind everybody, our guidance for the fourth quarter includes prorated projections for the Resolve deal we just closed. The Resolve transaction resulted in an initial cash payment of approximately $2.9 million, which excludes the hold-back for purchase adjustments, and approximately 26,000 of restricted shares locked up for three years. Although Resolve has estimated revenues of approximately 3.6 million for 2009, we expect fourth quarter revenue from the Resolve acquisition to be much smaller than normal expected due to the purchase accounting rules for deferred revenue. Under GAAP accounting rules, deferred revenue for software licenses or maintenance agreements where clients have paid Resolve in advance would normally amortize in the recognized revenue over the term of the license or maintenance period. However, under purchase accounting rules, the deferred revenue on the Resolve balance sheet at the closing gets revalued based on actual costs remaining to complete the service. In the case of software licenses and maintenance, unlike our reoccurring information services, the ongoing cost is minimal. Therefore, the purchase accounting and deferred revenue that is carried over is also minimal and we will not get to recognize the revenue from the amortization of deferred revenue of approximately $1 million. As a result, acquired revenue for Resolve is expected to be lowered by $1 million over the next 12 to 15 months with the impact being most significant in Q4 of 2009. It is important to note that the accounting treatment affects the reported revenues but does not alter our expectation of future cash flows or our IRR projections for the Resolve acquisition. As we have stated in our earnings release, we expect Resolve to be dilutive by approximately $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter due to the revenue recognition issue, deal-related costs, purchase amortization, equity compensation, and other costs related to the acquisition. These costs will have very little Resolve revenue to offset them in the fourth quarter. As new sales are made and cash is collected, the deferred revenue and subsequent quarterly revenue is expected to build back up over the next year. We expect the fourth quarter 2009 revenue for the company in the range of 53 to 54 million and approximately 208 to 209 million of revenue for the full year, as we expect to see positive trends on the sales side of the business continue. We expect total cost of revenues to be approximately 19.5 to 20 million in Q4, which will include the additional prorated costs for the Resolve acquisition. Moving down the P&L, we expect total selling and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of approximately 11.8 to 12.3 million, software development of approximately four million, and G&A of approximately 11.5 million in the fourth quarter. In terms of purchase accounting, we expect total purchase amortization of approximately two million in the fourth quarter, inclusive of the acquisition of Resolve with approximately 800,000 allocated to cost of revenues and 1.2 million allocated to operating expenses. As we continue to invest internationally, the mechanics of our effective tax rate calculation continue to be affected by the amount of income or loss in the U.K. entities. The tax expense or benefit from the U.K. operations is not equivalent to the tax rate of our U.S. operations, which can have an impact on the overall blended rate. As CoStar utilize all of its NOLs, in the third quarter of 2009, we made an entity classification election with some of our U.K. entities to roll them under the U.S. group for tax purposes, which provided us a small benefit in Q3, about $0.01 of EPS, while our overall rate for the year remains at 44%. In addition, this election may bring down our overall effective rate next year and more importantly save the company tens of millions of dollars in actual cash tax savings over the next five to seven years. I view the fact that we are able to utilize this benefit from a book perspective, coupled with the potential actual cash tax savings, is a huge, huge, positive to investors who would and should be extremely excited about this. In terms of earnings, we expect fourth quarter 2009 fully diluted net income per share of approximately 0.16 to $0.19 on approximately 20.3 million of fully diluted outstanding shares. For the year 2009, we expect fully diluted net income of approximately 0.92 to 0.95. Just to remind everybody, our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year outlook has been reduced by $0.03 per share related to the prorated estimates for the Resolve deal which we just closed and I just discussed. As Andy explained earlier, we are very excited about the future growth opportunities from the combination of CoStar, PPR, and Resolve. We are looking past the short-term financial impact of the acquisitions and expect them to create significant high revenue and margin growth opportunities moving forward as we address a very, very large opportunity. I understand these types of deals with one-time expenses, or non-operating accounting charges, makes it a little harder to understand, therefore I’m considering some additional disclosures next year to help investors more easily evaluate the core operations. Also, our full year guidance includes approximately 6.9 million in pre-tax non-cash equity compensation charges related to the vesting of restricted stock and stock option grants. We also made - continue to consolidate or move some of our office space over the next year to save money and take advantage of upgraded space at much lower cost, which sometimes create one-time gains or losses for the company, just as we have in the past. These charges are not factored into our normal operations, in our outlook, and in our numbers. Our business model remains strong based on the fact that we have a 95% subscription-based business with high renewal rates, a unique proprietary database, a market-leading position, strong balance sheet, no debt and extremely high cash flow. We expect to return to a more normalized revenue growth rates and expanding margins we have enjoyed over the past decade in the near future as we continue to see positive trends in our business and the overall economy. CoStar management team believes there is significant opportunity for additional high-margin revenue growth following the investments we’ve made in research and sales and the strategic acquisitions like PPR and Resolve. We continue to look forward to reporting that progress to you, and with that, I open up the call for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). And first we’ll go to the line of John Neff with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Neff - William Blair:  Hey, guys.
Andy Florance:  Hi, John. How are you doing?
John Neff - William Blair:  Good. A couple of questions here for you just a little bit on the PPR acquisition, any impact there on the retention rates that you reported? In other words, is that an organic number?
Andy Florance:  Yes. The retention rate is all organic. It doesn’t factor anything from the PPR’s deal.
Brian Radecki:  And the PPR deal, just on a side note is almost - they’re running almost at the identical numbers that we are. So it is pretty much identical.
John Neff - William Blair:  Right. The tax rate, Brian, just a little more detail there, is it now - I think of the U.K. as having a lower corporate tax rate than the United States. So is it suddenly advantageous to have some of the U.K. operations in the U.S. tax jurisdiction? Is that an indictment of future U.K. profitability? And is this change permanent? In other words, what sort of effective tax rate can we expect perhaps even next year?
Brian Radecki:  Sure. We’re not giving guidance on next year, but as we all know, in taxes nothing is permanent. The tax rules change daily. But what I can say is that, if you look at how we utilized - we utilized almost $100 million of NOLs over the history of the company. When we just completed that I was told by several tax partners that we were one of the few public companies that actually utilize all of their NOLs. We’re now taking advantage of utilizing the NOLs over in the U.K. from the losses there by moving that entity under the U.S. for tax purposes. So it’s not - it doesn’t give any indication of what plans are internationally, but it’s just allowing us to utilize those now because you don’t have profits in the U.K. where you can utilize those NOLs at those lower rates that you have. So you are able to utilize them now to offset higher U.S. tax rates. So this is a tax planning strategy. It’s a small benefit in the quarter but, to me, the more exciting thing is the possible cash tax savings we’re going to have over the next five to seven years from this, which is real.
John Neff - William Blair:  So, I mean five to seven years, for all practical purposes, fairly permanent?
Brian Radecki:  If you want to call that permanent.
John Neff - William Blair:  Okay, foreseeable future?
Brian Radecki:  For the foreseeable future, I like that better.
Andy Florance:  That wouldn’t be permanent [in marriages].
Brian Radecki:  I think every time I say permanent, I think I said something about the tax rate will go down. People are going to pull my comment from two years ago and then we had an $8 million gain and the tax rate went down. So I try to avoid saying permanent and will not do this because things happen in the business which sometimes changes. But this is another way of us utilizing and saving more cash, which should be important to investors. It should be a positive.
John Neff - William Blair:  Yeah. But one thing you had mentioned, that you quantified it as a $0.01 per share benefit in the quarter. Last quarter, you had guided to 45 to 47% effective tax rate, so I guess I think of it - at 40% that’s about $0.03 benefit in the quarter. Is that incorrect?
Brian Radecki:  No. It’s about 44% for the year if you look at the annualized year rate and you take the difference between the annualized and the in-quarter, it’s about $0.01, $0.015, somewhere around there.
John Neff - William Blair:  Okay. Then a question for you on Resolve, how is that solution deployed? Is that client/server, or is that software as a service? I’m trying to think - are there any data advantages that accrue to you, given how Resolve solutions combine a client’s internal as well as external data?
Andy Florance:  It’s actually - you can imagine this is the crown jewels of proprietary data for these customers. So the solutions are - I mean so it’s a series of web reporting tools, but it’s all deployed inside the client’s firewall and we get no data benefit from their data that’s in the Resolve platform. And similar to the tax situation though, nothing is permanent. It does open up the possibility that sometime down the road at the client’s choosing, they may decide to share and benchmark data back and forth amongst each other. This would create a systems infrastructure that would make that fairly straightforward and inexpensive to do. The real value is the fact that if I’ve got 1,000 investment grade office properties in 400 different sub markets in the United States, integrating the details of my internal property management system, lease administration system, accounting system, budgeting and forecasting system with CoStar data, the benefit is extraordinary. Being able to basically have a third-party independent automated valuation function for your assets and get a rolling daily independent third-party view potentially down the road of your loan-to-value ratios and your equity and so and so is phenomenal. So it’s got a lot of potential.
John Neff - William Blair:  And last question just --
Andy Florance:  It is dilutive in the first quarter though.
John Neff - William Blair:  Last question, I just want to --
Andy Florance:  On an accounting basis, I’m sorry.
John Neff - William Blair:  A showcase update and jut how - any sense of the annualized run rate there? And also give us an update on - you mentioned you have got 1.35 million listings on - across CoStar’s entire platform currently. What percentage of those are you allowing to be in Showcase? How many listings available in Showcase versus your overall universe? Thanks very much.
Brian Radecki:  Sure. On the 1.35 million listings, I don’t have the precise numbers with me. We do have caps on what we’re proactively selling in the various sub markets and markets. And I believe we are below those caps. I think Anchorage, Alaska sold out. I think half of the listings and literally half of the listings in Anchorage showed up on Showcase. And so we maxed out in that market. We stop selling new ones. But it is still probably less than 15% of the listings are moving through Showcase. So we don’t believe there is any cannibalization occurring there. One of the models for that product was our company up in Scotland, SPN. They have a Showcase-like product, which has 85% of the listings in Scotland up on it and yet they still have all the major brokerage firms subscribing to the information product. So I don’t think we’re anywhere near any sort of substitution effect. And what I will do is I will try to come back and give you a briefing next quarter on how things are going at Showcase. It’s going fine, it’s going well, and we’ll prepare some more detailed remarks in next quarter’s earnings call for it.
John Neff - William Blair:  Great. Thank you very much.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, John.
Operator:  And next we will go to the line of Jon Maietta with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Hey, thanks very much. Hi, guys.
Andy Florance:  Hey. How are you doing, Jon.
Brian Radecki:  Hey, Jon.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Good. So strategically, I just want to make sure, I’m not missing anything in that, with these past couple of acquisitions, you’ve effectively extended the value of the database, number one. I think, number two, you’ve done a good job of what I see a lot of consulting organizations do in that you’ve chased the dollars where they are being spent today. And three, I’m just wondering is there anything else? Does this help you put up a defensive wall against competition potentially or --?
Andy Florance:  Sure. This is a way to accelerate our move into value for institutional large-scale financial organizations, which is absolutely a - something that represents a barrier to competitive entry. So we think that, with 20 some years of experience, you look at the various people involved in these different companies, myself, Eric Forman, Bret Wilkerson. We’ve all been in this business serving institutional clients for 10, 20-plus years. So working together, we can build some very compelling products for the institutional world that right now has got intense information requirements on revaluing assets, deciding on what they’re going to dispose, what they’re going to acquire and giving them real-world solutions to integrate their proprietary internal data with the best forecasting available - the best data available. And I think that represents a huge competitive advantage. And this is a difficult step to replicate. If you look - if you sit through a day-long presentation of the Resolve portfolio, maximize their software like I did on Monday, you would come to appreciate that this is not some build it this week and off to the races you go. This is extraordinarily complex, sophisticated software we’re talking about here. So I think it would take a lot of time to rebuild this stuff.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Andy, just to piggyback off of John’s question with regard to Resolve and potentially exchanging data with that platform at some point, would that require you to rewrite the platform? Could we potentially see a software as a service offering at some point?
Andy Florance:  Well, absolutely. We could provide this and we could have spin-offs that are software as a service. In fact, we’ve discussed that. So there are a lot of derivative products that are possible. But in terms of the access and the client data, that data, it’s utmost importance to us and Resolve that that data is completely secure, confidential inside their firewall; it’s their data. It only be - because those clients, who actually are a pretty active user group, get together and want to do some benchmarking, assuring that day that we would do that, that we’d ever be having that discussion about their data. But should that occur, it would be real easy to do. So should they decide to push something outside the firewall, they are all in the same - because of Resolve, they are all in the same data structure. We’ve actually mapped out all of the charts of accounts from all kinds of disparate accounting systems and disparate property management systems, and it would be very straightforward to create benchmarking that could be extremely useful to them.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Interesting, okay.
Andy Florance:  Again that’s completely their choice.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Got it. Okay. What does the Resolve - the typical Resolve sales cycle look like? Is it six to nine months? Is it three months or --?
Andy Florance:  It’s probably six to 12 months. It’s fairly - I mean, this is something that goes throughout an organization. It has a one year plus implementation cycle for the higher-end product. They do have a lower entry-level or a more entry-level product which is an out of the box low cost implementation product, but generally it’s a pretty extensive implementation.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Okay. And then Brian, with regard to gross margins, should we expect kind of a similar margin going forward for the next couple of quarters or so? Or how do you think about that?
Brian Radecki:  Yes, I think so. It might have a slight downtick when you add in the Resolve but in general you’re at about the level that you’re going to be at for a few quarters.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Okay. And then do you happen to have the figure for stock compensation in the quarter?
Brian Radecki:  Sure, yeah. It has been running at about 1.5 million or 1.6 million a quarter. It is about two million in Q3, which a lot of that is what we disclosed as far as the acquisitions of PPR and it will probably be running at about two, 2.1 in the fourth quarter with Resolve.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Company:  Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks Jon.
Operator:  And next we’ll go to the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc:  Good morning and congrats on the Resolve deal.
Brian Radecki:  Thank you, Brett.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc:  A quick question, I want to make sure that I understand the internal growth trends going on. So can I just do a - some quick back-of-the-envelope math, trying to understand exactly what the Resolve impact will be for 4Q, Brian? If I take the midpoint of your guidance, which is 53.5 and take out - should I take out 3.8 for PPR in 4Q to get to an organic number? Is that the right estimate?
Brian Radecki:  Yeah, it will be plus or minus around there.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc:  Okay. And then how much - I try to kind of do your math on Resolve, which is - I took the 3.6 million and took away the $1 million of deferred revenue and then tried to kind of prorate it for the amount that you guys will own it for Q4 and got a couple of hundred thousand dollars and that gets me to 49.5 of organic revenue. Is that a reasonable way to go at it?
Brian Radecki:  Yeah. I mean I didn’t put a number on the Resolve, but I agree it will be a couple of hundred thousand. It will be very minimal in the fourth quarter, and then that will grow back up to kind of that 3.5 to $4 million rate next year as we sell those and book them in deferreds.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc:  Okay. I just want to make sure that compares then to the - so that is 49.5 by my math, whether it is right or wrong, to 49.8 this quarter. So that tells me your organic growth, to your point, will be - declines will - that we’ve seen sequentially have moderated meaningfully and that’s what you’re saying when you’re seeing these trends continue. Is that right?
Brian Radecki:  Exactly, exactly. I think we’re still seeing a lot of positive trends and we would expect to see those positive trends through the fourth quarter. And I think that’s why the Resolve deal, not only with deal cost is so dilutive in the fourth quarter is because you have no revenue to really support their cost structure because of accounting reasons. But again, for cash flow purposes, it’s nonexistent.
Andy Florance:  Brett, you should be writing some of our scripts.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc:  Okay. I just want to make sure I get the organic in the right way. Andy, I think maybe this is a question for you. On the net adds, I think you said you gave us an add number of 873. Is that gross or net? And do you have a gross number if it’s not?
Andy Florance:  That is net and I don’t have a gross number right here. That would take some work.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc:  And then just in terms of - can you give us a little bit more detail or color on - you gave an example of why people aren't canceling now. Can you give us a sense of what they're saying when they re-sign up? Is it brokers who are saying okay, life is not as bad as it used to be, I have cash, or is it non - you know, the half of your business is non-brokers, who is actually buying new now?
Andy Florance:  Well, first of all, as we've gone in this cycle, a lot of the stuff actually makes it up to my e-mail as you go into a really severe cycle like this. And you see a lot of [vignette] of what's occurring in the marketplace. So you have some people that aggressively try to negotiate amazing discounts because of the downturn. I've gotten an awful lot of e-mails from good customers who have been customers for a long time that say, [you don't pay] loves your service, I simply don't have any money to pay for it. I haven't had a commission in 18 months, so I have to appreciate everything. I have to shut it off for a while.  We're seeing a fair number of that kind of a person, who are seeing some commission checks come in, turn the service back on. So they turn it off for a year because they didn't have any money. Now that things are back, they're - and so what we're seeing again we took a -- we did analysis of all the U.S. cities and we looked at the change in rental rate in the preceding year and correlate that against the leasing volume, and there's a close correlation. So as owners basically come to grips with the fact that rents are going to be lower and they bring their rents down, tenants are taking advantage of that leasing space. We believe that's driving up these leasing commissions so people can come back on board. So there's some of that. Also why are cancellations mitigating? Because a lot of the marginal folks who just entered the business in 2007 at the crazy, cheap credit top of the market died in the first 18 months of the downturn. So, the Darwinian effect happened and extinctions occurred. And one of the reasons it's leveling out is because now we're down to looking at customers who are core customers, who are not going anywhere and they can survive in almost any market condition. And again, you go back to that. The folks who have been customers for five years or more, they're almost an 89% renewal rate and they have been throughout this entire cycle, which is really quite amazing to maintain close to 90% renewal rates in the worst commercial real estate downturn in our lives. So, now, some of the other customer segments we see coming in, we're definitely seeing a lot of banks right now. Banks are having conversations with the Fed every day about what is your loan-to-value ratio? What's your likely debt service coverage? What is the health of your commercial loan portfolio? Why should we not close your doors? So they're having those kind of conversations, and so we're seeing a pickup in interest from banks. We are -- our PPR operation has a great debt forecasting modeling service that is doing extremely well, right now. We're selling a lot of that product. Steve Miller Group up there is doing that. And then we're also seeing hedge funds emerge - the dirty word -- hedge funds emerge to take advantage of distressed sales. So, in office space, multi-family - all of the different sectors, we've seen drops in values on these properties ranging from down 20% to typically down 50% or more. So people are getting pretty excited about the ability to buy a building for $200 a square foot that was trading for $500 a square foot 18 months ago. So those kinds of customers are coming in with new capital. So this is sort of what we expected. You've got a little bit of trading in and out of our client base. We've seen a number of folks buckle in the downmarket and then new people are coming in to pick up these assets. Some of these higher-grade institutional grade investment assets don't go anywhere just because they go bankrupt, the building is still there, there is still tenants paying rents. So, that's probably more you were looking for there.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc:  No, that's really helpful. I appreciate it. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.
Andy Florance:  Okay, great.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, Brett.
Operator:  And next we'll go to the line of Ian Corydon with B. Riley & Company. Please go ahead.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company:  Thank you. Couple of quick ones. Of the 83,000 or so paying subscribers, can you say how many of those are PPR subscribers and how many are showcase also?
Andy Florance:  Two. No, Brian, what would you guess on the PPR side?
Brian Radecki:  The PPR is about 600 or so adds. So we had almost 300 adds, organically; and so that's kind of how that broke out. So we saw both organic increase and then obviously the increase we're picking up with PPR. And I don't have a number right here on what the exact number would be for the showcase side.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company:  Okay. And I'm not sure --
Andy Florance:  We'll try to address that in the next - we've got two questions on that. So we'll try to address more of that in the next earnings call.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company:  Okay. And I don't know if you gave this but do you have the number of subscribing sites at the end of the quarter?
Andy Florance:  It is 15,000 -- hold on one second. We have that number here.
Brian Radecki:  15,300.
Andy Florance:  So, 15,300. That would include PPR - it would not include PPR. It would not include PPR.
Brian Radecki:  So with PPR, it would be a couple of hundred more.
Andy Florance:  I think there's 187 with PPR.
Brian Radecki:  Yes.
Andy Florance:  So you'd add 187 onto that. And then I don't think it includes individual showcase or CLMS subscriber sites, probably does not include metropolis.
Brian Radecki:  Correct.
Andy Florance:  Right. So that's an approximate number.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company:  Okay. And it looks like that number I think is down a little bit sequentially. Are you just seeing -- are you seeing the adds come on with more sites or your existing customers adding -- existing sites adding customers. How is that working?
Andy Florance:  We're probably seeing a growth in the adds, maybe cross-selling into some institutional players or different departments, that sort of thing.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company:  Okay. And on the PPR numbers coming in ahead of expectations, was that driven by cost selling - cross-selling or is that improvement in kind of their core business?
Andy Florance:  It is. There were some good cross-sells, right of the – [right off the bat]. So like we had a deal this week, I think that came in like five days time on a cross-sell for 60,000 that was nice. Royal Bank of Scotland was a cross-sell, a big cross-sell that happened. So - and we're doing a big push on that in the fourth quarter. We're trying to get out and we've identified several hundred CoStar customers who are the right profile, revenue level, who are ideal customers for the PPR forecasting. We're trying to get out and visit every one of those folks in the fourth quarter to tell them about the PPR forecasting and analytics services. Also, we're limited to what we can talk about, but we also are providing some services to the subcontractor on the TALF program to the Fed. And you'd be shocked to know that business is growing, so the revenues from that have been climbing.
Brian Radecki:  And ahead of our expectations.
Andy Florance:  Yes. And we want to thank you as a taxpayer.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company:  My last question is on the comps and the tenant expansion. Could you just kind of give us a magnitude of how much that product has been expanded?
Andy Florance:  It's fairly dramatic and pretty important. This really represents - up until we did this, there were still 80, 90 reasonable MSAs that did not have tenant or comparable sale data from us in the United States. And these are not going to be the New Yorks and LAs. But you see - an example of a decent-sized city that would be San Antonio.
Brian Radecki:  San Antonio, Texas would be a good example.
Andy Florance:  Salt Lake City.
Brian Radecki:  Salt Lake City.
Andy Florance:  So these are pretty good-sized cities that did not have our full product suite, which would really limit your ability to do more sophisticated analytics, would probably frustrate some banks or institutional investors. And so, this means that our product offering in 70, 80 MSAs just significantly clicked up a notch here, and we've added another significant dimension to the product and it should drive strong sales in those smaller markets.  Now, you've to drive a lot of sales in those smaller markets to move the overall dial, but it's a good place to be. And we're sure trying to make sure that we're looking at every space that we're in and pursuing that objective here. The number one or number two going to number one and that does a lot of that. So if you look at some of our - if you looked at Salt Lake City and say, how we're going to be number one Salt Lake City? How we're going to be number one in San Antonio? And this does that for us.
Ian Corydon - B. Riley & Company:  Great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  And next we'll go to the line in Jim Wilson with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities:  Thanks. Morning, guys.
Andy Florance:  Morning, Jim. Thanks getting up early for us.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities:  I'm always up. So with the 600 new PPR clients, I guess, either way of looking at it or both, what kind of number or percentage were already existing CoStar customers? And I guess maybe more importantly, the bigger PPR customers or the bigger CoStar customers, which are already customers of both services? Or how many are customer of both services?
Andy Florance:  Actually, it's pretty interesting. The - of this, the site level is a little easier for me. It's about roughly 180 sites on PPR, and we're dealing with several different product areas. So, you could be a debt customer, you could be a consulting customer, you could be a baseline information customer. I believe it was - what do you say, Brian, about 70%?
Brian Radecki:  Yeah.
Andy Florance:  About 70% of those PPR customers are also CoStar customers. But you had examples where someone might be a significant national customer for PPR but only a landlord representation customer for CoStar in one Texas City. So you can have someone with a small CoStar footprint and a large PPR footprint. So you still have, even though you've got - 70% are customers of both - you still have a lot of upsell opportunity within both services. The other thing is, in talking to customers, they really regard these products as completely different and they're used in different ways by different segments generally. So our products are relied on heavily by the people doing valuation, by people doing transactions, positioning properties competitively, marketing properties, and the PPR. PPR products would tend to be used more intensely by someone doing portfolio strategy work for a larger organization. So one of the things I think is sort of exciting here is we are building together a matrix here of products that are going to eventually be seamlessly integrated that are reaching many different constituencies within these bigger operations. So we might be, with PPR, reaching the folks managing portfolio and acquisition disposition strategy. With Resolve, we can be reaching the asset managers and the finance department, CFO's office and with customer property we're reaching the appraisers, the brokers, the whole valuation side of it. So it were - these are different segments within these companies. But the bigger thing is there are hundreds of the PPR profile of customer that are CoStar subscribers that are not PPR subscribers. So we should be able to - that's where you're going to see your biggest sales growth.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities:  Yeah, that makes sense. All right and just one other question, Brian, the best tax rate to assume going forward, since it was lower this quarter?
Brian Radecki:  Yeah, I think, we're at - 2009 is at about 44%, so I think that's what the annualized is if you calculate it off the P&L. We haven't come out with 2010 guidance yet, but obviously when we do we'll give a 2010 number.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities:  All right, thanks.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, Jim.
Operator:  Next we'll go to the line of Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Hi. Thanks a lot. I'm just trying to - 
Andy Florance:  How are you doing?
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Doing all right. Just trying to reconcile on the margin expansion trajectory, I think, Brian, you had mentioned that you expect to return to more normal EBITDA margin expansion in the near future, but also margins are expected to be flat for a few quarters, if I heard correctly. So, I guess, the bigger question is how should we think about the margin goals as we move into 2010? Is margin expansion is sort of an overarching company goal or is it more likely that attractive acquisitions could weigh on that margin expansion in the near-term? And how do you balance those goals?
Brian Radecki:  Well, I think, we've long had a 30% target EBITDA margin out there for years and we've shown that the business can do that. So, I think, that's obviously the longer-term. Again, we're not giving out 2010 guidance. But I think that 30% EBITDA target margin has been posted around CoStar for the 12 years that I've been here. We've achieved that and I think that that's where we will be long-term.  In the shorter term, you are right. You have to kind of balance the potential acquisitions that could be somewhat dilutive in the short-term, that will be very accretive in the long-term. So, if I was only to look at the fourth quarter and the impact on Resolve or only look at the third quarter, the impact of PPR, I would have done the same thing, we did the comps acquisition where we now have 40, 50, 60% margins returning from it. We acquired them, they are losing about $8 million a quarter. So, I think, that you do have to balance the short-term impact with what we believe the long-term goal is. 30% has been the goal but we clearly see 50, 60% fully loaded EBITDA margins in places that we've been for over a decade. So people have seen us present. There is no reason why this business can't be doing over a billion in sales in the next 10 to 15 years and doing a 40, 50% plus fully loaded EBITDA margin. So that's where the company is focused. A lot of these acquisitions opening up these huge market opportunities is going to be what helps drive us to get there.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, another balancing act in the near-term is - you continue to see is advantageous to grow the ranks of the salespeople even though that might add some margin pressure. Where do you think the sales head count is ultimately headed? A lot of folks were added during the quarter. Does it look like that's going to go well above 200 in the coming quarters?
Andy Florance:  Well, the good news there is we have actually - Jim Black has taken over responsibility for our sales recruiting and our training of salespeople. Jim actually - for those of you who are commercial real estate nerds, would know Jim from - he basically was the predecessor to CoStar Group. He invented - he did the Black's Guide office directories, which were the Bible of commercial real estate through the '70s and '80s. So, he is a great trainer, recruiter. And we have been experiencing a very different ROI on new salespeople recently than we’ve historically experienced. So we are in some sectors, in some sales of strategies. We’re actually getting a positive ROI from new sales hires inside of four months. And historically, that ROI was out there at a year. So while we can continue to add salespeople in a - and get an ROI almost within the quarter, we will keep reporting to you that we’re increasing the sales force.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, great. And finally, just a housekeeping item, I think we're only missing one metric at this point. The number of new paying subscriber firms which last quarter I think was 494. Is there an updated metric for the third quarter?
Andy Florance:  I think it was approximately around 400, but I'll check it out and give you a number.
Brian Radecki:  Sorry about that. We normally do that.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. No problem. Thanks a lot guys.
Andy Florance: Okay. Thank you. So, again, I want to thank you all for joining the third quarter 2009 earnings call. And we look forward to updating you on the - oh my gosh - the year-end next call. So, I hope you guys have a good rest of your week.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-23 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Timothy J. Trainor – Communications Director Andrew C. Florance – Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian J. Radecki – Chief Financial Officer
Analysts:  John Neff – William Blair Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company Brett Huff – Stephens Incorporated Jim Wilson – JMP Securities Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the CoStar Group’s First Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Today we have CoStar Group’s Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Florance; Chief Financial Officer, Brian Radecki; and Communications Director, Tim Trainor. At this time all lines have been placed in to a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Trainor. Please go ahead.
Timothy J. Trainor: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to CoStar Group’s first quarter 2009 conference call. Before I turn the call over to CoStar’s Chief Executive, Andrew Florance, let me state for the record that certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements, which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ included, but are not limited to those stated in CoStar’s first quarter 2009 press release, which we issued yesterday and in CoStar’s filings with the SEC, including CoStar’s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2008 and CoStar’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements. You can find a webcast on our website at www.costar.com/investors. Thank you for joining us. I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew C. Florance: Thank you Mr. Trainor and welcome everyone to CoStar Group’s first quarter 2009 conference call. I’m very pleased to once again report that CoStar Group completed another profitable quarter earning $6.1 million in the first three months of 2009. This represents a 21% increase from $5 million in net income in the first quarter of 2008. First quarter 2009 EBITDA also increased year-over-year to $14.4 million a 25% increase compared to EBITDA of $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Being able to report year-over-year growth in quarterly net income in the middle of a very challenging economy is a testament to the strength of our business model and certainly something that all of us here at CoStar Group are proud of. I’m pleased to report the company continues to enjoy a very strong financial position. CoStar Group completed the first quarter with no debt and very large cash reserves. Because we identified deteriorating market conditions more than two years ago, we have focused on growing earnings, expanding our EBITDA margin, and significantly strengthening our balance sheet, which remains one of the company’s greatest assets. We increased our cash balance by $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2009 for a total of 20, $233.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand. The majority of these assets are in cash or invested in U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government money market funds, putting CoStar in a very secure and strong financial position. Commercial real estate market conditions have continued to weaken in the face of unprecedented job cuts and deteriorating credit markets. As a result many of our customers have experienced severely declining revenues and slowed their purchasing activity. Many commercial real estate companies and related companies have failed. Despite the current environment renewal rates for CoStar Group’s services remain relatively high within our core cut client based. Demand for our services is strong and we believe not nearly a cyclical or volatile as real estate markets are overall. In fact search activity in both our subscription based information products and in our lead generation marketing products has been climbing steadily reaching an all time high of activity in March. We believe CoStar is still an essential part of the commercial real estate business providing indispensable research verified information that is integral to our customers’ leasing asset valuation, marketing and sales processes. Furthermore, we believe we are still in the early phases of penetrating the full potential for commercial real estate information and marketing services in the United States, United Kingdom. Last year for example approximately 56% of our gross sales were derived from new customers. As economic conditions improve we believe we will see a return to higher sequential quarterly revenue growth, given our leading market position, the highly advantaged infrastructure we have in place, and the vast potential market we see for our services we believe we can continue to achieve significant earning goals we have set for the company as we have consistently done over the years. While this past quarter has been slow for the industry it’s been busy and productive for CoStar’s research operations. In that prior 12-month period CoStar research interviewed 275,000 different industry players. In doing so we conducted more than 2 million telephone interviews in order to verify and collect information. We processed more than 3 million incoming electronic submissions with information coming from brokers, owners and the like, we reviewed nearly a 100,000 SEC filings, CMBS filings, generally over the course of 24 hours after they’re filed. Our Research Analysts added more than 425 million square feet of new space availability during the first quarter of this year. Together with the more than 500 billion in for sale inventory that was listed in our database this comprehensive aggregation is available for-lease and for-sale listings, represents a unique competitive advantage for our subscribers. As I stated last call, the last thing I believe we should do in this current situation is to potentially harm our business by reducing the quality or scope of our research. Certainly keeping an eye on cost and minimizing spending are the watchwords of any recession. But even more important I believe is keeping the focus on our customers and ensuring that CoStar continues to provide the quality of information they expect and require in their line of work. We’ve begun the process announced last call to grow our research operations slightly this year in order to continue to meet customer expectations. We are committed to protecting what we view as our unique competitive advantage by ensuring that our information and marketing services remain an indispensable solution for our customers. It appears that commercial real estate asset market has followed the residential real estate into an asset bubble condition and the bubble is well into the process of bursting. The CMBS and debt markets remain frozen creating something of a liquidity nightmare, spreads on existing CMBS debts have skyrocketed. The commercial real estates are in disarray and in fact Dr. Larry Summers one of President Obama’s top economic advisers said on ‘meet the press’ this weekend that commercial real estate markets are falling apart. Outside of the credit problem the most serious issue is soaring job losses. We have lost 5.2 million U.S. jobs in the past 18 months and it’s quite possible that we’ll lose a total of 8.6 million before the economy recovers. Office sector job losses alone could claim as high as 2.8 million, assuming the average office worker consumes 250 square feet of space this number of job loses implies a potential for 700 million square feet of negative absorption. While there has been increase of hundreds of millions of square feet of available space being marketed for future availability we have actually seen just 20 million square feet of negative absorption in the office sector as of the end of the first quarter of 2009. The vacancy rates, the negative absorption, that’s the sort of stuff that a REIT or a CMBS would report in their public filings. What’s not being reported is that 680 million square feet of negative absorption lies ahead potentially. Leasing activity is down by approximately 30% and office vacancy has claimed from the recent low of 11% to a current rate of 12.4% which is really not that bad a vacancy rate, it is pretty, it’s decent. The space availability rate however, which is the leading indicator for future vacancy has climbed from 14% in the first quarter of 2006 to 24% today. This is a level we have not seen since the late 1980s and is an extremely high level. The spread between vacancy and availability rates historically is approximately 200 basis points and it’s now around 1100 basis points. Also the average number of days that a block of space remains on the market before being leased has climbed from 166 days, the strongest point in this market, to over 474 days today. The U.S. office vacancy rates could climb to over 18% before it peaks which is expected to occur in early 2010 and that would be ranging from 14% Los Angeles to more than 27% in Detroit. Inflation adjusted rents have fallen from an average of $29.88 per square foot in 2001 to $24.69 per square foot today. With climbing vacancy rates rents will likely continue to fall and income per square foot will also decline. Cap rates in the office sector have increased from 5% in the second quarter of 2008 to 7.6% currently, a 268 basis point increase in unprecedented rate and speed of deterioration. However, Cap rates have historically averaged 8.5% in the office sector so they could erode further to revert to the mean. All this is cumulative and unprecedented drop in prices per square foot for Class A office space. Inflation adjusted prices for Class A office peaked at $400 per square foot in the second quarter of 2008 and has fallen more than 50% to $185 per square foot currently. Inflation adjusted prices for Class A office space have reverted to their 20-year mean within two quick quarters. At the same time sales volumes have fallen off the cliff to as low as $1 billion per quarter. While many feel that because this drop in average sales prices is associated with small volume of building sales, is not really reflective of true asset values. Others believe that the low volumes reflect the slow acceptance among sellers for either structural or psychological reasons the new reality of lower price levels. Nonetheless, the change in volumes, liquidity and sales prices create the risk for significant debt defaults ahead. So, in point of fact we feel that the company’s 2.8 sequential decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter given the extremely negative market conditions demonstrate the strength of our business model rather than any weakness. In addition, CoStar historically begins to see improvements in market performance a quarter or so before vacancy levels peak, which we believe should occur within 3 to 4 quarters from now. On more positive news, CoStar won two prestigious awards during the first quarter of 2009, we became the first commercial real estate related company to win Energy Star Award of excellence for promotion from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA selected CoStar for this award in recognition of our role in databasing green buildings and the information available to the commercial real estate industry. In addition we are recognized for producing the groundbreaking study we published on the income premium associated with green buildings specifically those that have earned the EPA’s Energy Star Label. The American real estate society awarded CoStar’s study a prestigious academic real estate award. We did co-author that study with Dr. Norm Miller from the University of San Diego. ARES whose members include leading global academic and professional researchers annually recognizes papers that explore the critical issues of applied real estate decision-making. CoStar has been and continues to be an active supporter of academic research involving energy efficiency issues in the built environment. We’ve partnered with ARES to sponsor the journal of sustainable real estate a new real estate academic series with the goal of publishing a collection of research papers addressing sustainable real estate issues. In addition to actively sponsoring academic research CoStar has a long-standing program that provides qualified university professors and their students with full access to our comprehensive online information services for use in their research and in the classroom. More than 1100 professors and graduate students in more than 100 universities are currently enrolled in the CoStar University Program. These institutions include Harvard University, MIT and the Wharton School of Business. We are very happy to be playing an active role in providing market data and research tools for these future industry leaders. By introducing our services to new entrants in the industry as they first start their careers we believe we could gain life long customers. I think you would agree that calling the current commercial real estate conditions challenging is certainly an understatement. The widely publicized problems in the economy and particularly their impact on the commercial real estate industry continue to have an adverse effect on sales and revenue as has the devaluation of the relative value of the pound to the dollar. Our revenues declined 2.8 sequentially quarter-over-quarter from $52.9 million to $51.4 million. At the end of the first quarter 2009 the company had 154 sales representatives on staff consisting of 114 U.S. subscription sales reps, eight U.S. advertising sales reps, 11 in-house sales reps, and 21 very good UK skilled sales reps, they had a great month last month. This is a slight increase over the prior quarter, we currently have a strong class of sales reps in training and we’ve been fortunate to attract several top candidates for the exceptional sales in commercial real estate experienced. With a weaker market we are now focusing on hiring only experienced sales reps with commercial real estate experience. I expect our overall sales force to grow moderately in the second and third quarters. The average new contract value for the first quarter was down at $4,964. We signed a total of 613 new subscribing firms during the first quarter of 2009, a 19% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008. And although these new firms tend initially to buy at a lower price point, once they become clients and learn more about our product offerings they tend to buy additional information and marketing services from us. Last year just under half of our gross sales were from existing clients. So, we are very happy to see this continued success in attracting new subscribers. The impact from adverse market conditions was also apparent in our net subscriber account, which dropped during the quarter to approximately 84,000 subscribers. The UK saw a disproportionate share of this decline in subscriber account due to product consolidation, weak market conditions and customer list scrubbing. The overall number of subscriber sites dropped only slightly during the quarter from 15,920 at year-end to 2008 to, I am sorry from 15,920 at year-end 2008 to 15,500 subscriber sites at the end of quarter for 2009. So you have about 420-subscriber site drop q-over-q. Discrepancy between the very small drop in subscriber sites and a larger drop in individual subscribers is predominately attributable to pervasive head count reductions among our clients. Our 12 months trailing customer renewal rate for CoStar’s subscription based services dropped slightly to 87%. And renewal rates with customers who have subscribed to CoStar for more than five years remained over 90% which we believe is very encouraging given that many of these firms are seeing significant declines in their revenue. In order to maximize our renewal rate we actively track all of our cancellations and attempt to accurately determine their root cause. Our sales quality assurance team makes every attempt to debrief any lost customer, review the customer history, speak with the CoStar account rep that was on the account and ultimately determine the true cause of the cancellation, by doing this and making this invest, we hope to learn what actions we can take to reduce any cancellations. For the first three months of 2009 we can tell you that 56% of the cancellations are attributable to economic conditions, 7% are due to a customer leaving commercial real estate. 13% are due to bankruptcy, 1% we shutoff because they were sharing passwords or stealing services, 3% canceled because of concerns about our data quality, 1% canceled to use a competing service, 5% canceled because they just didn’t find enough use for our service, 3% cited their inability to afford or justify the price. And 10% we attribute to our poor customer service or account executive performance. We can further concentrate the cancelation’s causes to 76% due to economic conditions, 13% are CoStar’s fault, 9% because the product is not the right fit, 1% is due to theft and 1% is due to competitive loss. If you factor in those cases where customers reduced the number of seats of service to reduce their contract spend well more than 80% of our current cancellations are possibly attributable to economic conditions. As I previously indicated we have put into effect several policies to address this issue of higher cancellation rates especially among our newest clients who traditionally take up several years to fully integrate our products into their business operation. Under our current 2009 commission plan CoStar sales executives are paid only for new subscribers who actively use our services in any given month during their first year of service. As a result the usage rate among new customers has soared to 70%, at this point the usage associated with our newest customers is on par with that of our established customers. With the 2009 sales incentive plan there is much greater focus in making sure that all of our subscribing potential users are in fact using and gaining value from our products. During the course of the first quarter 2009 nearly 5000 individual subscribers who are not recently or had never used our products began using them. CoStar signed a number of major clients to renewal agreements during the quarter. In addition to the multi-million dollar enterprise wide agreement with Cushman & Wakefield we announced this February we’ve renewed agreements with Wells Fargo the financial services giant that recently acquired Wachovia and that has Eastdil Secured a large a leading investment sales broker as a subsidiary. We’ve renewed Simon Property Group the largest U.S. shopping-mall owner and UGL Equis’ a leading tenant rep firm with 27 offices throughout the United States. In addition we renewed Deloitte the auditing, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services firms. CoStar Group welcomes the opportunity to continue serving these clients for years to come. Since launching last May CoStar Showcase has proven to be an extremely viable tool for helping commercial real estate brokers maintain or expand their floor leads from prospective tenants and buyers at a time when traditional lead channels are drying up. Total search volume on Showcase again increased during the quarter from $2.9 million searches on Showcase in the fourth quarter 2008, to $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 and property views increased as well during the same period to more than $96 million. We now have more than 1,500 subscribing entities representing approximately 4,000 brokers with listings. As a result we’re now generating more than $3.3 million annualized revenue from Showcase. We believe we can show strong growth in the product throughout the year, we also believe that the product is now probable and that incremental sales are at an extremely high margin. As a standard practice CoStar offers our information services under company wide subscriptions and that is how we initially marketed Showcase. However we believe Showcase holds wide appeal for individual brokers who may want to take advantage of the service, but whose company is not prepared to subscribe. For this reason we’ve recently made the decision to begin offering individual Showcase subscriptions, in addition to the company wide subscription option we have offered since launch. Primarily competitors to Showcase offer individual subscriptions so we believe this move now puts Showcase on an equal footing with those services in terms of contract structure. To further enhance the appeal of Showcase we are making the these individual subscriptions available at a low flat monthly rate of 4,995 no matter how many listing the client listings, the client chooses to advertise. That’s basically an ‘all you can eat’ buffet; the service can be ordered directly from our website using a credit card and is available on a month-to-month basis with no long-term agreement required. We believe this pricing model of one low price and unlimited listings will compete very favorably with the primarily competitor in this space, which bases its fees on the number of listings advertised and has aggressively raised its prices off late particularly of those people who have a large number of listings. We believe an individual with one to three listings will save $240 a year if they use Showcase rather than the primary competitor in this space. Individual or a broker with four listings will save $720 a year using our service rather than the competitor service and a broker with 15 listings will save $2,340 a year or 79% by using Showcase rather than the competing service. One low very simple price no matter how many listings the broker has. We also are convinced that Showcase is a superior service that the value proportion is even more compelling spending dramatically less and get a much better service, it’s like asking would you rather spend $4 a gallon for regular unleaded or save 79% and pay $0.84 per gallon per premium unleaded. All Showcase subscribers will continue to benefit from the features that we believe have really helped distinguish Showcase from competitors in this space including CoStar’s ongoing significant investment in paid search marketing efforts on behalf of our clients to capture more traffic from major search engines such as Google and Yahoo and MSN. The strong appeal for searches to take advantage of the continuously updated listing information available on Showcase through CoStar’s extensive research operations, and the fact that Showcase does not require searchers to register before they can see all details on a Showcase listing. Before turning the call over to Mr. Radecki for more in depth discussion of our quarterly financial performance and outlook let me reiterate that we remain very focused on managing our business efficiently, minimizing spending and preserving value to continue operating profitably in this difficult economic environment. There is no question that the rest of 2009 will be challenging and of course we will continue to monitor our position very carefully and respond accordingly. We believe that the fact that we continue to generate strong earnings during what certainly appears to be the worst recession in two generations reflects the strong fundamentals of our business. I’m confident that we will continue delivering long-term value to our customers and shareholders as well as opportunity to our employees and additional growth opportunities for CoStar Group. Brian?
Brian J. Radecki: Thank you, Andy. I think we just set a record, we did. It was 35 minutes. So, I think in ten years of doing earnings call that was 31 since 31 minutes and Andy’s shortest script, he cut it back from a 100 pages down to 50. It’s good, thanks Andy.
Andrew C. Florance: You’re welcome Brian.
Brian J. Radecki: As mentioned, as Andy mentioned we are continuing to manage the business well in this very difficult economic environment. Despite U.S. GDP falling over 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the national unemployment rate raising 8.5% in March, CoStar achieved another strong quarter of earnings and cash generation in the first quarter of 2009. Our net income for the first quarter of 2009 increased 21.1% a $6.1 million or $0.31 per diluted share from five million or $0.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. EBITDA which is our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the first quarter of 2009 was $14.4 million an increase of 25.2% compared to EBITDA of $11.5 million for the first quarter of 2008. Reconciliation of EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to GAAP basis results shown in detail on our press release issued yesterday is available on our website at www.costar.com. Revenues in the first quarter of 2009 decreased approximately 900,000 compared to the first quarter of 2008. These revenues included unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $1.6 million on our international revenue. On a functional currency basis U.S. revenue in the first quarter of 2009 totaled $47.1 million, which is a 1.6% increase compared to $46.4 million in the first quarter of 2008. International revenue totaled £2.9 million in the first quarter of 2009 compared to £3 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2008. International operations contributed approximately 8.2% of total revenues in the first quarter and international subscription revenues account for approximately 88.8% of the international revenues in the first quarter of 2009. In Q1 of 2009 non-subscription based revenues, which is ad hoc revenue that is mostly related to services to facilitate the buying and selling of commercial buildings continued to be extremely weak. We do not expect that type of non-subscription based revenue to improve for several quarters given the current market condition. But as most of you probably know this type of non-subscription based revenue accounts for less than 5% of CoStar’s total revenues. CoStar’s subscription revenues actually accounted for 95.9% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2009. Turning to our renewal rate, which is a measure of renewing subscribing revenue, our 12-month trailing renewal rate remained strong at 87.3%. We consider the 12-month trailing renewal rate to be a good indicator of the strength of our business model as subscription revenues account for most of our total revenue and the majority of our subscribers are on annual or longer-term agreements. As we have publicly stated for more than a year now we do expect our 12-months trailing renewal rate to continue to decline at low to mid 80s for the calendar year in this current economic cycle. Our EBITDA margin for our U.S. operations was $30.9 million in the first quarter 2009, which is a testament to the earnings power of our business model in even the most challenging environments. Our overall consolidated EBITDA margin for Q1 of 2009 was 28.1 compared to 22% in Q1 of 2008. We remained focused on our 2009 plan and outlook and working towards our goal that we set out in Q2 of 2008 of $100 million in annualized EBITDA run rate. We fully expect to return to more normalized revenue growth rates we have enjoyed in the past decade and expanding margins once we see positive GDP growth and encouraging employment figures. For now we continue to expect to add new subscribers, renew current subscribers and to generate strong earnings and cash flow through the challenging environment. I would like to remind everybody that when we return to revenue growth the majority of our incremental revenue drops from the top line to the bottom line, which provide us the strong earnings and cash flow generation. Moving to gross margin on a quarter-over-quarter basis, gross margin decreased by approximately 700,000 from $35.2 million in Q4 of 2008 to $34.5 million in Q1 of 2009. Gross margin percentage improved to 67.1% in Q1 of 2009 from 66.5% in Q4 of 2008. Turning to expenses for the quarter, overall expenses were at $23.7 million in Q1 an increase of $1.3 million from $22.4 million in Q4 of 2008. This increase resulted principally from increased sales and marketing expenses, as well as a slight increase in bad debt as expected. Legal expenses for the first quarter was approximately $1.1 million, an increase 300,000 from Q4 2008. We consider these legal costs like most other public companies, to be normal reoccurring costs and we anticipate these will continue for the foreseeable future. As you are aware we are currently involved in several lawsuits, and could be involved in others aimed at protecting our intellectual property rights. As always we follow U.S. GAAP based accounting to report all our legal expenses, in our income statement, EBITDA and in our earnings outlook for the year. With respect to the balance sheet we ended the first quarter 2009 with approximately $233.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments an increase of $8.9 million since December 2008 and we have no long-term debt. Now I will conclude my remarks with our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2009 in detail. As is typical our guidance takes into account recent growth rate in our results, which maybe impacted by uncertainties surrounding foreign exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in the global economy. We have attempted to reflect global weakness in the economy in our guidance to recognize we had a period of significant flux and the economic environment is still an uncharted territory. However, we remain confident in our earnings guidance, as we believe one of the key strengths of our subscription based business model with a relatively fixed cost structure is it provides good earnings visibility even in a difficult environment. Unlike many other public companies out there, who have decided not to give annual guidance, we continue to provide this visibility and we include our legal expenses. As stated in our press release, we expect for the second quarter of 2009 revenue in the range of $49.5 million to $51 million and for the full year we continue to expect approximately a $198 million to $203 million in revenues. Given the unprecedented current economic conditions our actual second quarter results and full year 2009 results could differ slightly from our guidance. In more detail, let me talk about the rest of the P&L. We expect cost of revenues, which is approximately $16.9 million in Q1 to rise slightly throughout the year due to the variable timing differences of new hires and research and other research related costs. As we explained last quarter we expect to continue to hire and staff our research group to provide the highest quality information to meet the needs of our clients in this difficult environment. Moving down to P&L we expect seasonally higher, selling and marketing expenses of approximately $1 million primarily associated with the ICSC Trade Show and the marketing of Showcase. Software development should remain fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter and flat for 2009. G&A is expected to increase by approximately $1 million in the second quarter due to the increased legal cost. And we expect approximately 700,000 in purchase amortization in Q2 of 2009 and approximately $3.5 million for the full year 2009. We continue to expect the interest rate or interest income to be approximately 0.5% in 2009. The majority of our approximately $233 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments currently in cash and assets in U.S. treasuries or other Government money market funds. Overall our effective tax rate we expect to be approximately 45% for 2009. In terms of earnings, we expect second quarter 2009 fully diluted net income per share of approximately $0.22 to $0.25. We continue to expect fully diluted net income of approximately 1 to $1.05 per share for the full year 2009, which includes approximately $6 million in pre-tax, non-cash equity compensation charges related to restricted stock and options. Capital expenditures for the first quarter 2009 was approximately $1 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately $4 million to $7 million, which include investments in the facilities to upgrade several field sales office hubs, network equipment and workstations to upgrade and support the ongoing operations. We continue to look for areas of cost savings and may consolidate or move office space in 2009 to save money and/or upgrade the space which should create lease operating gains or losses for the company which is similar to what we did in Q4, 2007 and Q2 of 2008. Just like in prior years we would expect this will create substantial long-term savings for the company. In conclusion, the entire CoStar management team remains focused and fully committed to achieving our outlook for 2009. We expect to manage the business through this current environment and capitalize on our stable subscription based business model to position us for long-term growth opportunities and working towards our long-term goal of $100 million in annualized EBITDA run rate. Economic conditions could worsen, but we believe we are prepared to weather this economic cycle. We believe our services our core to our clients’ ability to deliver on their business and that the market need for our service remains resilient. Our business model remains strong and the fact that we have a 95% subscription based business with high renewal rates, a unique proprietary database with a market-leading position, strong balance sheet, no debt and high cash flow. We believe these challenging times will continue to create opportunities for us as a market leader. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for high margin revenue growth following the investments we have made, in the addition of new services like CoStar Showcase. No company is recession proof, but as I said many times CoStar is not immune to the challenges in these economies, but without a doubt we are clear about our priorities and confident in our plans. We continue to look forward to reporting that progress to you and with that I open up the call for any questions
Operator: All right thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from John Neff from William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Hi guys.
Andrew C. Florance: Good morning Mr. Neff.
Brian J. Radecki: Hi John.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: A few questions for you and then I can get back in queue for some others. But the, last quarter the guidance range was $201 million to $207 million now 198 to 203, is that all due to foreign exchange and what does it assume exchange rates continue as of when, the end of the quarter or where they stand today?
Brian J. Radecki: John, I didn’t change those. As I reiterated it and what I did was consolidated it. When we came up with and provided our initial calendar year 2009 revenue guidance in February, we assumed that the U.S. dollar would strengthen versus the pound over the course of 2009 because that was the trend for the prior six months and there was no sign of it stopping. We’re really not trying to forecast exchange rates, really just kind of reiterating the same thing and I consolidated them to make it simpler for people because I think there is some confusion around that.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Okay. So, it’s purely a reflection of the UK correction of the business.
Brian J. Radecki: Correct.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Okay. So, it’s really just due to FX?
Andrew C. Florance: Correct and we confused you in order to avoid confusion.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: What were the net annualized subscription bookings in the quarter?
Andrew C. Florance: Do you have the number?
Brian J. Radecki: John, I mean they are obviously negative because revenue growth is negative. So, we haven’t really talked about that, the last few quarters we’ve been focusing on more some of the operating metrics.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Okay. And then you mentioned bad debt expense, DSO’s are creeping up a little bit, but what’s going on with bad debt expenses, has that been keeping pace and where does that stand at the end of the quarter?
Brian J. Radecki: Yeah it’s up slightly over the fourth quarter, it’s right about where we thought it would be, we kind of assumed we’d have $0.5 million or a million more in bad debt this year and right now it’s right around where we thought it would be so. Hasn’t really gotten significantly worse but obviously in this environment you’ve got companies that are struggling and some of them that are just going out of business.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Okay, and then the quick question on the Showcase then I can get back in queue? The new individualized contract pricing, 49.95 a month, roughly 600 a year. How does that compare to the average enterprise annual subscription price?
Brian J. Radecki: If you take the average enterprise agreement it would be, it would be just slightly less than that, so you’d have some enterprise agreements that would be slightly more and some will be slightly less. But on average the new individuals slightly below that enterprise agreement level. You get more benefits if you are in enterprise, so for instance you get the company website and you don’t get that if you are an individual subscriber, you get, your listings on Showcase and you get a broker page, but if you are a firm subscribing, you get a firm website, broker pages for all your brokers plus all your firm listings on the site. So, they’re not entirely similar, there’s slightly, there is little more benefit especially associated with the enterprise agreement.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: These enterprise agreement, is it $900 on average or is it.
Brian J. Radecki: I only have the numbers for it, what above stand to on a per person basis and it’s just slightly more than the individual cost and that reflects the benefit of the firm website and the fact that firm has a tougher time, managing, collecting, and posting all their listings up, then does a individual broker. So, I think there’s not a lot of competition between the two.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Okay.
Brian J. Radecki: There’s some but not a lot.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Great, thank you.
Brian J. Radecki: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Maietta from Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company: Thanks very much.
Brian J. Radecki: Hi Jon.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Hi Andy, hi Brian.
Andrew C. Florance: Hi Jon.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Andy the first question I had was it, I don’t think you talked about the analytics offering at all this quarter, could you just maybe talk about those processes of refreshing that offering?
Andrew C. Florance: Sure. That remains a significant focus for us and we are toning down our discussion of it so that when we release those products there will be something of a surprise in nature and depth and scope to our competitors. So, we are, our development teams are working on that and we’re continuing to grow our capabilities there. We think it’s a $50 million to $100 million potential revenue add over 5 years plus but we are discussing, we are not discussing the details about it as much now.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Got it fair enough, okay. And Andy just a point of clarification, you had mentioned I think that you would either you, CoStar or the markets will typically see a rebound couple of quarters ahead of the vacancy rates peaking, was that correct or?
Andrew C. Florance: Yes we, I mean really have a sample set of two cycles, but there appears to be a pretty strong correlation where our market performance tends to pickup about a quarter or so before vacancy rates shift directions or hit their peak. So, I mean that’s generally because people can sort of tell right before the vacancy rates hit the peak that the markets are turning and vacancy rates are pretty much the driver of the income and the rental rates and the values outside of capital market costs.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Got it okay. And then Brian as you think about kind of revenue linearity over the course of this year just given the nature of the subscription model does it become tough to go sequentially negative three quarters in a row, four quarter in a row, barring, you know, a dozen larger customers falling out in one quarter.
Brian J. Radecki: Yeah I mean barring anything major, which still happens at some of the large financial service firms I mean, I think we, we are anticipating the renewal rate to decline a little bit, I think you are going to see the second quarter is going look a lot like the first quarter. And I do think as you get into the third and fourth quarter because of the subscription based model, I do think it is get harder, but I definitely think that the second quarter is going to look a lot like which is what we have expected for a long time now the first quarter.
Andrew C. Florance: And you have sort of hit a plateauing here so you know sort of a decline in the rate of decline.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Yeah, and then just a couple more quick ones. The million dollars in incremental legal expense that was probably on the press release was that is that incremental to the guidance that was provided on the last quarterly call or was that already taken through the earnings guidance?
Andrew C. Florance: I’m going to read my prepared statement from my legal council here and I anticipated this question so I had him giving it to me right before the call started. During Q2 we have increased discovery related legal cost depositions, document productions et cetera connected with our lawsuits against LoopNet in the Europe and California. We also have a trial scheduled in June on one of our anti-piracy cases. For Q3 we anticipate while our preliminary injunction hearings in July on our California case against LoopNet and continuing discovery costs on our New York litigation against LoopNet. But I think this is, and again we have to see how these things pan out so that was my prepared statement. I think that it remains to be seen. I think what’s happen is some of the costs maybe accelerated, they’re coming sooner so of course you have to wait and kind of see how those things pan out. So, it’s definitely it’s an increase in Q2 which is, which is I didn’t originally anticipate, but I think it’s baked into the kind of that dollar to dollar five range that I had already given for the year, so I’m not really coming off of that.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Got it, okay. And then just the last one from me. I was wondering if in addition to the renewal rate that you guys published do you also track kind of dollar renewal rates. So, if you had X amount of dollars coming up for renewal this quarter what percentage of those actually renewed?
Brian J. Radecki: Well the renewal rate is based on dollars not, you know, sites or paying subscribers. It’s based on the dollars renewing that’s essentially what it is, obviously if you actually looked at, if you look at those three metrics the sites only decreased slightly the revenue decreased slightly 2.8% but the paying subscribers dropped a lot more. So, it’s only dollars renewing it, it wouldn’t be fair to say if we lost a client that was paying us $10 million a year that, we only lost one client, a small percentage of our clients. So and then, but the two by chance tend to be fairly similar.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Correct
Brian J. Radecki: The sites and dollars, the sites and dollars will track much closer than the paying subscriber number.
Jonathan Maietta – Needham & Company : Okay got it. Okay thanks very much.
Andrew C. Florance: Yeah, you are welcome.
Brian J. Radecki: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Huff, Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc. : Good morning Brian, and good morning Andy.
Andrew C. Florance: Good morning Brett.
Brian J. Radecki: Hi Brett.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc. : Question on just Andy may be you could give us some color on how the conversations are going just from a value proposition point of view both when you all are pitching new business, and or when you are pitching cross sales just so that I get a better sense of what are the things people are focused on and what seems to be working?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, it’s, a lot of the same value proposition is that it has always been, it is cost reduction. So I think the bigger firms are more focused on the fact that our products cut their costs in total and provide a high quality service for their folks at the mid size and smaller firms it’s revenue generation that they are focused on as much as anything. So being able to produce a more powerful, more professional presentation and generate leads off the Internet is working and the appraisal side of the world, they’re actually likely to see a little bit of an up tick in appraisal volume and in fact the cancellation rates there are haven’t even come off of historical highs, their cancellation rates are very, very low right now. And those folks it’s just critical them in terms of productivity. It allows them to do appraisals much more cost effectively so they really need it to make their margin goals. And a big overriding challenge is the fact that some of these firms it’s not unusual that these firms are seeing their revenues down in excess of 40% right now. So that’s the challenge we’re getting through.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc. : Okay. And when you, can you give us more of a sense of cross sale, you’ve never given us really data on sort of what the cross sale numbers where in terms of numbers of firms that you’ve cross sold additional products into and/or sort of the average dollar amount? Could you give us any even qualitative sense of that, is it more or less or steady versus couple quarters ago or can you give us any color on that?
Andrew C. Florance: I could say that because our Showcase and a larger volume of smaller sort of smaller contracts, the cross selling activity is slightly lower because the other side picked up. So we’re at probably 45% of the sales of each month, little more than 45% of sales each month is cross selling products. I don’t have hard data on the number of firms or any given time period. I think it’s remained fairly constant. It’s basically half of what the new sales activity is and I would imagine that it is probably similar in terms of number of contracts. There’s a lot of new markets to add on, they add on additional services, be it Showcase, be it COMPS or Tenant, and then there is a lot of new user growth. So right now there is a lot of musical chairs going on in the industry and you might have a firm failing and then other small firms in the market picking up. The brokers who are at that firm and they will add a license here or there and we couldn’t consider that cross selling. So there are already clients, they pickup a broker here from sales firm and they add two seats and begin paying us incrementally more for those additional seats.  
Brian J . Radecki: And Bred I think, when I look back at that I would say historically over the past decade it’s always been around 50%. So as Andy said I think it may be it’s down to 45%. I think that’s because we’re getting a lot of these newer Showcase type people and which I think we talked about a couple of quarters ago that was what we anticipated to happen. But it’s typically around that that 50% plus or minus 5% and it is exactly what Andy said it’s people adding new geography, either new products and services, upgrading the suite. I think we have a very successful track record for decade and a half, two decades of getting people in kind of on a basic service and after they see the value on that, up selling them and it’s something we’ve done for decades and I would anticipate a lot of these sales that we have today will do the same thing over the next decade.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc. : Okay, and then one last question again sort of bigger picture, in the, I don’t know how you want to talk about them, but in the secondary and tertiary markets that are relatively newer to your geography spread. I remember looking at your slide there is that pyramid of early adopters, middle and then late. Can you give us color on how that’s going has the economy made that harder? Have you found that the characteristic of those markets are making it easier or harder to penetrate right now and/or how many markets you feel like you are being very successful in or you can give us a sense of that?
Andrew C. Florance:  I think it’s safe to say and I think different markets during different phases and cycles and it’s no different than the larger market. So, you know like a Boston would have been extremely successful for us right off of the bat, whereas Philadelphia was a slow bloomer, but is a now extremely successful market. So it may have Philadelphia probably took us couple extra years to get going but is now extremely successful. The same thing is true with these 200 new markets. Some have come on really quickly like Richmond, Virginia and then others are much slower and it could be something like Grand Rapids where the economy there is just not very robust and there is not lot of demand for anything there. So, I would say that the majority of the markets are current, of the small tertiary markets are in the top of the pyramid still, they are in the early stages. And a smaller percentage, maybe 20% are moving into the mid part of the pyramid. We know that traditional moving into owners and smaller brokerage firm space. But we have a strategy that we hope to deploy within the next quarter or so for these smaller markets that we think will accelerate the growth in the smaller markets that we’re really quite excited about and think it will be, I think it’s a very strong strategy that we’re not going to talk about.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc. : Okay, and I do have one last question. I guess do you have any color on specifically that, I think it’s round numbers 20% that are of customers that are owners, bank lenders, banks, REITs, stuff like that any change in how that’s looking I assume it’s not getting better, I know it’s getting worse but...
Andrew C. Florance: Yeah, when you go through a list of who some of your bigger cancellations are they, they are the names, there is some bigger owners or banks or lenders or commercial real estate investment banks. So, but big picture that looking at where the reversals come from the brokerage reversals are slightly less than they, than they are as a percentage of our revenue and the owners and mortgage folks and institutional investors are slightly higher than they represent as a percentage of our customer base. And then I think retailers are slightly higher than they represent part of our customer base. And then appraisers and governments remain very low at the cancellation level.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc. : Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wilson of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
James Wilson – JMP Securities: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Andrew C. Florance: Hey Jim.
Brian J. Radecki: Hi Jim.
James Wilson – JMP Securities: Let’s see, I wonder I guess just to continue one little further part of the new customer question. I’m guessing it’s too early but are you seeing any interest or sales to real estate private equity opportunity funds or anything starting to crop up that you might see as the vulture share eventually attack in the commercial real estate shift of assets?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, I mean, you’re right to pick up on the fact that some people are who are fresh capital are going to begin acquire assets now moving forward are probably going to end up making a real killing over the next decade a la Sam Zel then look at what he did in the past cycle. So, I think we are beginning to see some of that, but we’re probably, they’re forming right now. We are hearing a lot about it now and some of them are basically people who are traditional commercial side investors who are just found themselves distressed. The vulture funds to raise capital but you’re beginning to see and you saw the Vornado equity offering with a label of distressed opportunity funds kind of thing. So, it’s beginning to pickup and I think and we’ve been waiting for that and I think that’s probably something we’re going to see this quarter, next quarter. One interesting little segment we’re seeing some revenue come from is engineers, who are looking to go into buildings and certify them as energy star. We had a great sales month in London last month on the basis of these engineers looking to go in there and get ready to capture some of these conversions to more energy efficient buildings and in the U.S. I think it will even bigger market with all the stimulus dollars going into retrofitting buildings, someone’s got to do that and CoStar has the all the information as to which ones are green, which ones are not and who is who. So I think that will also drive some unusual revenue.
James Wilson – JMP Securities: Okay, and then I guess my second question, that’s great, on kind of your overview and five year outlook on the analytic side. I was wondering since as part of your guidance at the beginning of the year to be adding research staff sort of how, how that’s progressing, are you in quarters away ahead of a 12-month curve or how should we kind of think about that?
Andrew C. Florance: Yeah I think I mean we have actually just begun I mean, it seems like we had talked to you guys yesterday but that process just kind has begun at the end of the first quarter so I think we are up. I don’t have the exact numbers with me but 10 or so researchers I think we plan them being up 50 or 60 this year. So I think we’re starting that process and it will probably be fairly gradual throughout the year, so that’s just kind of beginning now.
James Wilson – JMP Securities: Okay. All right, great. Thanks.
Andrew C. Florance: Thank you Jim.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead sir.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Hi, and thanks a lot. First just following up on a recent question could you provide a little more color on the pricing environment? It sounds like at least for Showcase competitors are charging more, which is good news for you. Elsewhere what are you hearing from customers in terms of their ability and their willingness to pay given the macro environment? So in other words regardless of the value proposition to their own business, how is the pricing environment for your services?
Andrew C. Florance: I think that on the Showcase front we’re a new entrant there and we have the advantage of having a major piece of our cost base is covered through our other profitable product areas so this is sort of a product for us which has incremental margin, we think we’re cost advantaged here so we can take a significant share and generate good earnings out but with a more competitive price points. It’s more a competitive positioning issue for us. Most of the folks, can afford to pay aren’t really on lead generation in a down market they are willing to pay for it. You’ve got a clear segment of the market which is probably, 40% of the folks out there right now who are down to only essential expenses or have moved below essential expenses, and for those folks it is just tough to sell them anything or renew them on anything and then you’ve got another segment of the market, as Jim Wilson points out folks who are beginning to come in as vulture investors who have are very flush, hedge funds or very flush to come into this space. Pricing is not an issue with those folks and then another thing that when the, silver lining in a negative cycle is many, many, many of these larger firms get really serious about cleaning out overlapping expenses and they rely more and more on CoStar group in a down cycle like this and they are very, they want to get a fair price but they are looking to save five, ten times as much out of their internal operations by going to a CoStar group. So they are less price sensitive and ultimately we come out of the cycle with a stronger relationship with those bigger firms.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley : Okay.
Andrew C. Florance: Hope that helps.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley : Yes, that answers it thanks. And then I may have missed it but what are you thinking in terms of uses of cash considering the healthy cash balance? Could you just give us an update on your thinking there?
Andrew C. Florance: We are, continuing to evaluate at every Board meeting the options there for buyback, dividend and the like. Obviously in this very unusual environment we like to have a window to when the vacancy rates stabilize that’s usually our strong point, we like to be, have a clear vision of that position of strength as we make such decisions. And there is a fairly robust set of opportunities out there for acquisitions that become more reasonable as the market moves on. So we think there are some interesting things out there that could be uses of cash that would be accretive to the company and strategically valuable.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley : Okay, that’s great. Thanks a lot.
Andrew C. Florance: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question comes from John Neff, William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Hey, guys thanks for the follow-up. Brian I just want to make sure I understood the timing. You talked about the $100 million annualized EBITDA as being a long-term target. I wanted to see if that was in anyway anchored to the previous not expectation but exiting 4Q ‘10 in terms timeframe, in determining the timeframe?
Brian J. Radecki: Yeah, I think we are still focused on it. I mean that is the long-term goal and I think Andy and I stated last quarter I think as we, as things clarify at the end of this year and early next year if conditions improve, that could still be doable. So I think obviously it’s fairly long-term it’s out there, it’s a couple of years away and we’ll just see how it goes each quarter.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Okay and then you mentioned Andy good color on the sort of the reasons or rationale for cancellations. I think you said 3% of the cancels fell into sort of a data quality issue...
Andrew C. Florance: Yes.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: And I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what were the concerns that were voiced about data quality and how seriously you take those?
Andrew C. Florance: Well, obviously you’d like the number to be zero, but the, what we attempt to do as a business is obviously impossible to do perfectly in tracking the large to manageable moving marketplace in a pretty wild, wild west environment. So as things go 3% cancellation for data is very low, we are not entirely happy with it and it would be it would be something that we, we are increasing the size of the research staff to continually improve the quality of the data right now. We think that as we come through the year and get that research staff the number of people managing portfolios up by 50 plus people, we can probably pull that cancellation first from 3% per data down to 1.5% per data. You will never get it to zero because there will be somebody who has purchased the product for some sort of function that requires perfect, perfect data and maybe data we don’t collect or maybe they are trying to get, they are trying to sell elevator maintenance and they need to know precisely the number of elevators in every property and the speed or something we just don’t have that data. So it could be a market where they are, perhaps the researcher causing it or it could be something where the expectation for what we could provide was simply not realistic. But big picture it’s that, pretty good number. I’d say that in our operating history there have been probably two different periods where the number was probably dramatically higher than that and so we probably had a period or two where we were in the 10%, 12% so 3% is pretty good.
Brian J. Radecki: Hey John let me just add a few things to that, 3% is actually a very, very low in this type of environment when you track discreet data as we do that, that’s moving as fast as it is, but I would just like to make sure to reiterate we’ve got almost 900 researchers, we are looking at adding 50, 60, 70 this year to improve the data quality even more. What we add this year will be more than more researchers than anybody else out there, just what we add this year forget the 900 we already have. So I think it’s always comparable to what’s the next closest person out there, I think it’s not even close, our data quality is heads and tails so much higher than anything else out there. And that’s why you see the DB agreement, you see the Cushman & Wakefield agreement I mean it just, it speaks for itself.
John Neff – William Blair & Company: Great. Thank you very much.
Brian J. Radecki: Great thanks guys.
Andrew C. Florance: So with that we are at an hour and almost 15 minutes we are going to wind up our first quarter call. Thank you all very much for joining us, and look forward to updating you on our progress and performance at the next quarterly earnings conference call.
Operator:  Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-19 11:00:00) =====

Analysts : John Neff - William Blair Jonathan Maietta - Needham and Company James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank  Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley  
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the CoStar Group's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2008 Conference Call. Today we have CoStar Group's Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Florance; Chief Financial Officer Brian Radecki; and Communication Director, Tim Trainor. At this time all lines have been placed in to a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Trainor. Please go ahead. 
Tim Trainor: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to CoStar Group's fourth quarter and year end 2008 conference call. Before I turn the call over to CoStar's Chief Executive, Andrew Florance, let me state for the record that certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ included, but are not limited to those stated in CoStar's fourth quarter and year end 2008 press release which we issued yesterday and in CoStar's filings with the SEC, including CoStar's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007 and CoStar's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 under the heading Risk Factors. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements. You can find a webcast of this conference on our website at www.costar.com/investors. Thank you for joining us. I would turn the call over to Mr. Florance. Andy. 
Andy Florance: Thank you, Tim. Welcome everyone to CoStar Group's fourth quarter and year end 2008 conference call. I am pleased today to report our results for 2008 a year in which CoStar continued to benefit from our core three attributes as a company. The strength of our subscription-based business model, our industry-leading research and the value of our products that our products provide to our subscribers. All of which helped us to strengthen an already strong financial position and achieve the earnings goal we set out two years ago.  Net income for the year increased 145% to $24.6 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to $10.1 million or $0.52 per diluted share for 2007. And EBITDA for the full year in 2008 was $56.6 million, a 115% increase compared to EBITDA of $26.4 million in 2007. These results exclude the favorable one-time gain associated with the lease assignment on our former London office in 2007 to more clearly show the organic earnings growth we generated in our business. Being able to again report triple digit year-over-year quarterly net income growth in the middle of a very challenging economy is something all of us here at CoStar Group are very proud of. The fact that we are successful in executing the plan we laid out to investors to achieve the earnings goals we set clearly demonstrates the absolute strength and resilience of CoStar's business model. The strong profits we generated follow the substantial investments we made to significantly expand our commercial real estate coverage in the US and the UK in 2006. In 2007, we completed the work of adding hundreds of thousands of new properties to our database, and announced plans to focus on earnings leverage following those substantial investments. In 2008, we delivered on the aggressive earnings growth we promised and succeeded in raising our then company wide 9% EBITDA earnings margin to a 30% EBITDA margin in our US operations by the end of 2008. Having met and exceeded that target, an entire quarter ahead of plan, we committed last quarter to achieving a company wide EBITDA margin of 30% by the end of 2008. Once again, we achieved that very significant company wide margin by continuing to expand our margins in the US and successfully bringing our international operations into the block. Our focus on growing earnings over the past year has had the additional benefit of significantly strengthening CoStar's balance sheet, which remains one of the company's greatest assets. We increased our cash balance by more than $37 million in 2008 for a total of $225 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments on hand at the end of last year. The majority of these assets are invested in cash, as well as in US Treasury and other US Government money market funds. As a result of our success in growing earnings, managing costs, and continuing to provide real value to our clients, I am pleased to report that the company is in a very favorable position well into this current downturn. We are solidly profitable, have no debt, and have very large cash reserves. Brian, will provide more detail on our full year and fourth quarter 2008 financial results and our outlook for the first quarter of this year later in the call. Before he does I want to update you on several other important aspects of our business.  Having demonstrated consistent success in achieving the earnings goals we set, I want to reiterate that we remain focused on despite the current state of the economy the goal we set of reaching $100 million in annualized EBITDA run rate company wide by the end of 2010 or as soon as reasonably practical. Despite the current conditions we are facing, if positive GDP growth returns before 2010, I believe it is still possible to capture that growth and continue the successful track record of achieving earnings goals we have accomplished as a company. There is no question that the rest of 2009 will be extremely challenging. Like most companies, we have taken a number of steps to further stabilize our cost structure, minimize new spending and preserve value to help offset the negative impact on sales and revenue. These steps include temporarily freezing employee salaries company wide at their current levels and reducing the company match on employee contributions to the 401(k) plan in the US with a corresponding reduction in matching pension contributions in our international operations.  We believe we have taken and we will continue to take all necessary measures to address any decline in revenue or renewal rates we may see in the difficult year ahead. We will continue to monitor our position carefully and respond should a recovery fail to appear as expected next year. However, I believe the last thing we want to do in our position is to harm our business by reducing the quality or scope of our research product. Those of you who have followed our company for any length of time know that we invest for the long term and have managed our business conservatively over the past two years. As I have consistently stated over the years, researched and verified information is what sets CoStar apart. It's the basis of everything we do and our ability to deliver trusted and accurate information through up and down economic cycles has won us the business of virtually all the leading commercial real estate firms and thousands of smaller ones throughout the US and UK. In this environment, our clients are depending on us now more than ever to provide the highest quality information at the lowest possible cost, and that's exactly what we intend to do. That is why I want to make very clear that the recent cost reduction steps we are taking do not involve the curtailment of our research operations.  In fact because of continued unprecedented growth in the company's databases it will be necessary to grow the research team in 2009 in order to continue meeting customer expectations and maintain our clear competitive advantage. This modest increase and additional research headcount that we are considering does not fall into the category of discretionary spending. Considering that the record growth and expansion we experienced over the past two years resulted in unprecedented aggregation of content in CoStar's database. Our research team identified, confirmed and added literally hundreds of thousands of buildings and listings, resulting in amazing amount of growth and content that we managed. This record growth, which we believe will eventually translate to revenue growth, has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the size of our research staff. Despite achieving 100% plus increase in productivity gains on the part of our research team in covering the greatly expanded scope of our coverage, its clear that we need to realistically address the research resources we devote to ensuring that CoStar continues to provide the quality of information that has set us apart from competitors and been the key to our successful growth over the past 20 plus years. Certainly, keeping an eye on costs and minimizing spending are the watchwords of this recession, but even more important, I believe, is keeping the focus on our customers and ensuring that CoStar continues to provide the type and quality of information they expect. Currently, there are a dozen or so vendors out there providing marketing or information solutions to commercial real estate. Due to the extreme economic conditions, I believe that about half of those service providers will fail in the course of the next two years. Indeed, I believe the need to focus on the quality of our product may be more critical in this economy than during anytime of expansion. If you look at any successful mid-sized brokerage office, they are likely using two or three data providers. Now that their revenues have dropped many of these firms are facing the difficult choice of having to cut back to just one service. We are committed to making sure that CoStar remains the indispensable solution for our customers by providing an overwhelming quality advantage. We believe the commercial real estate information and marketing solutions we provide remain $1 billion business opportunity. It was before this recession and it will be after this recession. I believe it is both prudent and strategically advantageous to strengthen our position and further distance ourselves from weakened competitors. As we have experienced in previous downturns, the information available through CoStar plays a crucial role in helping our customers answer the fundamental questions when determining the value of their buildings and portfolios and in making their properties for lease and sale marketed more efficiently. Information is integral to facilitate real estate transactions and therefore integral to the real estate service providers' day-to-day business. Outsourcing, the labor-intensive and time consuming task of conducting basic real estate research to CoStar provides enormous benefit to our customers by providing them with higher quality information at a lower cost. Especially, when compared with the prospect of bringing research back in-house. Hiring additional staff and redirecting resources needed together confirm and maintain information on a continuous basis. Because our products help our customers improve productivity, cut cost and drive new revenues, we believe there will be continued strong demand for our services in a down market as long as we continue to provide the level and quality of information that set CoStar apart and won us the business of essentially every major firm in commercial real estate. Last night's announcement of a new multiyear tens of million dollars subscription contract renewal and expansion of Cushman & Wakefield, the largest privately held commercial real estate services firm in the world is proof of the utility nature of our product in any economic environment. You can be certain that Cushman & Wakefield did their due diligence on CoStar. If they did not believe in the value added to their firm is the direct results equipping research, evaluation and brokerage professionals with our information service and in a significant productivity gains that our service offers, they certainly would not have perceived with a sizable contract in this market. Under this new long-term agreement, Cushman & Wakefield will subscribe to additional CoStar services and have access to all CoStar US markets licensed by Cushman & Wakefield and the alliance firms. With initial term of four years followed by two three-year renewal option periods, the agreement carries a total potential term of ten years or until 2019. Along with a standard two-year non-compete clause that we include in such major contracts, the potential extent of the agreement is to 2021. Fees CoStar stands to earn under the expanded agreement or about one-third higher than the monthly rate under the previous 2004 agreement at its start. And includes fixed increases in years two, three and four, as well as trailing 12 month CPI escalations in each year of the renewal periods. Separately Cushman & Wakefield recently renewed their UK service agreement with us as well. CoStar welcomes the opportunity to continue to providing information services to Cushman & Wakefield and look forward to working closely with them for the next decade as their business grows under this expanded agreement. We have mentioned the current negative economic conditions in the commercial real estate market. What is a bit shocking, however, is the clear magnitude of the changes we are seeing. Consider employment, perhaps the most important driver absorption and demand for commercial real estate. After posting modest job losses in the most of 2008, job losses turned extremely negative. The US lost about 140,000 jobs a month through August of last year and in January 2009, we lost 598,000 jobs, the largest monthly decline since December 1974. And that comes on the heels of nearly equally large number of job losses in November and December. In total, the US lost 3 million jobs in 2008 and if current forecasts hold, we are looking at significant job losses this year as well, far exceeding what we saw in the dot com bust. Those of you who were tracking commercial real estate back then recalled that we saw approximately 46 million square feet of negative absorption in the US at the worst point during that cycle. It is likely; we will see dramatic negative absorption in US commercial real estate markets, probably 1 billion square feet over the next two years. Looking at just the office markets, essentially when a market looses job it losses 200 square feet of demand for office space. On a national level, the level of negative absorption, I would expect from this amount of job losses translates to at least an increase in the average office vacancy rate from 12% to about 15% overall by the end of 2009, 2010. Meanwhile, most lenders remained completely withdrawn from real estate and CMBS market [Technical Difficulty] secondary market for commercial mortgages and a source for replenishing lenders making loans for commercial property. CMBS spreads as recently as December 2008 were approximately 1400 basis points above LIBOR. A dramatic margin for those seeking financing for commercial real estate. As a result of all the above conditions, debt for commercial real estate remains extremely difficult to maintain. We are still in a frozen credit environment that is quite negative for commercial real estate. This situation is critical because if it continues and lenders remain on the sidelines, and large number of commercial real estate loans set to mature over the next 12 to 24 months will face extremely limited or no credit options to refinance which could result in a wave of defaults. [Technical Difficulty] financing in frozen debt markets, property sales have borne the brunt to the impact [Technical Difficulty] commercial real estate industry much more so than leasing market which tends to remain fairly steady through down markets. This sharp drop in sales activity has had a direct and extremely negative impact on the commissions brokerage firms earn. You may have seen yesterday's article in The Wall Street Journal on CB Richard Ellis. CBRE is one the best brokerage firms in the world capable of significantly outperforming lesser firms in a down market. CBRE's commission revenues dropped nearly $0.5 billion or 44% in 2008 over 2007, with more of that drop occurring in the later half of 2008. CBRE's commissions associated with the sale of commercial property dropped 65% year-over-year and commissions associated with leasing dropped 28%. For CoStar to grow revenue, 10% in this environment has been a significant testament to the strength of our business model. This is the worst drop I believe in marketing conditions I have seen in my two decades in the business. As you are likely aware CoStar's revenues are more driven by leasing marketplace which you can see is less negatively impacted. Vendors rely more heavily on commissions from sales activity are in a very tenuous position right now because the market is much more negatively impacted and will very likely not recover for at least four years. We have seen a disproportionate share of our increased cancel rate coming from the sales segment and lending segment of the market. Another primary trend we are seeing is a sharp drop-off in construction activity across all property types. New construction starts have all but ceased. It's likely that the most projects already under construction will top out and complete and the only activity going forward [Technical Difficulty], reflecting a balance of supply and demand going into the current downturn. As a result, we should see vacancy rates fall and rents and property values recover fairly quickly once employment and positive absorption returns. Again as I mentioned keep in mind that leasing activity tends to remain fairly resilient in any kind of market, much more so than property sales. [Technical Difficulty] Quite often, in fact, building owners offer incentives to brokers who bring them tenants or lease space in difficult markets. That certainly reflects in search activity inside of CoStar property professional which can be an indicator of future lease activity. Search activity in our information service has been fairly stable, indicating brokers are still out there searching for space for their clients. General consumer search activity on the Internet for commercial real estate also remained high. We are seeing about 1 million searches a month being conducted on costar.com using our CoStar Showcase service. It is important to keep in mind when analyzing national averages, while they provide a good indicator of general overall trends, wide variations in market conditions exist between individual markets. Some may be down dramatically, some may be fairly flat, and still others may be up dramatically. It is important when analyzing a specific market or asset to drill down to the market or even sub market level. Not all markets go into a cycle at the same time, come out of a cycle at the same time, or react the same in each cycle. CoStar products enable subscribers to analyze rents by market, submarket, even property class or for a specific set of selected buildings, enabling users to examine each market on its own, taking into account the economic drivers of the major impact of local market and submarket conditions. I expect we will continue to see dramatic changes in market conditions over the next few quarters as the full extent of the impact from the financial crisis becomes clearer. However, it is clear now that the business environment is fundamentally change and companies of all sizes and every industry will be grappling to the extent and severity of the crisis for some time.  Although intrinsic value we believe our information provides continues to be reflected in high overall customer renewal rates, the adverse economic conditions have had a negative impact on our customer base is reflected in that sales this past quarter, continuing a trend of slower quarterly revenue that we saw starting in the third quarter. Also again last quarter the evaluation of the relative value the Pound and Euro to the dollar has continued to reduce the value of our dollar reporting from international sales.  It's clear the recession's impact is being felt across a wider spectrum of clients for their predominance of cancellations are still focused among firms of significant exposure that plunged in number of property sales. Fortunately, CoStar's customer base is extremely diverse. Our largest client accounts for less than 4% of our total revenues. At the end of 2008, the company had 105 US subscription sales reps, eight US advertising sales reps, 10 in-house sales reps and 21 UK field sales reps for a total of 144 sales representatives. We intend to continue to grow this number just slightly in the first and second quarter of this year. Net US subscription contract bookings were $9.2 million for the full year. The average new contract value decreased 13% quarter-over-quarter from $6,642 to $5,805. The impact from adverse marketing conditions was also apparent in total subscriber account which only increased slightly year-over-year. The total number of paying subscribers in the fourth quarter 2008 was 89,712 compared to 88,751 for the fourth quarter 2007, a 1% year-over-year increase. The company executed agreements with 514 new subscribing firms during the fourth quarter 2008. Our 12-month trailing customer renewal rate for CoStar's subscription-based services was 89%. Renewal rates for customers who have subscribed to CoStar for more than three years remained in the mid 90s which is impressive given that we believe many of these firms saw 50% drops in their commission revenue. Firms who have been CoStar clients for more than three years appear to have renewal rate in excess of 95% where clients who have been there for less than three years have a renewal rate of approximately 70%. While this phenomenon is common in information services, we have moved quickly address this issue and provide our newest client with the training and guidance needed to gain a thorough understanding of our products and derive appropriate value from them. Among other things, we modified and added incentives to our sales commission program to make a significant portion of the account executives incentive payable not on contract signing but upon successfully getting most of the users at a new customer site using our service on a regular basis. We are also taking a number of additional steps that we believe should increase product usage with our new client sector, which we believe will result in increase in their subscription renewal rate and eventually our overall renewal rate, as well as an additional cross sale, up sale opportunities. Unfortunately, another result of a down market is that we are seeing an increase in attempts by a number of unscrupulous firms trying to obtain access of CoStar's services illegally rather than paying for them. We continue to make substantial progress this past quarter in our ongoing efforts to protect our intellectual property and paying subscribers from those who seek to obtain fraudulent gain access to our information or who otherwise use our information our images illegally. As previously reported, we have an established internal anti-piracy group that uses extensive fraud detection technology to continually monitor CoStar's online information products to detect and prevent unauthorized access. In 2008 and year-to-date 2009, CoStar's anti-piracy team has brought in nearly $1 million in out-of-court settlements with firms engaged in password sharing and assigned new agreements proper licensing previously unauthorized users with an aggregate value of approximately $900,000 in annualized revenue. As a matter of policy, CoStar intends to continue to prosecute individuals and firms that engage in this unlawful activity. To the extent that such theft constitutes a crime, CoStar intends to work with appropriate law enforcement to bring the perpetrators to justice. I would also like to briefly update you on the status of CoStar's false advertising lawsuit against LoopNet which was filed February 2008 in Federal Court in New York City. As you will recall, our complaint alleges that among other false advertising claims, LoopNet is grossly overstating the size of its online audience by continuing to advertise that it has more than 3 million registered users who are supposedly immediately exposed to paid listings on LoopNet's website. Now the contradicting truth about LoopNet's registered members has come out in open court. Under court order, LoopNet disclosed that 2.1 million of its claimed 3 million plus registered users never logged on to the LoopNet web site over the one year period ending mid January 2009. Even more damming, 94% of its claimed number of registered members did not log on over a 30 day period from mid December 2008 to mid January 2009. LoopNet's audience claims that are predicated on registered members who apparently do not log on to their website stands in sharp contrast the practice of site such as Facebook who only claim as an audience the number of members that log in at a 30 day period. Obviously we feel vindicated by LoopNet revelation of the truth actual size of their online audience. Unfortunately, it has not have the intended effect of making LoopNet stop making fraud claims about the size of their audience. Since it has claimed to have is a 3 million active users was discredited in Federal Court, LoopNet in the marketplace is claiming to have multiple times more traffic than the next largest web site in the industry. However, to produce these comparative audience metrics, LoopNet is relying on a consumer-focused panel comp score and Internet audience estimating method that tends to favor non-business websites to the consumer focused composition of their panels. As a result of this consumer skewed composition, panels such as ComScore may under guestimate web site that cater to a business audience such as CoStar.com. Even that our marketing efforts are geared towards driving a qualified business audience to our subscriber listings, we feel strongly if these competitive ComScore numbers are mostly irrelevant for a site like CoStar.com and unique services like Showcase.  The clearest concrete example of how dubious these new claims are is the ComScore traffic is only an estimate while LoopNet's log on activity is a fact. LoopNet's log on activity is only 25% of LoopNet's claimed ComScore traffic. So despite the bragadacio or the pinocchio without the benefit of this cricket, the reality of their business is in fact diminutive. We believe that our competing service CoStar Showcase with as many advantages to brokers and Internet users can win in any fair competition, (inaudible) by flaw misleading audience claims. And we plan to continue our efforts ensure that commercial estate professionals have all the information they need to make informed decisions about which service will best service their needs. We launched Showcase just last May and already we are fast approaching the $3 million mark in annualized sales. Showcase is also now a profitable product, because it does not required the same research investment as our information based products. Not only is Showcase an earnings positive business for CoStar, but more importantly, it has proven to be a major hit with our clients. We are receiving more and more testimonials from customers telling us of a tour they just gave, or a deal they closed as a result of prospect finding them on Showcase. Showcase is proving to be an extremely valuable tool for commercial brokers who are looking to maintain their flow of tenant and buyer leads in a time when traditional channels are drying up. Total search volume on Showcase was up 50% during the fourth quarter, increasing from 1.9 million searches in the third quarter to 2.9 million in the fourth quarter. And property views increased as well during the same period from 58 million property views to 61 million. Additionally, we have seen consistent quarter-over-quarter increases in the number of unique visitors to CoStar.com following the product launch. Another key indicator that Showcase is becoming increasingly popular among people searching the Internet for commercial property. We believe this will directly translate into stronger results for Showcase subscribers by generating more property views and leads. We have been able to achieve growth in our unique visitor traffic, property views and leads generated while maintaining a fairly consistent marketing investment. Using intensive and ongoing search engine optimization efforts, which involve various methods we use to capture more free traffic from major search engines like Google and Yahoo! The percentage of traffic generated from free organic search results was over 100% higher represent generate when we first launched the product in the second quarter of 2008. While we plan to continue to invest in paid search marketing efforts on behalf of our clients, a key benefit that we believe really helps set us apart competitors in this space, we believe that the addition of these free links on the organic results generated by the search engines only bolsters Showcase's position as a pre eminent place to advertise listings online. We believe the extraordinary demonstration of acceptance and use of Showcase in such a short period of time is a testament to its overall success and provides the most effective platform available to commercial real estate professionals for generating leads from a tens of thousands of business professionals who search the Internet each day for available commercial real estate. In addition to the obvious appeal, researchers of the continuously updated listing information afforded by CoStar's extensive research operations, Showcase does not require searchers to register, join memberships to search for available lease or for sale property list on Showcase. And unlike many other sites, Showcase does not pepper searchers with endless pop-ups and registration requirements. We believe both property marketers and searchers favor the unrestricted and frictionless search format available on Showcase. And in the end could result in more leads for our clients. Finally a big advantage for Showcase subscribers is that the service does not require additional upkeep and maintenance on their part. Their CoStar research analyst simply contacts them for the regular update as usual and the verified listing information is automatically displayed throughout CoStar's products, including Showcase, eliminating the need for any additional data entry on the broker's part. Ultimately this rapidly growing service expands our company's focus more directly than ever into the marketing side of the commercial real estate business. For more than 20 years, our clients have thought of CoStar as being their research partner. Now with Showcase, we've taken a major step to positioning CoStar as their marketing partner as well, and the timing couldn’t be better. We believe that Showcase is a product that is countercyclical and it helps brokers' leads inexpensively and ultimately helps them to generate quality leads at a lower cost than other marketing alternatives. Proof of this countercyclicity is that we had our best month ever in advertising revenue in January. Jim Blackman and his advertising team that sells preferred position within our subscription products sold nearly 0.5 million in advertising revenue in January. We believe this is exactly the lead generation remedy brokers are looking for in a down market. Our research operations have continued to perform exceedingly well. Our research team provides the core data as a source of our value and identity as a company. They continue to do an outstanding job in researching all the markets we cover and demonstrate their value by adding listings and confirming their accuracy in extremely efficient and timely manner. All told, these assets ensure that CoStar offers what we believe to be the most comprehensive and accurate data of commercial property in the US and UK. 3.2 million properties, now 9 billion square feet of space available, over 1.2 million listings, over 1 trillion in listing value in our system currently for our clients, 7.4 million images, and information on 5.7 tenants. Finally I want to expand on my earlier comment that we believe the research team will grow slightly this year in order to continue to meet customers' expectation. Research productivity has increased more than 100% over the last year or so, but at some level of listing growth, headcount must increase somewhat. As we stated in the press release issued yesterday, our strategy going forward is to remain focused on building and growing innovative research, information market research for Commercial as a clients throughout the US and UK. Despite the near-term challenges, we see opportunity in the current environment to capitalize on our existing research assets to introduce new products and services and expand our business in key areas, while position a company for accelerated growth when this recession ends. One of the areas we intend to focus on is the expansion of CoStar's analytic capabilities. That has been a strategic goal for us for the past few years. Following the withdraw of our offer to acquire Reese, a New York based commercial information provider, we stated our intention to focus on further developing our own analytics service rather than pursuing acquisition of Reese. Thousands of our clients recently participated in the recent series of webinars we conducted on the changing market conditions and the clients' positive response underscores the demand for CoStar to expand our role as a data provider and provide clients with additional market analysis and insight. 90% of the webinar participants said they would be interested in attending future events. In addition benefiting from CoStar's superior research and market coverage, we believe our subscribers would dive addition of the more enhanced analytic module within CoStar property professional. We intend to pursue that option in the near future, and we believe it will be very well received. Before finally turning the call over to Brian Radecki, CoStar's Chief Financial Officer for a more in-depth discussion of financial performance and outlook, let me reiterate that we are very focused on managing our business, minimizing new spending, and preserving value to continue to operate profitably in this economic environment. We believe that the fact that we grew 10% and posted record earnings to what is certainly the worst recession in two generations reflects the strong fundamentals for our business. Our products provide great value to our customers. Our financial position is solid and based on long-term investments that we expect will continue to generate additional revenue opportunities. I am confident that we will manage our expenses, continue to have the resources we need to operate our business and invest in areas that offer the greatest possibility for delivering long-term value to our customers and shareholders and opportunity to our employees and additional growth opportunities for CoStar Group. Thank you, Brian?
Brian Radecki: Thank you and you can take a breath. As Andy mentioned earlier during Q4, CoStar posted another strong quarter of earnings growth in cash generation. In yesterday's press release, we provided adjusted results for 2007 in that of the Q4, 2007 one-time lease settlement gain. We believe these adjusted 2007 results provide a better basis of comparing full year and fourth quarter 2008 results. Our net income for the fourth quarter 2008 increased 96.5% to $7.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share from $3.8 million, or $.20 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2007, excluding the fourth quarter 2007's one-time lease settlement gain. EBITDA, which is our earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter 2008 was $16.7 million, an increase of 82.3%, compared to EBITDA of 9.2 for the fourth quarter 2007, again excluding the one-time lease element gain. Reconciliation of EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to GAAP basis results shown in detail in our press release issued yesterday. The press release is available on our web site at www.costar.com. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 increased sequentially approximately $125,000 compared to the third quarter 2008 excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on International revenues. In the fourth-quarter 2008 alone, the unfavorable impact from quarter-over-quarter changes in exchange rates totaled approximately $1 million on a functional currency basis, US revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $48.2 million compared to $48 million in the third quarter of 2008, and International revenues 3 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2008, consistent with the third quarter of 2008. International operations contributed 9% of total revenues in the fourth quarter and international subscription revenues accounted for approximately 89.2% of this revenue in Q4 of 2008. In Q4 of 2008, non-subscription based revenue, which is ad hoc revenue that is mostly related to services that facilitate the buying and selling of commercial buildings continue to be extremely weak. We do not expect this type of non-subscription-based revenue to improve for many, many quarters given the current market conditions, but as most of you probably know, this type of non-subscription based revenue accounts for less than 5% of CoStar's total revenues unlike other competitors in our space. CoStar's subscription revenues actually accounted for 95.7% of our total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008. Turning to our renewal rate, which is a measure of renewing subscription revenue, our 12-month trailing renewal rate remains strong at 89%. We consider the 12-month trailing customer renewal rate to be a good indicator of the strength of our business model as subscription revenues account for the most of our revenue, and the majority of our subscribers on annual agreements. All in all, we believe this type of renewal rate is still very healthy based on where we are today with regard to the economy. And clearly is heads and tails above most of the other public companies that I am aware of. As I have publicly stated for the past year or so, we do expect the 12-month trailing renewal rate to continue to decline in this type of environment that we are currently in to the mid-80s this year. As Andy stated earlier after announcing the Q2 goal of 2007 of 30% EBITDA margin in the US and breakeven in the UK before the end of the year, we have once again delivered on that goal. Our international operations finished the fourth quarter above breakeven, and our US operations powered on tallying 34.5% EBITDA margin. In addition, the fourth quarter we actually surpassed the 30% EBITDA margin for consolidated US and International operations, a longstanding goal for the company most of you are aware of. Our consolidated EBITDA margin in Q4 was 31.6%. Now we are focused on the 2009 plan and outlook, and also remain focused on the longer-term goal of working towards achieving the goal we set out in the second quarter of 2008 much like the goal we set out in the second quarter of 2007 to $100 million in annualized EBITDA run rate by the end of 2010. We believe this goal is achievable based on our strong subscription-based business model even as we face a very difficult economic and commercial real estate environment in 2009, assuming conditions begin to recover by this time next year. Once we start seeing positive GDP growth again, we expect to return to the more normalized revenue growth rates we have enjoyed over the past decade, which we expect should result in margin expansion up to the $100 million in EBITDA goal as a majority of the revenue drops from the top line to the bottom line. We continue to expect to add new subscribers, renew current subscribers and generate strong earnings through this challenging economic environment. Now let's discuss gross margin, which decreased by approximately $900,000 from $31.6 million in Q3 to $35.2 million in Q4 2008 mainly due to the decrease in revenues of approximately $800,000 coupled with a slight increase in cost of revenues of $100,000. Gross margins was 66.5% in Q4 of 2008. Moving to expenses for the quarter, overall operating was $22.4 million in Q4 2008, a decrease of $2.5 million from $24.9 million in Q3 of 2008. This decrease resulted from lower sales commissions as our net new revenue was moderate in Q4. Some other reductions in marketing and travel and legal costs in the fourth quarter also contributed to the decrease in operating expenses. Legal expenses for the fourth quarter were approximately $800,000. We consider these legal costs like most other public companies to be normal recurring costs, which we anticipate will continue for the foreseeable future. As you are aware, we are currently involved in several lawsuits and could be involved in others to protecting our intellectual property rights. As always, we follow US GAAP basis accounting and report all of our legal expenses in our income statement, EBITDA, and in our earnings outlook for the year. With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter of 2008 with approximately $224.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, an increase of $37.2 million since December 31, 2007 and have no long-term debt. In the fourth quarter 2008 alone, we added over $11 million in cash and investments. On a full-year basis, 2008, net income increased 144.9% to $24.6 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, compared to $10 million or $0.52 per diluted share for 2007 excluding 2007's one-time lease gain. EBITDA 2008 increased 114.5% compared to EBITDA of 2007 of 26.4% net of the one-time lease gain. Total revenues as Andy said, were $212.4 million, an increase of 10.2% over revenues of $192.8 million in 2007. Now I will conclude my remarks with the outlook of the first quarter and full year 2009 in detail. As always our guidance takes into account recent growth rates, and our results may be impacted by the uncertainties around foreign exchange fluctuations as well as changes in the global economy. We have attempted to reflect global weak in the economy in our guidance, but recognize that we are in a period of significant flux and cannot predict the direction of various market factors. However, we remain confident in our earnings guidance as we believe that one of the key strengths of our subscription-based business model is that it provides good earnings visibility even in a very difficult environment. As explained in our press release, we are providing revenue guidance separately for our US and international operations given the uncertainties around the exchange rate fluctuations. In the US, we expect first quarter 2009 revenue in the range of $47 million to $48 million and international revenue in the range of $2.7 million to $2.9 million in British pounds. For the full year 2009, we expect US revenue in the range of $185 million to $190 million, and international revenues in the range of $11.5 million to $12 million British pounds. Given the unprecedented economic environment, our actual first quarter and full-year 2009 revenue results could differ slightly from our guidance. In more detail, let me talk about the rest of the P&L. We expect cost of revenues, which was approximately $17.7 million in Q4 to rise slightly throughout the year to approximately $18.8 million by the end of 2009, which relates to the variable timing differences for new hires in research in other research-related costs. If you go back to the last two conference calls, I will remind everybody that half of the decrease in cost of revenues, $1.4 million that I pointed out in Q2 and 700,000 in Q3, I stated was only temporary. As Andy stated earlier, we expect to focus our efforts continually on striving to increase the quality of research. And therefore, we will expect to continue and hire and staff the research group to provide the highest quality information to meet the needs of our clients during this difficult environment. There is no new investment here, just more focus on keeping the staffing levels where they should be. Selling and marketing should remain flat or slightly down in 2009, compared to 2008. Software development should remain fairly consistent and flat in 2009 compared to 2008. G&A is expected to increase slightly. $1 million to $1.5 million annually, year-over-year mainly due to increase bad debt in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the current economic environment, which we are seeing an increase in the number of businesses failing or filing for bankruptcy. We also expect the interest rate for our interest income to be approximately 0.5% to 0.8% in 2009. Please note the majority of our approximately $225 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments currently in cash or assets invested in US treasuries or other U.S. Government money market funds. Therefore we expect $3 million today $4 million less in interest income in 2009, compared to 2008. Just this morning I saw an e-mail saying that currently the fed funds rate is at 0.15, with the fed funds target a range of 0 to 0.25 as I am sure most of you are aware. As we continue to invest internationally, the mechanics of our effective tax rate calculation continues to be affected by the amount of income or loss in the UK. The tax expense or benefit from the UK operations is not equivalent to the tax rates of our US operations, which can have an impact on our overall blended effective rate. Overall, we expect our effective rate to be approximately 45% for 2009. In terms of earnings, we expect the first quarter 2009 fully diluted net income per share of approximately $0.28 to $0.30. For the full year 2009, we expect fully diluted net income per share of approximately $1 to $1.05, which includes approximately $5.5 million in pretax, non-cash equity compensation charges related to the divesting of restricted stock and stock options. We also expect capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately $4 million to $7 million, including investments in facilities to upgrade several field hub sales offices, so network equipment and workstations to upgrade and support the ongoing operations. In conclusion, the entire CoStar management team remains focused and fully committed to achieving our new outlook for 2009. We fully expect to manage the business through this current environment and to capitalize on our stable subscription based business model to position us for long-term growth opportunities and to work toward our long-term goal of $100 million of annualized EBITDA. Once again, we believe our Q4 results demonstrate our commitment to delivering on long-term goals that we set out, just as we have many, many times before as a public company. Economic conditions could worsen, but we believe we are prepared to weather this economic cycle. We also believe our services our core to our clients' ability to deliver on their businesses and that the market need for our services remains resilient, as evidenced by the Cushman & Wakefield agreement signed yesterday. Our business model remains strong and the fact that we have a 95% subscription based business with high renewal rates, we have a unique proprietary database with a market-leading position, the strong balance sheet, no debt and high cash flow. We also believe these challenging times will continue to create opportunities for us as a market leader. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for additional high margin revenue growth following the investments we have made, and with addition of new services like CoStar Showcase. As we have explained many times, CoStar is not immune to the challenges facing the economy today, but without a doubt 2009 will be a tough year, but we are clear about our priorities and confident in our plans. We continue to look forward to reporting that progress to you. And with that, I open up the, operator call for question.
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). The first question will come from John Neff from William Blair. Please go ahead.  
John Neff - William Blair: Hi, guys.
Andy Florance:  Hi, John. 
John Neff - William Blair: Andy, I just want to make sure I got a couple of things right that you said, I think you referenced to 100% growth in research productivity during, I think 2008. Can you just talk about how you define that?
Andy Florance: Sure. Actually in the two-year period, the listing account grew I believe 240% and researcher headcount grew 13%. So a huge productivity gain over a two-year period, and that was achieve through continuing improvements in software, the integration of the comparable sale research team, the tenant team and the listing team made it much more efficient, call recording systems for better coaching of the researchers. But at some point, there is sort of unprecedented growth in the database requires you to realistically, not continuously count on productivity gains to be able to increase workload. So, still are meeting the quality expectations we want, but we just want to make sure we continue to do that.  
Brian Radecki: 
 : We happen to end the year at the low end into that range. And I think again, I encourage everyone to go back to the last two transcripts. I mean I pointed out fairly specifically the numbers in saying that half of that was temporary. I think the goal and focus this year as Andy said is to make sure that we are providing the highest quality research, so we do expect to actually continually push that number up to the high end into that range to provide that quality to our clients.  
John Neff - William Blair: No, I appreciate that. And then, one thing, Andy, I am not sure if I heard you right as well. I think you talked about, were you projecting 1 billion square feet of negative absorption over the next two years? Did I hear that right, number one? And then number two, could you compare that to the magnitude of whatever you did say to prior downturns?
Andy Florance: Sure, okay. That is a number across all types of real estate. All types of commercial real estate. Not just the office sector, but that's right. I mean we are talking about big numbers here. So, if you lose 6 million jobs, that's going to have a significant negative impact on absorption. And by comparison, I think, during the dot-com bust, the worst quarter for office only leasing was, $37 million, negative absorption. So, order of magnitude sort of increased in negative absorption.  
John Neff - William Blair: And then, I was wondering, you mentioned a couple of things. But could you describe the types of specific analytics products you envision delivering in the next, call it 12 to 18 months? And then what has to be done/spent to deliver those products?  
Andy Florance: Good question and I am going to remain somewhat vague for all those competitors listening to the call today. What we are basically doing is, we are redirecting a lot of our systems resources or software developer resources towards continuously releasing incremental upgrades to our product that makes the utility of our products more valuable to people who are trying to value, analyze commercial real estate assets. So it's going to be a whole series of incremental upgrades giving you more indicators on the real estate markets, giving you tie-in from our commercial real estate data to related streams of data. We are also going to be, for instance, the webinar series that we recently hosted, we had several thousand people participate where we did 90 minute sessions by product type reviewing commercials real estate market conditions. I did the office sector one. I would like to bring in people other than myself to do this, and begin to bring in some econ on top, economists to interpret all the information that is in our system for our customers, as well as to add forecasting to our products. So, incremental spend is, I don't really think there is an incremental increase in software development cost associated with this. And we are talking about probably less than half a dozen additional personnel. So there is more a change of focus than it's been on cost of investment.
John Neff - William Blair: Yeah. So this is very incremental to your cost base?
Andy Florance: Right. It will make us much more competitive in that space though. 
John Neff - William Blair: The ad sales that you mentioned in January, I think 500,000, was that essentially preferred property listings on the Showcase/CoStar.com platform. Was that part of the $3 million in annualized sales for Showcase or was that categorized differently?  
Andy Florance: No, categorized differently. Jim Black, the person you said, the namesake of Black's Guide, for the last several years has been leading an advertising sales team that sells preferred placement within our professional products, so that the brokerage community, when they do a search for space available in a given area, advertised properties within our professional product will come to the top of the results and get additional exposure to the brokers. So that 0.5 million in sales in January, product that has been out there for several years. That is not Showcase. That is separate and distinct from Showcase but it shows the counter-cyclicality. If you are sitting on 100,000 square feet of class A space you hope to lease for $55 a foot and it's not leasing, you go buy an ad for a couple hundred bucks or a couple thousand dollars. 
John Neff - William Blair: You gave the net bookings number for the year I think it's 9.2 million. Just doing the math, it was about 100,000 net in the fourth quarter? 
Brian Radecki: Yeah. It was positive in the fourth quarter. 
John Neff - William Blair: Okay. And then I can get back in queue, but maybe one more before I do that. In terms of thinking about the guidance, the first quarter guidance to take the midpoint you get about $1.16 annualized in '09 EPS. Your guidance is $1 to $1.05. Just wondering what that is, is that a reflection of the renewal rates over the course of the year continuing to move down to that mid-80s level on a trailing 12-month basis, a function of gross sales, or is it expense, you are clearly expecting things to get worse as the year progresses. 
Andy Florance: Yes, I think it is a function of kind of everything that you said. I think obviously I have been saying it for a long time, and I think we are seeing it happen. We do expect the trailing 12-month renewal rate to decline this year to the mid-80s. Obviously I think that's going to put pressure on revenue hence the guidance ranges that we gave basically flat or down slightly. So, again, we don't know how bad that is going to get. We will have to factor all that into our guidance.  In addition to the other areas we talked about, I do expect the cost of sales line to increase slightly as we try to basically stay fully staffed. We have a lot lower turnover that we have ever had, part of it is the economy and part of it is the great job that the research group is doing. So we would expect to stay at more full staffing levels, so you will see that number come back up to what I would say is the more normalized rate which is again what I have kind of communicated in the last couple of quarters.  I do expect to see increasing bad debt, John. I think it is unrealistic. When I look at, my days of sales are up 19.7 up to 22.3 from Q3 to Q4. Bad debt is up also, so I think it is prudent for me to guide to higher bad debt. There is just more companies going bankrupt. I think we have to factor that in.  And then obviously the interest which I explained. The interest is basically almost zero. We have longer-term instruments out there that are still helping push our number up a little bit, but I expect that to decline even with an increasing cash balance this year. So, some of it to me is very mechanical as far as the interest goes. That really has nothing to do with the core operations. But I think, it's pretty prudent guidance. There is a lot of companies that aren't coming out with annual guidance at all, which I don't necessarily agree with. So, I think obviously we are trying to do the best we can in this type of environment. 
John Neff - William Blair: Last question and then I will get back in queue. You mentioned the typical annual term for the subscription. Is the fourth quarter, first, can you remind us of the seasonality of the renewals. Is it typically concentrated in the fourth quarter or the first quarter? And what kind of advanced notice are you requiring from customers from a renewal or a cancellation standpoint? 
Andy Florance: Sure. It is basically fairly smooth throughout the year. It is slightly higher in the first quarter, and typically they would have to have at least two-month notice. 
John Neff - William Blair: Great, thanks so much. 
Andy Florance: Alright. Thanks, John 
Operator: And our next question is from Jon Maietta from Needham and Company. 
Jonathan Maietta - Needham and Company: Thanks very much. Brian, just to piggyback off of John's question there. When thinking about kind of revenue linearity across the year, let's assume the economy stays as is for sake of argument, would it be fair to assume you kind of see a down sequential Q1, Q2, maybe some stabilization in the revenue line in Q3 and, you know, maybe we get an uptick in Q4. Is that kind of a rational way to think of about it? 
Brian Radecki: I think it is pretty rational if you actually look at like the guidance essentially, I am guiding down in the first quarter only by, you can look at the range, couple hundred thousand dollars or so. So I think I am expecting, companies are going to go bankrupt are not going to make it until the end of the year. So realistically, if I am projecting I am thinking that the majority that will struggle are going to go out bankruptcy early in the year and obviously we do hope to see some recovery as we get through closer to the end of the year. So I think that’s a good way to look at it. 
Jonathan Maietta - Needham and Company: Okay. And then Andy, maybe you can talk about the customer base a little bit and maybe incorporate some of Brian's comments there in your feedback with regard to bankruptcies. With the greatest preponderance of those bankruptcies, do you think kind of be with some of these property owners who have levered up in the past when debt was cheap, as well as some of the smaller brokers maybe closing their doors for business as well? 
Andy Florance: Yes, there is a definite pattern to the folks who are going bankrupt. It's not your established. Obviously the established brokerage firms of the mid to upper size are under severe pressure. It's the folks who predominantly deal with buying and selling Commercial real estate at the middle and lower end who are just getting killed and they are going bankrupt or the folks who are originating commercial real estate mortgages, smaller entrepreneurial operations there being decimated. We actually had two cancellations in that area where the customers took their lives, where they were involved in some speculative stuff some investment stuff and got hammered.  So, you are seeing some brokerage firms where they have speculative development as part of the firm who are in trouble. We don't have a lot of exposure to the owners who over-levered. That is a smaller part of our business. The very good news here is that our biggest exposure is to brokerage firms that do leasing for living. And while that area is under duress, they are not experiencing anything like what these other sectors are experiencing. 
Jonathan Maietta - Needham and Company: Okay. And then any material change in some of the other customer sectors build in the past couple of months whether appraisers, government agencies. 
Andy Florance: Well, the government is growing. The appraisers I think should actually do okay, because with values moving all over the place, people are more interested than ever in what the value of a corporation's assets are. So, I think the appraiser will do okay in this situation, and I would hope that our government business grows over the next year or so. 
Jonathan Maietta - Needham and Company: Okay. And then Brian, just a couple of items with regard to cash flow, do you happen to have what CapEx and cash from operations was in Q4? 
Brian Radecki: Yes, CapEx was pretty low, about 0.5 million. We closed the year a little bit lower than 4 million or something like that. Cash flow from ops is in the 30 million plus or so. I don't have the exact number with me, but when we will be filing our 10K on Friday or Monday at the latest, so we can get all the exact numbers in there. 
Jonathan Maietta - Needham and Company: Okay. And that's it for me. Thanks very much. 
Andy Florance:  Thanks, Jon. 
Operator: And the next question is from Jim Wilson from JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Hi, good morning, guys. 
Andy Florance: Good morning, Jim. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Let's see, a couple of things, two-three things here. You gave the number of new accounts generated at 514 for Q4. 
Andy Florance: Yes. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Do you have a number for how many you lost? 
Andy Florance: We do not. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: More than 514 or less? 
Andy Florance: Just like with sales, I think sales was up slightly for the quarter. I don't have the exact number, Jim, but sales were up for the quarter, even net new bookings were still positive and client ads were positive. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: So, you didn't necessarily see yet out of Q4 that loss has exceeded ads. You are just expecting that given obviously the (inaudible) market conditions and what you are seeing or hearing from clients. 
Andy Florance: Correct. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Yes, that kind of make sense. Are you expecting any meaningful change, I am guessing you might spend less at ICSC this year? 
Andy Florance: Well, yes.
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Or are you even going? 
Andy Florance: ICSC, what? No, we actually, Jim, it's a good question. We are reducing our presence. You will not see a 10 storey Billboard on the hotel across the street from the convention center this year. We are definitely spending less money, but last year we actually sold more in annual subscriptions than we spent at the show. So, the show is profitable on an absolute basis. So we can't walk away from it. We got to participate. We made money there. 
Brian Radecki: We are still participating I think we are obviously just trimming back a little bit of some of the expenses but we will still be there. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Sounds good, alright. 
Andy Florance: Sorry to waste your time, but I think we used to give away portions as a draw and then a two-year lease, now we are doing a weekend rental. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Okay. Then the final thing, just on your cash. I know you are asked this plenty of times. Any thoughts on anything you might do? Is this the point in time you might even look to buy stock back? Or what do you think of acquisitions. Obviously the [re-steel] or there won't be [re-steel] went away but what do you think of anything you can do with cash to drive a higher return? 
Andy Florance: We still are very optimistic about the ability to, opportunistically take advantage of some potential acquisitions out there. There are companies that will take a beating that don't have a strong balance sheet in this downturn. That could have real value to the company. We want to keep an eye on that and see what emerges. I think it is still a little early right now. So again, we constantly re-evaluate whether or not to do a share buyback or to do something else with the cash, but given the extreme uncertainty in the market right now, it is likely we are going to sit tight for a little bit. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Okay. 
Andy Florance: But there are some interesting things out there. 
James Wilson - JP Morgan Securities: Alright, thanks. 
Andy Florance: Thanks, Jim. 
Operator: The next question is from Chris Mammone from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Hi, guys. 
Andy Florance: Hi, Chris, how are you doing?
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Good. First to be clear about the revenue guidance. The guidance isn't predicated on any sort of back half recovery. Just something you are hopeful to see at this point in time, right. 
Andy Florance: I don't think we are terribly optimistic about recovery in 2009. I don't see that happening. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Sort of a follow-up to that. You made some comments on 2010 and hoping that GDP returns to positive territory. Where you sit today, is there anything that you are seeing that makes you optimistic that could happen or is that just sort of drawing a line in the sand there. Can you maybe flesh that out a little bit your comments on 2010? 
Andy Florance: Well, I would defer to the Federal Reserve on the outlook for 2010. So based on our experience with the '90s, I would say it is safe to say that the investing side of commercial real estate, the buying and selling of assets will not recover in 2010. It will not recover in 2011, and probably won't recover until 2012. The leasing marketplace will be the first to recover, and it will recover once employment losses stop. You will have a reasonably quick recovery because you don't have a lot of excess inventory. So, '09 will be negative. And, it is out of my pay grade to forecast the GDP in '10. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Any sense I guess what are your expectations for what Showcase will continue to the top-line this year? 
Andy Florance: Fairly optimistic. We are not prepared to talk about it, but we have some innovative new ways to sell the product, and I think it will be a great year for CoStar Showcase, and I think it will keep the revenues moving in a very-very extraordinary difficult time. And Showcase has been most successful product launch we have ever had as far as that goes and continues to be, and we do expect it to be all of '09. Chris you took the one-time gain out last year so don't put it back in for the year-over-year comparison. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Right. Okay. And I think you mentioned your add a little bit to the sales force in the first half. About how many heads are you guys expecting to add back?  
Andy Florance: I think 10. 10 to 15, somewhere in that, hopefully good ones. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Yes. And then any issues with, I guess, you mentioned you have very low turnover, was that just the research staff or is that sort of sales and research everybody else got out of the year.  
Andy Florance: That's across the board, the research turnover is extremely low and generally turnover is very low as one would expect. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Right. Alright, and then, go ahead. 
Brian Radecki: Good news also there are great candidates out there. As we bring in these new sales positions, there is some really good talent out there. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Okay. I guess lastly just on the UK. I know it's relatively small part of the business still, but just looking at the last few quarters, has revenue really plateaued in that market or is it more. 
Andy Florance: Absolutely not, Christy. I think my sense of things is that the UK, commercial real estate market went into this downturn a full two quarters ahead of the United States. And so I think the brokerage community over there the surveyors got hit a lot earlier than the US did. And actually I think we are seeing some signs of recovery in our sales in the UK right now. My belief, if you compare our revenues, we have accomplished a lot in the UK that wouldn't show up in revenues in 2008. Like we went from 30,000 listings at the beginning of '07 to 100,000 listings at the end of '08.  As I met with our biggest customers in the UK in the fourth-quarter 2008, we have gone from being regarded as a small sort of optional vendor in that market to becoming clearly the best, highest-quality provider of information service to the industry over there and absolute utility. And if you take the, our experience of generating revenue per millions of square feet in a given market, I would expect that market can quadruple and can grow tenfold over the next ten years or so. So, I think that will be a bright spot to the company over the next decade. 
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank : Great. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. 
Andy Florance: Thanks, Chris 
Operator: Your next question is from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks a lot. On the number of sales reps, it looks like it dropped from about 170 a year ago to 144 most recently. But you also mentioned that the turnover is very low. I assume that's across the entire business. So, is that reduction mainly a reflection of the cost-cutting efforts and reaction to reduce selling opportunities during the slump, is that what we are seeing there? 
Andy Florance: A little bit of that. Given the very large number of markets we have released in the last two years, we are moving a little bit more to slightly more hub and spoke sales system. We are going to be concentrating not trying to put our salespeople into every single MSA out there in the United States, but rather than centralizing them and a couple of dozen. It got dozen or so offices around the country. So a transition going on there. We have a significant number of sales reps in training right now who will be in centralized locations. 
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Got it. And any plans to hedge the foreign exchange exposure. A lot of people expect the dollar to continue to strengthen which would leave you susceptible to additional unfavorable FX impacts. Any thoughts there? 
Andy Florance: Actually we did the work. We have got some money in several different International banks that we spoke to, RBC, HSBC, and I have gotten four or five different report. I have got one report of it going down to 1.1, another report going up to 1.6. I think currently we are at 1.4 something. So, I still think there is a lot of uncertainty going in both directions. So, I think right now we will stay put. But we have hedged in the past. So, obviously we will watch it carefully and if we feel like it is appropriate, it is something that we will consider.  
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:  Okay, got it. And a final question from me. You mentioned as an example how CB Richard Ellis has reduced numbers that they have seen the past year. Can you comment on how lower activity levels in general could impact your ability to gather data and keep it up to date? Are there any special considerations there on your operations as we move through this cycle?  
Andy Florance:  Yeah, well, actually it will be kind of easier to collect the data. There will be more volume of it. So, people are more motivated now than ever to make sure that they are putting their information into our system, and that is great. We are continuing to see our 'for sale' listings and our lease listings information boom, and our success is part of the reason we have to actually add a few more researchers because they are being very forthcoming and talking us to too much.  
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley:

Andy Florance: Thank you. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We do have a follow-up from John Neff. Please go ahead.
John Neff - William Blair: Hey, guys. 
Andy Florance:
 : John, you always like to open and close these calls, right? 
John Neff - William Blair: I try my best.
Andy Florance:
 : Okay. 
John Neff - William Blair: Brian, I was wondering if you could just comment on the status of your NOL carry forwards are going to be a full cash taxpayer in 2009, what the status there is? Andy, I was wondering if you could comment on what, if any, inroads you are seeing from Xceligent given the funding of that company from one of your competitors in recent quarters? Thank you.
Brian Radecki: Sure. We have utilized our NOL. You know, after many, many years, we actually utilize all of them in the U.S.; it will be full cash in the U.S. We obviously have a bunch of NOLs in the U.K. that will be able to utilize over the coming years. So, again, it will be kind of that blended rate. It will look a little bit higher than the actual cash taxes that they are paying. Even at 45% will be paying cash taxes at something just South of 40% or less because of the U.K., U.S. differences. 
Andy Florance: And, John, to answer your question, I believe that the competitor you are referring to. There are rumors they have launched a service in Winter Harbor, Maine and in Osceola, Iowa, but that it will be up and running shortly. But in markets like, San Diego, California, and I am being somewhat facetious. I think a press release about Little Rock and another market that would not be in the top 100 U.S. MFAs and the majority of the revenue business comes from the bigger cities.  We have still seen, for instance, in Denver, we conducted focus groups out there recently. And the word there was that a number of major shops had left the brokerage association there and it stop subscribing to the competing company you are talking about. And then I heard in San Diego a number of major shops and stops subscribing there as well. So, we are actually doing extremely well against that competitor, and I think, as long as they are launching the cities that have less than 200,000 population, it is a complete non factor. 
Brian Radecki: And I believe we have more revenue in one of those markets than they have across the entire country, and [indiscernible] the day our business built on 200,000 MSA markets. 
Andy Florance: Okay. Great. Anything else, John? 
John Neff - William Blair: Nope, that was it. Thank you very much.  
Andy Florance:  Thanks, guys. With that we will wind up and thank you for joining us for this fourth quarter year end conference call and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. 
Operator:  Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Presentation :
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to CoStar Group's third quarter 2008 conference call. Today, we have CoStar Group's Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Florance; Chief Financial Officer, Brian Radecki; and Communications Director, Tim Trainor. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Trainor. Please go ahead.
Tim Trainor:  Thank you, Louise [ph]. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to CoStar Group's third quarter 2008 conference call. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Andrew Florance, let me state for the record that certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to those stated in CoStar's third quarter 2008 press release and in CoStar's filings with the SEC, including CoStar's Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007 and CoStar's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 under the heading “Risk Factors.” All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements. You can find a webcast of this conference call on our Web site at www.costar.com/corporate/investor. Thank you for joining us. I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Florance:  Thank you, Tim. Welcome everyone, to CoStar Group's Third Quarter 2008 Conference Call. If there is a theme to our earnings call today, it's earnings. We have managed our business quite conservatively over the past year or so, trimming costs where we could, diversifying our product mix with the launch of CoStar Showcase, and above all, focusing on earnings growth. Our earnings results in the third quarter clearly demonstrate the strength of CoStar Group's business model. In an ailing economy, many companies are unfortunately reporting weak earnings. In sharp contrast, CoStar Group is today reporting triple digit year-over-year quarterly net income growth. In fact, for the fourth consecutive earnings call, we are pleased to again announce that we have doubled our earnings year-over-year. Net income for the third quarter of 2008 increased 104% to $6.6 million from $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2007. At $6.6 million, net income for the third quarter increased 22% from the second quarter net income of $5.4 million. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were $0.34, up from $0.17 in the same period a year ago. CoStar's EBITDA growth has been equally impressive. Our EBITDA for the third quarter was $15.5 million, a 95% increase compared to EBITDA of $8 million in the third quarter of 2007 and a 21% increase compared to EBITDA of $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2008. For the nine months period ending September 30, 2008, over the nine months period ending September 30, 2007, our net income has nearly tripled. We believe that these results clearly demonstrate the absolute resilience of CoStar's business model in a very difficult recessionary environment. This strong earnings performance is consistent with the aggressive target we set in the second quarter 2007 to raise our then company wide 9% EBITDA earnings margin to a 30% U.S. EBITDA margin by the fourth quarter of 2008. Some investors were concerned that the financial meltdown would make our 30% target unattainable, but we are pleased to announce that with our current 33% U.S. EBITDA margin, we have met and exceeded the target we set with you an entire quarter ahead of plan. Of course, we expect to continue to remain above a 30% EBITDA margin in our U.S. operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009 and 2010. In addition, we are reiterating our expectation of swinging from a loss to break even in our international operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. As we expect our international operations to move to break even next quarter, we can consolidate, simplify, and strengthen our EBITDA margin goals and state our expectation that we will reach or exceed an overall 30% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2008. So, rather than just reach a 30% U.S. EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, we are raising the bar and setting the expectation that we can reach a company wide EBITDA margin of 30% in the fourth quarter. This is a very significant milestone for CoStar Group. For many of you who have seen the closing slide from our road show, any time over the past ten years, you know that we've had a long stated target margin of 30% EBITDA companywide. This is another testament to the resilience and strength of the CoStar business model that we expect to reach this longstanding target margin in the fourth quarter despite this negative business environment. Once we obtain a 30% overall EBITDA margin companywide, we expect to remain at or above that target for 2009 and 2010. Furthermore, based upon the visibility we have at this point, we are raising our expected net income target for the fourth quarter and full year 2008. Brian Radecki will give you more color on this later in the call. Having already established our research infrastructure, our operating costs are relatively fixed and we expect they will remain so. This puts us in a very favorable position going forward as the majority of every additional dollar or pound of revenue we earn essentially falls straight to our bottom line. Because of our continued success in reaching our earnings goals, and despite the abysmal economic environment, we remain committed to our previously stated goal of reaching $100 million in annualized EBITDA companywide by the end of 2010. One of CoStar Group's greatest strengths remains our very solid balance sheet. Our cash position increased by $15 million in the third quarter and now stands – and the total cash now, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, now stands at $213 million. The majority of these assets are invested in U.S. Treasuries. CoStar's cash position when viewed together with our shares outstanding, currently translates to $11 per share in cash. And we expect to continue to generate very significant cash flow through the remainder of this year and through 2009. In addition, the company has no long-term debt which I'm sure you'll agree is a very good position to be in right now. I know it certainly helps management sleep well. At any rate, CoStar remains in a very strong financial position. As you well know, a great deal of change since the last time I addressed you. As a result of these changes, as they dramatically alter the global financial landscape this past quarter, together with the ongoing turmoil in the capital markets and the toll all this is expected to take on the general economy, it's clear that the business environment has fundamentally changed and that companies of all sizes in every industry will be grappling with the extent and severity of this crisis for some time. Obviously, commercial real estate is not immune to the economic mayhem of 2008. The commercial real estate industry has enjoyed several consecutive years of strong, positive net absorption, high occupancies, increased rents, and record sales volume in asset valuations. It had remained fairly resilient in the face of the rapid deterioration in property values within the residential real estate sector. First, nationwide and global negative change in the commercial real estate market has been a dramatic 50% plus reduction in property sales that we've observed. I believe that the initial shock from the series of major bank failures and financial stop gap measures will almost certainly put additional stress on the commercial real estate sector. The resulting slower economic growth, combined with tighter access to debt to capital could curtail an already diminished level of commercial real estate transaction activity, likely resulting in weaker negative absorption, climbing vacancy rates, and overall decreases in rental rates and sales prices. Based upon our analysis of the performance of a core set of U.S. markets, average office rental rates only saw a slight drop of 0.3% during the third quarter. Meanwhile, the national average office vacancy rate continued to edge up in the third quarter to 11.8% from 11% in the third quarter of 2007. And it continues to rise. We did not see a dramatic spike in the vacancy this past quarter. Overall, national office vacancy did reach the highest rate it has been in three years, but it's lower than it was in 2002 through the period of 2005. The national average vacancy rate for retail industrial buildings also increased during the quarter, although the levels remained within the range considered healthy under most interpretations. I expect we will see changes in market conditions over the next few quarters as the full extent of the impact of the financial crisis becomes clear. Having observed the ebb and flow of commercial real estate conditions for more than 20 years, this downturn is different and that the source is primarily financial in nature. For the most part, the industry seems to have demonstrated a disciplined approach to new development, largely avoiding the wholesale overbuilding that exacerbated the effects of previous downturns in our economy. As a result, I believe the current balance between supply and demand is not nearly as out of balance as in previous market recessions. Obviously, the market dynamic is now changed and we'll be following market conditions closely in the coming weeks and months to gauge its impact. Regardless, while demand for our information and marketing services clearly is affected by the commercial real estate economics, it is not nearly as cyclical as the commercial real estate industry is overall. While leasing and property sales may go down, demand for information never does. Right now, every lender and institutional investor with commercial real estate exposure as well as every owner of commercial property and the brokers who represent them are grappling with the same fundamental questions. What is this property really worth? What is the best strategy to preserve or enhance its value in the current economy? And where are the market conditions heading and how should their businesses change to adapt to the new realities in this market? The information through CoStar – available through CoStar plays a crucial role in helping our customers answer those questions and in marketing their properties for lease and for sale. Information is integral to facilitate real estate transactions and therefore integral to the real estate service providers day-to-day business. Only by gaining a fuller understanding of each asset at individual property level can lenders, investors, property owners and their representatives properly evaluate opportunities and minimize risk. That's why we believe that this access to our research verified information on specific buildings or properties in any given US market – something that only CoStar offers becomes even more valuable in a weakening economy when market values are in flux. There is no question about it. Brokerage firms are looking for ways to reduce discretionary spending right now. Of course they are. Outsourcing the labor intensive task of conducting basic real estate research to CoStar Group is in fact a tremendous cost savings for our subscribers as opposed to hiring additional staff and redirecting resources to gather, confirm, and maintain information on a continuous basis. Finally, CoStar's customer base is extremely diverse. Our largest client accounts for approximately 3% of our total revenues. When you move to our second and third client, that percentage rate drops dramatically. Even if a major customer happens to go out of business or is acquired by another firm, our experience has shown that CoStar Group can pick up most of the lost revenue from other firms and even startup operations as the thousands of former employees who were CoStar users move to other companies. Because our products help our customers cut costs and drive new revenues, we believe there will be continued strong demand for our services despite the slowing market. We had a strong increase in subscribers during the quarter. The company added 592 net new paying subscribers in the third quarter of 2008. CoStar now has a total of 92,199 paying subscribers which is an increase of 5,144 subscribers or 45.9% from the 87,055 subscribers that we had in the third quarter of 2007. The company executed agreements with 587 new subscribing firms during the third quarter in the United States. Total new subscription sales during the third quarter remained relatively strong at 90% of the new subscription sales level of the same quarter a year ago. Quarter-over-quarter, total new subscription sales remained flat. Annualized total new subscription sales per U.S. sales rep increased to 21,000 per month in the third quarter of 2008, an increase of 6% from the third quarter of 2007 when annualized total new subscription sales per rep was approximately 19,800 per month. Annualized total new subscription sales per U.S. sales rep per month increased 2% for the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the second quarter. The fact that we're seeing continued demand for information services in a down market, I believe, attests the value of our service even when conditions in commercial real estate markets are negative. Unfortunately, like most companies, we have seen an overall adverse impact on our net sales this past quarter. The bleak economic news certainly worked against us and dampened our net quarterly revenue growth. Quarter-over-quarter net sequential revenue growth fell to 0.5%. U.S. subscription contract bookings fell to 2.3 million for the quarter and the average new contract value decreased 7% quarter-over-quarter from 7,155 to 6,642. Net sales growth has been adversely impacted by cancellations or reductions from struggling investment banks, lenders, or institutions similar to the ones we've all been reading negative news about lately. The rapid decline in the relative value of the pound and euro to the dollar has reduced our dollar reporting of international sales. And finally, we have seen higher than normal levels of business failures and lower renewal rates amongst our newest clients. As you may expect, we saw a higher number of contract cancellations for the quarter among lenders and institutional investors. The cancellations in this area accounted for slightly more than $1 million in contract value during the quarter. Firms that have or are likely to reduce or cancel their CoStar agreements include Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Countrywide, Merrill Lynch, LaSalle Bank, Genwest Financial, Equity Office, Washington Mutual, AIG, Wachovia, Cohen Financial, Vertical Capital, and GreenPoint Mortgage. Looking at these cancellations, it's very clear why they're no longer subscribing or have reduced their subscriptions. Some like LaSalle Bank and Countrywide, were acquired by others and many others were involved in mortgage lending or mortgage-backed securities. For example, if you look at Vertical Capital's Web site, it explains they were founded in 2002 and are a leading investment manager in asset-backed securities and related credit markets. The ABS market sectors that the firm focuses on include residential mortgage-backed securities, CEOs, CLOs, and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other forms of securitized debt. If you go to GreenPoint Mortgage's Web site, its homepage states, "Please note that effective October 5, GreenPoint Mortgage has ceased accepting new commercial loan applications." Fortunately, we have more than 16,000 other subscribing firms that are still strong clients, 92% of which are not lenders and 90% of whom are not institutional investors. Although we did get dinged this past quarter by cancellations from financial firms, we believe that the government's efforts to shore up the global financial system including its passage of the $700 billion rescue plan will slow and eventually reverse the losses we've seen among this segment of our client base. At the same time, many healthy firms in the financial services sector are signing major new contracts for our information services. These healthy firms need our unique products to reasonably manage and report on risk and evaluate new investments. This situation appears to be quite different from the previous economic downturn when the tech bubble burst and we saw most of the telecom sector simply disappear and never really come back. Some of the firms in the financial sector that signed new CoStar subscription agreements during the quarter include Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, Bank of America, RVI, American Insurance Company, Intercontinental Real Estate Corporation, Urdang Capital Management, Forest Realty Funding, Long Acre Fund Management, Trenwith Group, and most interestingly, the U.S. Federal Reserve. In the history of financial firms failing or cutting back we have discovered another area in which we see elevated cancellation rates. In a downturn where most companies are looking to reduce costs, the newest clients who have not yet fully integrated the value of our services into their organizations are more likely to cancel. We now have a sharply bifurcated renewal rate. Firms have been clients for more than three years appear to have a renewal rate of approximately 95% while those who have been clients for less than three years have a renewal rate of approximately 70%. Fortunately, most of our clients have been with us for more than three years. While this issue surprised us somewhat, we believe there is a relatively straightforward fix. We changed our commission program approximately eight months ago to make a significant portion of our account executives incentives payable not on contract signing, but upon successfully getting most of the users at new customer site using our service regularly. This has been working well and we believe that this is embedding our products into our clients operations at a much faster pace and should show a significant benefit when the first contracts of the program roll in four months time. We are taking a number of additional steps which we believe should increase our renewal rate in the new client segment in our overall renewal rate. Unfortunately, in a down market, some unscrupulous firms in commercial real estate try to reduce costs by stealing CoStar's services rather than paying for them. CoStar Group continued to make substantial progress this past quarter in our ongoing efforts to protect our intellectual property and legitimate subscribers from those who seek to fraudulently gain access to our information or otherwise use our images or information illegally. As previously reported, we've established an internal anti-piracy group that uses extensive fraud detection technology to continually monitor CoStar's online information products and detect and prevent unauthorized access. Year-to-date, CoStar's anti-piracy team has brought in approximately $700,000 in out of court settlements with firms engaged in password sharing. And they have signed new agreements, properly licensing previously unauthorized users to an aggregate value of over $600,000 in annualized revenue. CoStar will continue to prosecute individuals and firms engaged in this unlawful activity. CoStar Showcase is the innovative new marketing service we launched in May that we believe provides the most effective platform available to the commercial real estate professionals to market their listings to the tens of thousands of business professionals who are searching the internet for commercial real estate each day. At the end of September, 4.5 months after the product launch, 748 client sites had committed to $2.2 million in annual CoStar Showcase contracts. These 748 clients are paying for approximately 2,300 brokers to market their listings on Showcase. This means that within 4.5 months of launch, we believe the broker share using CoStar Showcase is roughly equal to 10% of the broker share our leading competitor took more than a decade to sign. Most of these 748 firms subscribing to Showcase tried the product free of charge for several months before committing to pay for the services under a one-year or more contract. We think this is the strongest indication that this is a superior product. Indeed, many brokers who now subscribe to Showcase have told us that it is proving itself to be an effective tool for generating quality leads, property tours, and deals. William Montrose, the principal of AMR Commercial in Bethesda, Maryland said his company's CoStar Showcase subscription paid for itself in a matter of days after generating a lead that turned into a deal for a seemingly unleasable basement suite. Joe Alberts with Lincoln Property Company in Chicago credit the huge internet exposure their properties have on CoStar Showcase for helping them reach perspective tenants interested in small and medium size office space for lease and they received numerous leads that resulted in property tours. Jim Menton with Remax Commercial Brokerage in Manhattan Beach, California said his firm recently sold a high profile retail parcel in Southern California through a lead generated by CoStar. Put simply, CoStar Showcase works, he said. We believe this demonstration of acceptance over the first 4.5 months following the product launch is a testament to its overall effectiveness and shows that the service provides a superior alternative to other solutions available. Specifically, CoStar Showcase offers much higher quality content than competitive Web sites because CoStar does the work to collect the content on behalf of subscribers. As a direct result of our proactive research process, CoStar has the most extensive photo library and commercial property information database in the U.S. Unlike many other Web sites, CoStar does not bombard and scare off potential leads with endless pop-ups and registration requirements. We believe that both property marketers and searchers favor this frictionless environment. We've seen consistent month over month increases in the number of unique visitors to CoStar.com following the product launch, which we believe will ultimately yield stronger results for Showcase subscribers through more property views and leads generated. Our search engine optimization efforts have been very successful this year and we are now able to drive more traffic to our Web site for only 60% of the cost compared to July of this year. To see a prime example of this yourself, next time you're in Google, type in the keywords "Commercial Real Estate". These are the most popular key words in this industry. You'll see that CoStar now not only has the number one slot in the sponsor results area, but also one of the top slots in the free organic search results. That means CoStar now has some of the best retail space on the internet. Last year, CoStar didn't even appear organically in the first couple of page results. Quickly achieving these top positions in sponsored and organic searches are translating into increasingly large visitor audiences. Indeed, CoStar's Web site audience measurement service, Omniture, confirmed that CoStar.com has seen month over month increases in unique visitors this past quarter totaling more than 1.1 million. Omniture is the premier Web site audience measurement system available and we believe provides the most accurate data on our Web site audience. Our main competitor in this marketing space made claims recently that they have the most highly trafficked Web site in the industry. Yet to get these comparative audience metrics, they rely on the consumer based panel ComScore, a system that tends to favor Web sites with heavy consumer traffic due to the consumer focus composition of their panel. As a result of this consumer skewed composition panels such as ComScore will under represent Web sites that cater to a business audience such as CoStar.com. Being that our marketing efforts are geared towards driving a qualified business audience to our subscribers listings, we feel strongly that these ComScore numbers are mostly irrelevant for a site like CoStar.com and unique service like Showcase. For all these reasons, we believe CoStar Showcase has the potential to be a significant success. Essentially, this new service expands our company's focus more directly than ever into the marketing side of the commercial real estate business. For years now, our clients have thought of CoStar as being their research partner. Now with Showcase, we've taken a major step, positioning CoStar as their marketing partner as well. And the timing couldn't have been any better. We believe that Showcase is a product that is countercyclical and that it helps brokers to generate leads inexpensively and do so at a lower cost than other marketing alternatives. This is exactly the remedy brokers are looking for in a down market. Showcase is also a very efficient and high margin product for us because it leverages our existing research operations and requires very little additional support or investment other than software development, marketing, and pay-per-click budget. Turning to the research side of our business, our research operations are performing very well. Our research team provides the core data that is the source of our value and identity as a company. They continue to do an outstanding job in researching all the markets we cover and demonstrate their value by aggregating listings and confirming their accuracy in an extremely efficient and timely manner. The total number of listings available through our service continues to grow, total research and verified commercial real estate listings in the CoStar's U.S. database grew 25% year-over-year from approximately 798,000 in the third quarter 2007 to approximately 996,000 in the third quarter 2008. In total, between both our U.S. and international operations, the company currently has 1.1 million listings in our database and the total gross building area (inaudible) maintained by CoStar is now approximately 63 billion square feet in the U.S. Finally, I want to update you on the all cash offer of $8.75 per share that CoStar previously made to acquire Reis Inc., the New York based commercial real estate information provider. As you may recall, when CoStar reiterated that offer on August 12th, the 13th, roughly, of 2008, Reis's stock had previously closed at $4.40 per share or so. At nearly 100% premium to Reis's share price at the time, we believed our offer of $8.75 per share was both compelling and attractive. Frankly, we were shocked that Reis would reject our offer so hastily and refuse to engage what we felt were meaningful discussions about a possible business combination. The CEO of Reis never returned my phone calls. Attorneys for Reis insisted that CoStar enter into a multi-year non-negotiable standstill agreement and secrecy agreement before any discussions occurred. We believe that this agreement was overly restrictive and unreasonable and we did not sign it. One of the feelings – one of the reasons we felt it was unreasonable was the fact in 2005, when Reis solicited acquisition offers before going public, CoStar offered in writing to acquire Reis for $80 million or better. We believe we never received any real consideration for our valid offer. CoStar was not invited by Reis to participate in those negotiations alongside of other bidders and we were surprised that our 2005 offer was never even mentioned in Reis's disclosure documents detailing the decision by Reis and its CEO to take the company public by merging the privately held Reis Commercial Real Estate Services business with his brother's publicly traded land development firm. In August of 2008, we could not anticipate the unprecedented drop in the major stock indices in our own stock. Since August 2008, the NASDAQ index has fallen 32%, CBRE has fallen 59% and CoStar Group has fallen 45%. If Reis had fallen from $4.44 per share in line with the average of these numbers, they'd be trading somewhere roughly at $2.40. If Reis was trading in line at $2.40 per share, our $8.75 offer would be a ridiculous 260% premium. Given the drop in our share price, we feel that the offer would no longer be accretive or make any sense whatsoever. As it turns out, Lloyd may have done us a favor. While we continue to believe the combination with Reis could offer meaningful benefits for both firms shareholders, given the dramatic change in the economic environment, there is no way CoStar would now consider an acquisition at $8.75 per share. Accordingly, we are now formally and completely withdrawing our previous offer. Instead of pursuing an acquisition, we are now moving on and focusing on further developing our own competitive service in what we believe will be – which we believe will have a very strong advantage, given CoStar's superior data and market coverage. Before turning the call over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer and giving my voice a little bit of a rest, let me reiterate that the company expects to continue to generate consistent earnings growth as we move through 2008, through 2009 and 2010. We are very focused on our goal of doubling our EBITDA to achieve $100 million in annualized EBITDA run rate for the company by the end of 2010 and we expect to continue to strengthen our already strong balance sheet throughout this year, through 2009 and 2010. Brian?
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, Andy. Don't worry, everybody. I'm going to work with Andy more next quarter to get his script under 100 pages. But we'll give Andy a little bit of a break here. During Q3, CoStar posted another strong quarter of earnings growth, margin expansion, and cash generation. As Andy mentioned earlier and stated in our press release, net income increased 104% in the third quarter of 2008 over the same period one year ago to $6.6 million or $0.34 per diluted share compared to $3.3 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2007. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2008 was $15.5 million, an increase of 95% compared to EBITDA of $8 million for the third quarter of 2007. The third quarter 2008 annualized EBITDA is now $62 million as it continues to climb each quarter. Now I'm going to mostly focus on sequential results for the third quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2008. Total revenues grew sequentially from $53.5 million in Q2 to $53.8 million in Q3 of 2008. Our revenue growth in the third quarter was clearly moderated by global economic turbulence. In particular, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, a decline in non-subscription based revenue and slower revenue growth from subscription based services all contributed to the slower third quarter revenue growth. We do not expect non-subscription based revenue, which is ad hoc revenue, which is mostly related to products facilitating the buying and selling of commercial buildings, to improve for several quarters given the market conditions. But, as you probably know, unlike other competitors in the space, non-subscription based revenue for CoStar accounts for less than 5% of the total revenues for the company. More exact, subscription revenues accounted for 95.5% of total revenues in the third quarter. Our 12-month trailing customer renewal rate remains strong at 89.8% or as we stated in the press release, approximately 90%. This subscription revenue is accounting for most of our total revenue and the majority of our subscribers on annual agreements, we consider our 12-month trailing customer renewal rate to be a good indicator of the strength of our business model. In addition, for the third quarter, our customer renewal rates for subscription based services remains solid at 88%. All in all, we believe these are still very healthy numbers based on where we are today in the economy and clearly heads and tails better than most other public companies that I'm aware of. International operations contributed 11% of total revenues and international subscription revenues accounted for approximately 91% of this revenue during Q3. Year-over-year, international revenues modestly decreased in U.S. dollars 1.8% mainly due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates while our international subscription revenues increased in British pounds, 5.6% year-over-year. Including the impact of unfavorable exchange rates, international revenues decreased approximately $300,000 from $6 million to $5.7 million in Q3 of 2008. As Andy stated earlier after announcing our Q2 2007 goal of 30% EBITDA margin in the U.S. by the end of this year, we have exceeded that goal by 10% three months ahead of schedule. Now, we are focused on working towards achieving the goal we set out last quarter $100 million in annualized EBITDA run rate companywide by the end of 2010. We believe this goal is achievable based on our strong subscription based business model with a relatively fixed or slightly declining cost structure. We also believe this goal is still achievable in the current economic and commercial real estate environments. Furthermore, we continue to expect that we will be adding new subscribers, renewing current subscribers, and growing our earnings throughout this environment. We believe our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to manage our cost structure carefully during these difficult times. Now, let me discuss gross margin which increased by $1 million from $35.1 million in Q2 of '08 to $36.1 million in Q3 of 2008, an approximately $300,000 increase in revenues and an approximately $700,000 decrease in cost of revenues. About half the decrease in cost of revenues directly relate to permanent operational and efficiency gains that we've obtained by eliminating or reducing redundant costs. The remainder of the decrease in cost of revenues relates to variable timing differences for new hires, headcount and other related costs. Overall, gross margin percentage expanded to 67.2% in Q3 from 65.7% in Q2 of 2008. This increase in both gross margin dollars and percentage demonstrates the strength of our core business model. Now that we have completed the previous step ups in cost structure, we continue to expect the majority of the revenue to drop directly to the gross margin line, just as we have seen for many, many quarters in a row. Overall, operating expenses decreased $1.7 million during the quarter from $26.6 million in Q2 to $24.9 million in Q3 of 2008. The decrease principally resulted from a decline in marketing expenditures in the quarter which are seasonally higher in the second quarter. To remind everybody, in Q2, CoStar participated in the ICSC Trade Show and we had additional marketing costs associated with the launch of CoStar Showcase which Andy talked about in detail. G&A expenses remained flat from Q3 – from Q2. One thing to note, legal expenses for the third quarter were approximately $1.1 million, slightly higher than last quarter, as we expected. We consider these legal costs like nearly all public companies to be normal recurring costs which we anticipate will continue for the foreseeable future. As you are aware, we are currently involved in multiple lawsuits and could be involved in a few more which we have factored into our earnings guidance. As always, we follow GAAP-based accounting and report all of our legal expenses in our income statement EBITDA number and in our earnings outlook for the year. Throughout the remainder of 2008, we expect the company's overall operating expenses to remain relatively fixed or to decline slightly. EBITDA for the third quarter was $15.5 million, an increase of $2.7 million compared to EBITDA of $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2008. Reconciliation of EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to GAAP based results is shown in detail in our press release issued yesterday. The press release is also available on our Web site, www.CoStar.com. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $213.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, an increase of $14.9 million since June 30th 2008 and as Andy mentioned, we have no long-term debt. Our third quarter capital expenditures were approximately $800,000. Now I'll conclude my remarks with our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008 and the year. As always, our guidance takes into account recent growth rates and our results may be impacted by the uncertainties around exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in the economic conditions. We have attempted to reflect economic weakness in our guidance, but recognize that we are in a period of flux and cannot predict the direction of the various market factors. The key strength of our subscription-based business model is that it provides good earnings visibility. We expect to grow our earnings from U.S. operations through this year by leveraging the relatively fixed cost structure and managing it lower when necessary. Moreover, we believe there are significant opportunity for additional high margin revenue growth following the investments we've made in the past several years to expand our coverage in the U.S. and U.K. and with additional services like CoStar Showcase. Based on the strong results from the past three quarters and continued execution of our plan, we are raising the outlook for fully diluted net income per share for 2008 to approximately $1.22 to $1.24 per share. In addition, we now expect fully diluted net income per share for the fourth quarter 2008 of approximately $0.34 to $0.36. Let me remind everybody, our updated annual earnings guidance is 20% higher than we forecasted just eight months ago. All this while operating and I quote "in the worst economic environment seen since the great depression" as my 96-year-old grandmother would say. This is clearly the 100-year flood a few years early. As indicated in our press release, we expect fourth quarter revenue in the range of $53.8 million to $54.3 million. Given the unprecedented current economic environment including significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively effecting international revenue, our actual fourth quarter revenue results may differ from our guidance. For the full year 2008, we expect approximately $5 million to $6 million in pre-tax, non-cash equity compensation charges related to the vesting of stock options and restrictive stock grants. As we continue to invest internationally, the mechanics of our effective tax rate calculation continued to be effected by the amount of income or loss in the UK where we do not get an equivalent tax expense or benefit to offset U.S. corporate tax. This results in an overall blended effective rate which may increase or decrease from our current rate. We anticipate our overall effective rate to be approximately 45% which we've been about for the year for 2008. In conclusion, the entire management team remains focused and fully committed to achieving our new earnings goal of $100 million in annualized EBITDA companywide by the end of 2010. We fully expect to manage our business through the current environment and to capitalize on our stable subscription based business model to achieve this goal. Q3 results demonstrate that we are committed to delivering on our earnings goals. As we have stated many times, we believe we have a strong business model. 95% subscription business, high renewal rates, unique, proactively verified proprietary database, high barriers to entry, market leader, strong balance sheet with no debt, high cash flow type business. I have to say this is a nice business model to be in, especially in the unprecedented economic and commercial real estate environment we are in today. As great as it is, we've always said we're not completely immune to what's going on around us. But as you can see from our earnings results, we are certainly prepared for it. We continue to look forward to reporting our progress to you. And with that, I ask the operator to open the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) And our first question will come from John Neff from William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Neff – William Blair:  Hi, guys. Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter.
Andrew Florance:  Thank you.
John Neff – William Blair:  Couple questions for you. How do we think of the decline in cost structure? Do we think of that as cuts that are necessary to deliver on the margin targets? Or do we think of it as a natural decline following a period of significant investment? Or do we think of it as both?
Andrew Florance:  If you were to – I would characterize the cuts that have occurred so far as being – they would not be characterized as layoffs in response to any environment or a target margin. It's more just basic business management given a bunch of factors like integrating together all these different companies we acquired in the UK into one much more efficient, streamlined company. It is things like backing all the friction out of the process that occurs after we expanded into so many U.S. markets. As soon as you take the foot off the accelerator in adding new markets as we've done here in the last five quarters, historically, every time we do that, our expenses drop off and it's frustrating because I can't get, Brian, when we're actually opening those new markets up and I know that we're ending a period of opening bunch of new markets. Brian will never in advance admit that costs will decline when we stop opening new markets. They always do. But now he has to admit that actually costs do decline after we stop opening up new geography. The company – if the company needed to, we have the ability to additionally reduce our cost structure. But we're running – right now we're making the margin targets we're looking for ahead of schedule and we will have room to continue to make those margin targets and enhance them. So we're taking advantage of the fact that we've got a strong balance sheet. The marketplace is very volatile. It's a little more challenging. But we feel we're comfortable where we are.
Brian Radecki:  John, just to add a little color to that. As we completed the step up in cost structure in Q2, right around when I was made CFO, we reduced total costs 10% – 11% somewhere in that range or so. And I think as Andy said, we haven't had to make any major adjustments to that or sudden cost cuts or anything that wouldn't allow us to continue to run the business for long-term growth. We're still releasing new products like Showcase, delivering higher quality information. You see some of the efficiencies that we've gotten were from software releases, were from consolidating office space, getting paid $7.6 million for new space in the UK, reducing, consolidating space here in Bethesda and saving $1.2 million. So we're able to continue to go through that and while those types of cost savings and efficiencies, you can't really budget and forecast because you have to go out and find them. I would expect that we could continue over the next few years to see something in that same range, similar spread out as we just continue to go through and look for more efficiencies, better ways to do things. As you know, if you gain just a few percentage points of efficiency gains on approximately 900 researchers, there is some significant cost savings. When you're not hiring and training people in bulk the way we were for a few years, there is a lot of cost savings on training, travel costs of bringing people here to Bethesda and those types of things so.
Andrew Florance:  And our turnover rate in research say in our San Diego operations is now probably half of the level it was just a couple years ago. Sales force turnover is actually fairly low. So that all basically saves you a lot of money.
Brian Radecki:  Does that answer your question, John?
John Neff – William Blair:  Yes. That's helpful.
Brian Radecki:  I'll be disappointed if you don't have a follow-up question.
John Neff – William Blair:  Yes. I got a few for you. Just thinking about what sort of minimum sort of sequential growth is required to kind of continue to unlock the operating leverage, is there a minimal growth rate below which you can't make progress towards – positive progress towards that $100 million annualized EBITDA goal?
Andrew Florance:  I think that the last four months, five months or so have been very unusual. I never would have predicted that Wachovia, AIG, Countrywide, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, WaMu, Lehman Brothers, et cetera, et cetera would occur. I think that the bail out package has probably stabilized that area. And hopefully, the VIC settles down a little bit here and creates a more favorable operating environment. But I think that in this pretty bad environment, we've been able to keep things positive. The exchange rate, obviously, is a problem as it goes the wrong way. It's great for when you're traveling on business to London. It's not good for reporting earnings in US dollars. But as long as we're flat, we'll continue to show earnings leverage.
Brian Radecki:  And John, to follow-up on that, couple points. We talked about the subscription based business in the U.S. being at 1.2% or something like that. I would expect to continue to see that to be some place in that range now. I think, again, I can't predict what's going to happen to exchange rates in Q4. I look at the exchange rates. I got back from a once in a life time trip, taking my entire family to Italy. I know I talked about this with some investors, which I saved up for and spent a lot of money on. Literally, within a day or so after I got back at the end of July, the exchange rate dropped from about two x to about 1.75 on September 11th in one month. But then it popped back up within a week to 1.86 and now, over the past month, it dropped to where the same place it was when we acquired our focus operations nearly six years ago. So just in less than a couple months, we've had some severe volatility up and down with exchange rates wiping out what we've seen as a pretty steady increasing gain of six years going up and down. So, pretty hard to forecast. But I would think that over the next few quarters, those things will settle down, you'll be back into some more normalized ranges.
John Neff – William Blair:  Okay. Another revenue question for you. Just trying to get a sense of how the slow down is sort of manifesting across different sort of vintages in markets. In other words, is there a – are you seeing converging growth rates between old and new markets or are old markets slowing more rapidly than the new. Just trying to get a sense of how homogenous or unhomogeneous?
Andrew Florance:  I think the thing, it's not so much about the market. It's more about the age of the customer – I mean the age of the customer relationship. So, again, it goes back to this thing where if I just subscribe to CoStar Group for the – some of the customers who – there's a higher likelihood that if someone just subscribed to CoStar Group in January of this year and yet deeply integrated their operations, they're more likely to cancel than someone who's been a customer for more than three years. So it's more about the customer, not about the markets. The markets are acting fairly similar and this is a good problem because this is addressable and we've put four or five things in place that we think will actually have a big impact and should, outside of thing, unusual things like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, should enable us to get the renewal rates back up as those changes take effect. So the markets are acting fairly similarly. It's more about new customers versus middle aged or older customers.
John Neff – William Blair:  Helpful. And last question and I can get back in queue. Reaction to Xceligent's announcement today of recapturing the Magnificent Seven in Milwaukee and they're taking, as they say in the press release, responsibility for updating their market research databases? Is there sort of a renewed threat out of Xceligent?
Andrew Florance:  We've gotten to the place where we're digging for news and we're talking about someone winning a $10,000 contract. So over the course of a number of years, Xceligent and CoStar competed in a number of secondary markets. Things ebb and flow. I don't think anyone would say that Xceligent has a product that's equal to or even close to as high quality as a product as CoStar Group. I know that I've heard that Xceligent has dropped their prices dramatically, which given the fact that my impression has been that their revenue growth has been flat or declining for quite some time and that there, my impression is that they don't make money. I would not want to be – I would much rather be in CoStar's seat going into this particular market environment where CoStar Group's got a strong balance sheet, is profitable, strong, and a top-notch product. Because ultimately, cutting your costs when you're not making money to try to win business is probably not a survival tactic in an environment like this. So, I think this actually is probably good news because in a down market like this, sometimes you get some consolidation or you get market share gain. And it would not be the right thing to do to slash your price dramatically to try to win business right now. Does that answer your question?
John Neff – William Blair:  Yes, it does. Thank you so much.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Maietta from Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Thank you.
Andrew Florance:  Hi, Jon.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Hi, Andy. How are you? Hi, Brian.
Andrew Florance:  I'm suffering from having two toddlers at home, bring them home from preschool.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Andy, there are certain products within the portfolio that may lend themselves particularly well for this environment. I know you have an analytics product. I'm just wondering if you could speak to that?
Andrew Florance:  Sure. So obviously, we had a shock to the system with all the activity from the summer with the big financials, but we're gearing up both in the United Kingdom and the United States. We're making it top priority to gear up our analytic products, because we think there's going to be a lot of demand in that area. So, for years, folks have used our products to originate mortgages or to produce the prerequisite half an inch of market data at the back of any sort of loan commitment documents for an asset. I think very few people have actually read what was in those market reports that CoStar produces at the back of those loan commitment, investment commitment documents. So these market conditions, based on what we saw back in the '90s when things turned south on the asset side, people become a lot more interested in what's actually happening in the market conditions comparable sales cap rates, supply-demand, how new construction might impact leasing, what competitors are doing with rental rates. So we're going to release a whole series of upgrades to our analytic products that will not cost a lot of money because basically using the development and resources we currently have, the data resources we currently have, but should appeal to a market that's becoming dramatically more risk adverse. And we're basically a unique service that eliminates what's happening in that risk. So we're bullish about it, working hard in that whole analytic zone right now.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Got it. Okay. And then I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the deal with the Federal Reserve? How are they using the products? Maybe what group within the Fed is using the solution?
Andrew Florance:  Under advice of counsel I cannot comment.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Okay. Brian, just a couple of items on the balance sheet statement of cash flow. I may have missed it. Cash from operations in the quarter?
Brian Radecki:  I think for the nine months ended it's about – cash from operations is about $30 million.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Okay. And stock comp in the quarter, if you have that?
Brian Radecki:  Stock comp in the quarter was about – I think it was like $1.2 million, $1.3 million. Something like that.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Okay. Got it. And then just last question. On the OpEx line, are there certain operating expenses where you have more leverage than others? Or is it just kind of – should we think about it more as the fixed – as you said, kind of all lines being fixed with maybe a slight bend to reducing over time?
Brian Radecki:  Yes. I think obviously we talk a little bit about – there was a big decrease in selling and marketing, but I think that was clearly stated. Everybody knew about ICSC and the release of Showcase. I think kind of where you're at right now is a pretty good cost base and obviously we'll give guidance as to if something's happening in one of those lines. But I think right now, you're on a pretty good point trajectory for each of those.
Jon Maietta – Needham and Company:  Okay. Thanks a lot.
Andrew Florance:  Great. Thanks, Jon.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, Jon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Brian Radecki:  Good morning, Brett.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter.
Andrew Florance:  Thank you, sir.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  Just a couple quick questions. I wanted to make sure that – you talked a little bit about behavior of existing clients.
Brian Radecki:  Yes.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  I wondered how are those conversations going? You guys are a big cost for those guys that obviously you're still, as you say, at some level you're a cost reduction or a way to save for them. But at the same time, as you say, they're obviously looking for ways to sort of clamp down. When you have those discussions, how do those usually go? I know at that level you're as much a partnership as anything. So I'm just curious.
Andrew Florance:  There is – it's probably can be described, you have to segment it out to multiple, different discussions. Unfortunately, for the one man shop that just set out last year to go into business and their timing was pretty poor, the conversation is sort of one way. They basically default. For the company that is a midsize firm that's had dramatically bad impact (inaudible) fortune like say, they're based in Southern California or Southern Florida. They may have cut their staff in half. And we'll work with those folks and try to be reasonable to help them through the market knowing that we'd like to have a long-term relationship with them as they recovered. That is probably not the predominant kind of conversation that's occurring. At the mid and upper level client, things are actually very solid. We hear little to no dialogue where people are questioning us to reduce our prices. No one's talking about that with us in the mid to upper level customer. Just because they may engage in conversation, but we're like one-tenth of 1% of their cost structure. And in fact, without disclosing names, there's a really good side to this whole situation which is some of the bigger companies, the bigger, stronger companies who have been either maintaining internal research operations that are duplicative with CoStar Group or maintaining expensive internal research operations instead of CoStar Group. Some of those companies are now actually eliminating those internal research operations and buying more from CoStar Group. So one of our biggest customers who is taking significant steps to reduce their internal cost structure is at the same time increasing the amount of products and services they're buying from us. So we are a cost saving product at the end of the day for most firms and market conditions like this create an environment where people seek those cost saving products like CoStar Group. So this whole bifurcation we've seen recently in our renewal rate, I'm amazed. When you look at customers in this environment who have been customers for more than three years, the fact their renewal rate is 95% is really amazing to me. That's in a context of folks like AIG disappearing for us or Bear Stearns disappearing for us. So the conversations sort of range the spectrum. I hope that answers your question.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  Yes. That's really helpful.
Brian Radecki:  Big guys aren't saying to cut our costs because they know that we have people that we've got to pay and we've got to do the job for them. They don't want us to cut our costs too far.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  Right. And sort of another question looking into '09. I know you guys aren't giving guidance, but I'm just trying to think about the different components of revenue growth and I know it'll probably be tougher in '09 than in the past. But I think about things like your CPI price increases that usually happen. I think about what Showcase could contribute. I think about cross sales and things like that. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about the components of growth in '09 on the top line?
Andrew Florance:  We think that we can move the ball forward with Showcase and continue to pick up some market shares. We effectively communicate to the customer base the relative advantages of our product through every means. We think that there's continued cross selling activity. We think there will be market share gains from firms who are getting rid of internal research. We think that there will be institutional lending and government agencies who will buy more of our product because they're trying to understand what's going on with these mortgages. We are not going to rely heavily on price increases right now. We think that in the interest of good long-term relationships with our customers, we don't want to hit them with price increases right now. So we're laying low on the price increase side. Basically, CPI increases that sort of stuff. So, assuming things stabilize somewhat over the last several months, it should be a pretty solid year. Do you want to add anything to that, Brian?
Brian Radecki:  No. I think you got it.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  That's helpful. And then just sort of one more as we think about this, the analytic stuff that you guys were talking about, is this kind of expense or incremental expense going to be similar to Showcase in the sense that you're just going to re-task developers? Or is it the kind of thing that would be complex enough that you'll need to hire some specific expertise to get the real value that you think will sell to customers?
Andrew Florance:  We believe we already have most of that expertise in-house. And we believe it will be less expensive than Showcase. So I think it will probably cost a fraction of what Showcase cost, and Showcase cost a fraction of what opening new markets cost. So we think it'll be downright dirt cheap. And the great thing about it is it's not like that kind of product is something that someone else could replicate. We're the only folks around with the largest research operations in the world.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  And one last one on expenses. Brian, you mentioned, I think what you said was, you all have lowered costs by something like 10% over the last year or so and you think you can do that again sort of over time over the next, it sounded like three-ish type years. It sounds like it's not so much staff as it is just efficiencies, sort of here and there, taken bit by bit that add up to a larger whole. Can you just give us an example? You talked a little bit about that. I just want to make sure I understand the kinds of things that you're talking about.
Brian Radecki:  Sure. I think it's a combination of the two. So, as I said, we had more trainers, when you had hundreds of people going through training sessions and you're ramping up headcount, you had more trainers, more recruiters, you were placing more ads in newspapers. For the sales group, you were flying them here for a month of onsite training and then bringing them back for retraining and those types of things. So I think it's a whole combination of maybe there is some less headcount if you don't need as many trainers or recruiters and those types of things. You have savings from lower turnover. I think when you hire in bulk you typically have higher turnover. We've seen lower turnover this year than last year. And I would expect that trend to continue going forward into next year. And then it does have things that have nothing to do with headcount which is like we talked about, the London lease where we had multiple leases out there and when you close something like that, you also gain efficiencies on communication costs and insurance and those types of things. So I think it's a combination of the two and I think it's a thing that we can continue to look for and you'll continue to see efficiencies over the next few years without having any impact at all on the quality of the data or the projects that we're able to put out with new software like Showcase or focusing on analytics.
Andrew Florance:  Brett, Brian's volunteering to take a pay cut for '09.
Brian Radecki:  Right, after Andy.
Brett Huff – Stephens Inc.:  Thanks. I appreciate your time. That's all I had.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, Brett.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wilson from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Brian Radecki:  Good morning, Jim. How are you doing?
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  Doing fine. Could you – I missed a little bit of the call because I have a few calls going on here at once. But could you give a little color? You talked a lot about your biggest clients and the stability and obviously pricing issues, but how many or what percentage of your contracts or some form of color on how much is fixed in dollar pricing structure versus how much actually primarily (inaudible) per seat kind of revenue model for you?
Brian Radecki:  I would say that 99% – I would say 96%, 97% of our subscription revenue is fixed. It's like – it's initially priced at per seat, but during the term of these contracts, it's fixed. On contract renewal, there is some negotiation if they've downsized dramatically. But generally, our price list over the last ten years has been increasing at a pace much greater than the price that the average customer sees in escalations. So the price schedule's climbing much faster than the existing customers' price is climbing each year. As a result, if someone has reduced their staff by 20% at the time the contract rolls, they're still at that 20% reduction receiving a 30% discount off of our list price typically. So it's not a big variable for us. The bigger variable is like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns kind of situation. Not so much headcount reductions.
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  Okay. And have you had any big – these are financial services customers, really the AIG, Bear, or Lehman that might've left. Anything material what thing of any in the actual real estate industry itself or the brokerage industry?
Brian Radecki:  It's more of the real small guys. The big guys, obviously some very big names in the industry that you and I both know we're talking about. They've had some weak earnings or a sharp drop in their stock price. But people forget that over the decades, these businesses don't go anywhere. They go public. They go private. They go public again. They go private again. They still have thousands of brokers that spend hours each day inside of our terminals. So whether or not those brokers are at Company A or Company B, they still use our products. And if their income goes down 30%, they still use our products. And when they're making no money, they still use our products. When they're in bankruptcy, they still use our products. It's been pretty stable inside the brokerages. Folks have been commercial brokers for 25 years of their life and they're in the top 10% of the industry don't stop being brokers because of a downturn. And remember, the brokers often make good money in downturns because they move all the tenants out of the B buildings into the A buildings that are sitting vacant and they move all the tenants out of C buildings into the B buildings that are then standing vacant and they play musical chairs with the industry until the next recovery comes. So we're not seeing anything that makes us nervous inside the brokerage side of things.
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  Okay. And then just finally, I see growth being modest in the quarter, but was it predominantly – I'm assuming that's the answer, predominantly existing customers adding new services? Or was there much in the way of new customer acquisition?
Andrew Florance:  There was a lot of new customer acquisition. 590 some I think. 570 some new firms came on board. So the total sales volume has not changed dramatically over, it's pretty much in line with what we've seen last five years. The only change is a big change in exchange rates, new customer, brand new customers cutting costs, or the meltdown of Wall Street.
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  Okay. All right. That makes sense. Thanks.
Brian Radecki:  Thanks, Jim.

Operator: Welcome everyone to the CoStar Group second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Trainor, you may begin your conference.
Tim Trainor: Good morning, everyone and welcome to CoStar Group's second quarter 2008 conference call. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Andrew Florance, let me state that certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to those stated in CoStar's second quarter 2008 press release and in CoStar's filings with the SEC, including CoStar's form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007 and CoStar’s form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 under the heading "Risk Factors." All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements. You can find a webcast of this conference call at www.costar.com/corporate/investor. Thank you again for joining us. I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Florance: Welcome everyone to CoStar Group’s second quarter 2008 conference call. I'm very pleased to report that CoStar posted another strong performance in the second quarter, one which we added a large number of new subscribing firms continued to added net new individual subscribers and continue to generate very solid earnings growth. In May we launched our newest product offering CoStar showcase, which has surpassed even or most ambitious expectations in terms of market reception. Also during the quarter the total number of commercial property listings marketed through CoStar exceeded 1 million for the first time and continues to grow. We believe that this is by for the most property listing available through a unified database in any website in the industry and represents a monumental achievement for our company. In addition as we announced in our release today we have made substantial progress on the comment we made to investors 12 months ago to pursue, accelerate earnings growth while in the substantial investments we made over the past years to expand our market coverage in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.  Having conclude the transition last year from a period of heavy investment in our business to one in which we generate solid earnings growth we set a goal on the second quarter of 2007 to dramatically increase our then company wide 9% EBITDA margin and achieve a 30% EBTTDA margin within the U.S. by the fourth quarter of 2008. With this quarter’s results showing a 29% U.S. EBITDA margin we have almost reached that goal. As a result we are again raising our earnings outlook to the rest of this year.  Having established a pattern of increasing profitability over the past four quarters, we intend to continue to pursue our current strategy of sequential earnings growth further strengthening the company’s financial position. Based upon our current revenue growth rate together with the demand we see for our core information products and newly launched internet marketing service CoStar showcase, we are setting a new goal for the company of doubling our EBITDA and generating 100 million in annualized EBITDA on a run rate basis by the end of 2010.  Net income for the second quarter increased 363% to $5.4 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to $1.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the second quarter 2008 were $53.5 million compared to $47.8 million to the second quarter of 2007. Core U.S. subscription revenue increased 2.9% in the first quarter to the second quarter of 2008 consistent with increases over the past several quarter. EBITDA, Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization to the second quarter of 2008 was $12.8 million, an increase of 204% compared to EBITDA of $4.2 million from the second quarter of 2007. Demand for our information products remained quite strong in the second quarter. In total we added 587 net new subscribing firms in the United States, the second highest number of new subscribers the company has added in a single quarter. In addition we had approximately 785 net new paying subscribers during the quarter for a total off 91,607 authorized users. CoStar’s customer renewal rate for subscription based services remained high at approximately 90%. By far the most significant event of the past quarter from a sales perspective was the main launch of CoStar showcase. Our innovative new marketing service that makes the listings of CoStar showcase subscribers automatically accessible to the tens of thousands of business professionals who are searching the internet for commercial real estate each day. CoStar Showcase taps the substantial traffic on our websites and additional traffic from major search engines to provide commercial real estate professionals with an exceptional new opportunity for marketing their listings on the internet and generating more leads for their properties. Currently, orders for this new service are approximately 4 million making it one of, if not the most successful new product launch in CoStar’s 20 year history. Since, we launched CoStar Showcase in mid May, 574 subscribing firms have had their listings exposed to internet searches from such leading companies as McDonalds, Pfizer, General Motors, Office Max, Coca Cola, Delta Air Lines and Lockheed Martin among many, many others. I have been working closely with John Stanfill, our newly appointed Senior Vice President of sales to capitalize on a tremendous interest, commercial real estate firms and brokers show in marketing their listings on CoStar Showcase. CoStar Sales Organization has been busy setting appointments and presenting the new CoStar Showcase service to 1000s of prospects with listings across the U.S. Our sales team has scheduled 1000s of additional CoStar Showcase presentations and follow-up meetings with prospects for the next two months. Many of our sales people are booked up well into August. We expect a large number of these prospects to become CoStar Showcase subscribers.  As an incentive, during initial launch, we have been offering limited trial periods and cancellation options to CoStar Showcase subscribers. These incentives have been extremely effective, but they do not preclude us from including these subscription orders but they do preclude us from including these subscription orders as revenue until they go firm. Therefore we have not included these Showcase contracts in our quarterly bookings number, partly because it was trial offer and the rest of our U.S. subscription contract bookings were lower in the second quarter of 2008, totaling 3.1 million down from the 3.7 million in the first quarter of 2008. However, we fully expect that number to increase as more trials convert into Showcase subscribers in the second half of the year. Already, by the end of the July we believe we will have 1 million in recognizable annual billings from Showcase. We believe that there are two primary factors that are contributing to the search and interest we have seen for CoStar Showcase. The first is we believe CoStar Showcase provides a superior alternative to other solutions available. The second factor is the significant competitor in the space has recently passed on a series of major price hikes alienating many of its clients. We believe in an uncertain economic environment, commercial brokers resent these unreasonable price hikes even more and so they are searching for a good alternative service that can provide them with quality leads from the Internet. CoStar Showcase offers a more effective and convenient solution for those searchers and subscribers. For brokers, who already have the listings in CoStar property the process of adding their listing to CoStar Showcase is practically frictionless. For searchers the process of searching and accessing listings on CoStar Showcase is also practically frictionless. Once more this new online service leverages our existing search operations and cost structure. All the property information is drawn from our listing data base and online image libraries, therefore requiring little additional support or investment other than software development and a pay-per-click budget. It’s a very efficient solution for our subscribers and a high margin product for us. For all these reasons, we believe CoStar Showcase as the potential to be a significant contributor to our earnings growth later in the fourth quarter next year and beyond. Compared with our core subscription-based information sales, which tend to have a sales cycle of months, the sales cycle for CoStar Showcase appears be to a matter of weeks, and the current average Showcase contract size of $7,826 annual compares favorably with our second quarter average information contract value of $7,155 annually. We couldn’t be more pleased to offer our client as compelling and extremely effective solution from marking their listings on the internet. Going forward, I expect Showcase to be one of the primary focuses of our sales organization.  Last call, I updated you on our first and second quarter focus on strategically important, smaller sized firms that had a higher than average number of property listings. As part of this sales effort we made a concerted effort to inform these prospects of CoStar’s comparably priced, higher quality information and the fact that they maybe more affordable than they are perceived. We believe CoStar offers a compelling alternative to those firms who stand to benefit from the value of our higher quality research supported information.  In addition to expanding our customer base, sales to these smaller size firms could also lead to long-term growth opportunities given our historical proven ability to renew and up-sell firms who have become subscribers. For these and other reasons, we thought it was an opportune time to pursue this market segment even though it limited our short-term ability to grow our bookings number. I am pleased to report our efforts in this area over the past two quarters have been a major success contributing to the record number of new subscribing firms we’ve added over the first two quarters of the year and resulting the conversions of thousands of listings to client listings, giving us higher quality data overall there by increasing our value proposition to all of our clients and prospects.  Also as I explained last call, we anticipate that the average contract value would begin to increase back towards historical levels once the sales initiative focusing on smaller sized firms wrapped up late in the second quarter and that has already began to occur. The average net contract value increased from $6,864 in the first quarter of 2008 to $7,155 in the second quarter of 2008. Our special focus on small firms is now completed and over. At the end of the second quarter the company had 128 U.S. subscription sales field reps, eight U.S. advertising sales reps, eight in-house sales reps and 21 U.K. field sales reps for a total of 165 sales representatives. That compares with 171 on staff at the end of the first quarter of this year. Our research department achieved a major milestone during the second quarter by adding the 1 million listing to CoStar's database. To the best of my knowledge this represents the largest aggregation of commercial property information ever assembled within a unified database anywhere in the world. This aggregation represents tremendous value for our subscribers who can now access and compare similarly researched and verified properties across markets coast-to-coast and it further strengthens CoStar’s position as a leading provider of information marketing services for the commercial real estate industry. CoStar pioneered the concept of commercial real estate firms outsourcing their property research functions 20 years ago, fundamentally changing the way commercial real estate professionals access, use and share property information. The astounding number of listings now being accessed today across CoStar's information platform throughout the United States and United Kingdom is a clear indication of how much the industry has changed from the outmoded and inefficient exchange of incomplete paper based information to the much greater efficiency, increased productivity and cost-savings that accrued to the firms and individual brokers who use CoStar.

 : Our research team provides the core data that is the source of our value and identity as a company. They have done an outstanding job in researching all the markets we cover and they continue to demonstrate their value by aggregating more and more listings in an extremely efficient and timely manner. While we have now completed the difficult and labor intensive phase of adding new markets to our database to complete our coverage in the U.S. and expand our coverage in the U.K, we continue to add listings at a brisk pace. We have now taken appropriate steps to stabilize our cost structure and believe the costs associated with maintaining the information is now at a relatively fixed basis.  We continue to make progress in building a strong and U.K. product offering as we had in the United States and work towards the goal of becoming the preeminent source of commercial real estate information in the United Kingdom and eventually all of Europe. Since, introducing many of the same research processes and systems we have in place in the U.S. including field research vehicles the U.K. research team has ramped up its overall productivity and is now in high gear. In fact, I believe that our Glasgow Research Center is developing into one of our best and most productive research centers globally.  The U.K. research team added more than 110 million square feet of available space during the second quarter to bring the U.K. availability database to approximately 1.1 billion square feet. The U.K. availability database is approaching the listing counts we would expect to see on a relative GDP basis.  One sure sign that we are delivering on our customer expectations is the increase in product usage we are seeing in the U.K. as clients continue to log into our system, run more quarries, produce more reports and setup more alerts. Usage of our focus products in the U.K has more than doubled year-over-year from the second quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2008. We firmly believe that the higher overall usage levels bode well for continued high customer renewal rates in the future.  I would also like to briefly update you on the status of one of the law suites that we currently have pending against LoopNet. In November 2007, LoopNet filed a complient over CoStar’s use of listings forwarded to CoStar by broker’s whishing to market their listings on CoStar. Essentially, LoopNet claims when a commercial real estate broker uploads their own listing to LoopNet service that listing becomes a “LoopNet listing” and then LoopNet has the right to restrict how that broker can further market, distribute or use his/her listing information.  LoopNet’s complaint appears to allege that a broker who authors and types the listing into LoopNet may not use the e-mail to a friend function available LoopNet to send that listing to CoStar for inclusion in the CoStar database. Not only do we think that LoopNet’s legal arguments are wrong, but we also thing that the LoopNet customers will be dismayed to discover that LoopNet’s claiming controls and may restrict the marketing and distribution of listings where the brokers themselves have one photographed, uploaded, written and typed.

.: On Friday June 6, CoStar won the motion and the court denied LoopNet’s motion to strike CoStar’s counter claims. Concluding that CoStar had shown a reasonable probability of succeeding on the merits of its claims that LoopNet violated the settlement agreement. LoopNet has now appealed the California judge’s decision.  Not withstanding our expectation that CoStar will prevail in the merits of this case, as far as the discovery process we have gone to the hundreds and hundreds of CoStar researchers and asked them to identify for us any listings they have entered, that have been copied from the public portion of LoopNet’s website. Today we have heard back from virtually all the researchers and out of the 1 million plus active listings currently in our database, they have identified one listing that was obtained from the public portion of LoopNet’s website in the absence of a direct request from a broker to have the listing added to the CoStar database; that’s right, one. We have confirmed that the broker currently responsible for that one listing wanted it on CoStar’s website. Again our investigation today shows that CoStar has not added listing from the public portion of LoopNet’s website unless directed to do so by the broker that created the listing. Ultimately, we believe that because LoopNet has been losing thousands of subscribers over the last few quarters and it appears unable to stop the client exodus, they have out of desperation resorted to suing CoStar in a misguided attempt to salvage their clients enlisting. We are very confident that LoopNet’s lawsuit is completely frivolous and that the exorbitant amount of legal fees being spent by both parties in the courts has been and will continue be a colossal waste of time and money. Unfortunately, CoStar has being engaged in litigation on and off of LoopNet for nearly a decade and at this space we continue to be for the foreseeable future. Our related legal fees are trade as an ongoing regular expanse item and so are reflected in our financials and unlike LoopNet are reflected in our EBITDA and our guidance. We are pleased with the courts recent favorable ruling and we are seeking to recoup our legal fees in our countersuit. We remain confident that LoopNet’s law suite will not impact our ability to show consistent sequential quarterly earnings growth. To read some of the recent pronouncements made in the media on the conditions in commercial real estate markets one might think we are in the midst of the worst downturn in the past 25 to 50 years, but based on our analysis the facts and statistics simply do not support the view that the commercial real estate market is falling into a severe downturn.  Our latest analysis based upon the performance of a core set of major U.S. markets found that the conditions for the office, retail and investor, real estate sectors during the second quarter remained mixed, but many of the most important metrics are well within range of conditions considered healthy by most interpretations. Clearly, it appears that the transaction activity has slowed especially on the sales side. However, many key industry indicators continue to reflect unprecedented strength. Rents are generally at multiyear highs. Construction activity is robust. Vacancy rates have risen, but are generally moderate across the majority of markets and well within the ranges considered healthy. Overall, office absorption remained positive in the second quarter with a total of 7 million square feet net absorption reflecting relatively strong demand. 27 of the core office markets we analyzed, experienced positive absorption this past quarter, while 16 saw a negative absorption, but interestingly reflecting the mixed state of market conditions at midyear, 15 of the core office markets we analyzed saw vacancy decrease over the past year, while office vacancy increased in 26 of the markets.  Eight office markets have vacancy rates below 10%. The office market with the lowest office vacancy rate in the country is also the largest, New York City at 5.6%. A 5.6% vacancy rate is an indication of an extremely tight and strong commercial real estate market.  Another clear indication of market strength can be found in office rental rates, which continued to go up in the second quarter, the 10 consecutive quarterly increase in average office rents. I can tell you first hand, that office rents are more than holding their own. I just received several lease proposals in our sales office in Boston and from what I say at least Boston rents are as healthy as I’ve ever seen them.  We are seeing a slowdown in commercial real estate sales activity but we believe that CoStar has modest exposure to a slowdown in that section. The situation is much the same across industrial and retail property sectors. The fact is commercial real estate marketing conditions have remained fairly resilient. We certainly have not witnessed the Hallmarks of a true commercial real estate downturn characterized by consecutive quarters of clearly raising vacancy rates, falling rents, asset base, negative absorption, CoStar construction activity; rather it appears capital for commercial real estate, both equity and debt remains reasonably available under the terms in 2008, especially compared with the true downturns we had in our early 90’s. Obviously, market conditions are weaker than they were two years ago and could weaken further. More likely, individual markets will strengthen and weaken at different paces, reflecting the underlying strengths of the local economies and their positions in the real estate supply cycle. I believe this only underscores, the way of having access to comprehensive research verified property information that CoStar can provide. Before turning the call over to Brian Radecki, our Chief Financial Officer for a more in-depth discussion of our financial performances and outlook let me reiterate that the company is very focused on adding and retaining subscribers across the U.S and U.K. controlling our costs and enhancing the high-quality of research we conduct. We expect to continue to generate consistent earnings growth as we move into 2008 and into 2009 and beyond. We are very focused on our goal of doubling our EBITDA to achieve 100 million in annualized EBITDA run rate for the company by the end of 2010. Our first goal in the short-term, intermediate term and long-term earnings growth is our long-term earnings growth. I believe this quarter’s results have clearly delivered this goal and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver earnings growth throughout the rest of the year and the following and the following. I want to thank all of the staff in CoStar Group for turning in a tremendous quarter and at this point, I want to turn the call over to Brain Radecki, to go into more detail on the quarter’s numbers. 
Brian Radecki : CoStar posted another strong quarter of earnings growth at the mid-year point. As Andy, mentioned earlier and as we stated in yesterday’s press release net income increased 263% in the second quarter of 2008 to $5.4 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to $1.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007.  EBITDA, which is Earnings before Interest Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for the second quarter of 2008, was $12.8 million, an increase 204% compared to EBITDA of $4.2 million for the second quarter of 2007.  Today I am going to principally focus on the sequential results for the second quarter of 2008, compared to the first quarter and in our outlook for the third quarter and full year of 2008. Total revenue grew sequentially from $52.3 million in Q1 of 2008 to $53.5 million in Q2 of 2008.  Core U.S. subscription revenue increased by 2.9% from Q1 to Q2, which is consistent with the past several quarters. It was slightly offset by lower non-subscription or ad hoc revenue during the quarter. Subscription revenues continue to account for approximately 95.3% from our total revenue during the quarter. Our 12 month trailing customer renewal rate remained strong at 90.9%. The subscription revenues accounting for approximately 95% of our total revenue and the majority of our subscribers on annual agreements, we consider our 12 month trailing customer renewal rate to be a good indicator. Also for the second quarter our customer renewal rate for subscription based services remains solid at 89.7% or as we stated in the press release approximately 90%. All-in-all these are very healthy numbers based on where we are today in the economy.  International revenues increased 3% from Q1 to $6 million in Q2 of 2008. International operations contributed approximately 11% of total revenues in the quarter and international subscription revenues account for approximately 90% of this revenue. Year-over-year international revenues modestly increased by approximately 2%, due to the discontinuation of acquired product offerings that were duplicative, some of the client and certain consulting revenues and an unfavorable impact on exchange rate changes. However, our year-over-year international subscription revenues increased at approximately 10%. Again let me remind everybody, the company has reported sequential revenue increases in every quarter since its IPO in 1998 and through several commercial real estate cycles since Andy founded the business over 20 years ago. We continue to expect that we’ll add new subscribers, renew current subscribers and grow our revenue and earnings through the current economic and real estate cycles.  Speaking of the IPO, that reminds me July 1 marked CoStar Group’s 10-year anniversary of our IPO in becoming a publicly traded company on NASDAQ. A decade ago, I remember thinking of the daunting task ahead of us expanding by market-by-market across the U.S.  During that period of intense investment we produced a consistent pattern of revenue and earnings growth market-by-market all across the U.S. Now a decade later, after completing the major investments required to research both the U.S. and U.K. commercial real estate asset classes, we have leveraged our subscription based business model over relatively fixed cost structure to establish a pattern of increasing profitability, but now on a country level in the U.S. quarter after quarter after quarter.  As Andy stated earlier, after announcing a year ago in Q2 of 2007, our goal of achieving a 30% EBITDA margin in the U.S. by the end of this year, we have nearly reached that goal after four quarters. Now, we have set a new goal of working towards doubling our EBITDA company-wide to 100 million run rate by the end of 2010. We believe this goal is achievable based on our strong subscription based business models and based on the current revenue growth rates in the current economic and commercial real estate environments. Gross margin increased by $2.6 million from $32.5 million in Q1 of 2008, to $35.1 million in Q2 of 2008 on a $1.2 million increase in revenues and a $1.4 million decrease in cost of revenues. Approximately half the decreased in cost of revenues, was directly related to permanent operational and efficiency gains, i.e. the elimination of excess leases across the company, elimination of redundant data cost from recent acquisitions etc, etc. The remainder of the decrease relates to variable finding differences with new hires, headcount and other related costs. Overall, gross margin percentage expanded to $65.7 million in Q2 of 2008 from $62.3 million Q1 of 2008. This increase in both gross margin dollars and percentage demonstrates the strength of our business model. Now, that we have completed the previous step-ups in cost structure, as I’ve stated several times, we expect the majority of revenue added during the quarter to drop directly to the gross margin line as we’ve seen for the past several quarters. Overall, operating expenses increased $1.3 million during quarter from $25.3 million in Q1 to $26.6 million in Q2 as expected. This increase was principally in selling and marketing with the seasonally high expenses from CoStar’s participation in the ICSC trade show in May, along with the cost associated with a successful launch of CoStar Showcase. In more detail, G&A also saw a slight up-tick this quarter due to the termination of a lease and write-off of certain lease-hold improvements that is now saving the company over $1.1 million over the remaining two year term of the lease, as we consolidated excess office space in Maryland, which we discussed last quarter. In addition, legal expenses included in G&A also remained high in Q2 at approximately $900,000. As always we follow GAAP basis accounting and report all of our legal expenses in our income statement, EBITDA number and on our earnings outlook for the year, unlike other companies I am aware of. Throughout the reminder of 2008, we expect the company’s overall operating expenses to remain stable and relatively fixed.  Our revenue growth of $1.2 million coupled with overall expenses, cost of sales plus operating expenses were consistent from Q1 to Q2, resulting in EBITDA for the second quarter of $12.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to EBITDA $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2008. Reconciliation of EBITDA to all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call, to GAAP basis results are shown in detail on our press release issued yesterday. The press release is available on our website at www.costar.com.  Capital expenditures for Q2 of 2008 were approximately $1.2 million. We ended the second quarter of 2008 with approximately $198.3 million in cash, cash equivalents short-term and long-term investments. Also, we have no long-term debt.  Now, I will discuss the outlook for the third quarter of 2008. As indicated in our press release, we expect a sequential quarterly increase in revenue from the second to the third quarter of 2008 from approximately 2% to 4%, with fully diluted net income per share of $0.28 to $0.30 in the third quarter of 2008. We also expect to grow earnings from U.S. operations through 2008 and to 2009 and beyond as a result for the consistent core revenue growth coupled with our relatively fixed cost base. Based on the current visibility and operation of our business we are again raising the outlook for net income for the full year of 2008. The company now expects a $1.10 to $1.15 per diluted share for the full year of 2008. We continue to believe there is upside revenue growth potential later in 2008. Revenue growth continues to be largely depended on the successful management and productivity of the sales force particularly in the unit of revenue opportunities resulting from momentum in established markets, new markets and the new Showcase offering. Now, if our sequential quarterly revenue growth rate does not accelerate as we expect, we continue to expect to meet our updated earnings outlook while possibly coming in at the bottom of our year-over-year annual revenue growth range which we set for this year. For the full year of 2008, we expect approximately $5 million to $6 million in pre-tax non-cash equity compensation charges relating to investing of restricted stock options.  Gross margin percentage is expected to improve slightly from Q2 to Q3 as we continue to leverage our stable U.S. cost structure and identify operational efficiencies. Operating expenses are expected to be relatively fixed or decreased slightly from Q3 to Q2. As we continue to invest internationally the mechanics of our effective tax rate calculation continue to be effected by the amount of income or loss in the U.K. where we do not get an equivalent tax expense plus benefit to offset the U.S. corporate tax. This results in an overall blended effective rate that may increase or decrease over the current rate. We currently continue to expect our overall effective rate to be in the range of 43% to 45% for 2008. In conclusion we continue to expect earnings growth in our core U.S. business operations to be the story for the reminder of 2008. Our Q2 results demonstrate that we are delivering on these expectations. We also expect our international operations to continue to move towards break-even by the end of 2008, while we develop the next generation of international software, which we expect will position us for the long-term growth opportunities in the U.K. and Europe later in 2009 and beyond.  As Andy, stated earlier the entire CoStar management team remains fully committed to achieving the 30% EBITDA margin in the U.S. and break-even in our international operations by the end of 2008 and now working towards our new goal of 100 million in annualized EBITDA for the entire company by the end of 2010. We look forward to reporting that progress to you and with that I will open up the call for any questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Neff with William Blair.
John Neff - William Blair: You mentioned with the Showcase product, you mentioned a fair number of retailers that sounded like they were trying the product. Was that retailer trying it directly or through the brokers? Any sort of -- can you give us maybe an update on sort of the retailer appetite for the product and what you think it could mean as far as penetrating that market? And then, can you give us an updated view on how you’re thinking about capping the listings inventory available on Showcase?
Andrew Florance: I think the product retailers who have access to inventory that are trying to dispose, they would be interested in the product because it would typically while those dispositions are going to be picked up by smaller mom and pops or at retailers and Showcases a great venue to reach a general business audience on the Internet. Also, retail in general, when you get outside the retailers, we’re seeing about a third of the activity on the Showcases coming from retail real estate and that’s a very fragmented part the commercial real estate market often under-served by the brokerage community.  So, a lot of the business community at the smaller end of retailers spending for themselves and CoStar Showcase is an ideal way for them to try to find opportunities. So, we do think that a big part of the growth story in retail and then in Showcase will be around that whole retail segment. I’m surprise to see that the retail segment for us in Showcase is larger, the second element in the office segment’s larger than the industrial segment.  What we intent to do, in your second part of your question, I’m capping how much we’re putting in there, we intent to initially cap at about half of listings in any given metropolitan market can go into Showcase and because of the really great response we’ve received for the product, there are some markets in which I believe we are approaching 30%, of the listings being Showcased. So in those markets I anticipate we will bump up against the 50% cap, but generally across the United States we would be in the -- I would not see us hitting the cap in the substantial number of markets for another year or two and by then we would have an awful lot of revenue from the product. Does that answer your question?
John Neff - William Blair: Yes, yes that’s great and just one more Showcase question. The 587 new subscribing firms you added during the quarter, does that include Showcase or is that for traditional kind of products?
Andrew Florance: That’s traditional.
John Neff - William Blair: With the international revenue growth, can you just remind us of the businesses that were business lines or products that were discontinued and also Brian remind us of why the sharp drop -- in looking at the EBITDA for international, why the sharp drop in corporate expense allocation from a year ago 285,000 from 975?
Brian Radecki: 
 :
 :
 :
John Neff - William Blair: Okay and some of the other Propex kinds of products, like the deal introduction platform and the auction platform, are those part of subscription revenue or are those part of non?
Andrew Florance: Those are part of subscription revenue.
Brian J. Radecki: Yes, there is some marketing components of the Propex. There are some marketing components and if you look at, I mentioned it this time in the call; I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned it before, but the international side I mean it’s not much but they are only at about 90% subscription revenues, so they do have a little bit more variability. So, the Propex component has namely a subscription fees, but there is a small non-subscription fees that goes along with it, so. I think because the U.K. numbers are a little smaller than the U.S. and the fact that they are slightly less, subscription based, it’s still 90% which is high, but a little bit more subject to, variability on the non-subscription or ad hoc type areas.
John Neff - William Blair: And then Andy I was looking for maybe an update on the sales force, if you could update us on the average tenure experience of the sales force, had some time to absorb some of the new folks, your view on sort of headcount growth going forward and then maybe an update on turnover?
Andrew Florance:
 : I would say that our turnover is down, this year over last year and while we are down a little bit quarter-over-quarter in the headcount in sales, I would anticipate that number would fluctuate up and down a little bit and be fairly stable and what we’re focusing on is doing exacting what we’re doing which is continuing to put more training into the existing players that are there, bring that tenure up and build their experience level. So, I’m a pretty comfortable with where that group is and what they’re achieving at this point.

So, I’m a pretty comfortable with where that group is and what they’re achieving at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Maietta with Needham and Company.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co.: First question I had was for you Brian with regard to cash flow, that kind of that bogey of $100 million revenue EBITDA run rate for year-end 2010; it implies some healthy cash flow growth. How shall we think about approximately for cash flow growth? Is that EBITDA growth kind of the best proxy, as you think about it?
Brian Radecki: I think the EBITDA growth is the best proxy and I think if you just took modest revenue growth figures which we’ve been seeing here in the past few quarters and you look at the fact that a high percentage of those revenues dollars are dropping to the bottom line, so you’ll be looking at 70%, 80% are dropping at the bottom line, you can fairly easily calculate on a pretty high-level, getting to the $100 million annual EBITDA before the end of 2010 and that’s how we look at it internally, so that’s how I would expect a lot of investors to be looking at that. It’s also, I hate to say it, but you can pull up our proxy, it’s our bonus too, so that’s what the company is focused on.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co.: Yes, and that really is the base case scenario because I mean you are basically saying, as the market faces today excellent progress in macro growths and things like that…
Brian Radecki : I mean I think we’re looking at where we are today? What's happening today? And, we feel obviously a very good about it. We’ve raised guidance twice this year. Our business model is healthier than anything else I’ve seen. I mean it seems like every time I’ve pick up the paper we are bombarded with negative news, other companies reducing guidance, loosing customers, going out of business and trying to raise more capital and to be honest with you I mean our business is just performing exceptional and it’s healthy as it’s ever been. So, we’re very pleased. 
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co: And then Brian I may have missed it; did you disclose what the cash flow from operations number was for the quarter. I got cutbacks, but not…
Brian Radecki:  I don’t think I talked about it. It was about $8 million.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co: Okay, got it. Then on the -- the other thing I think I missed, you talked about kind of a sequential increase in revenue in Q3 and Q4, but could you reaffirm kind of that 14% to 16% number for the full year?
Brian Radecki: I didn’t reaffirm it. I think what we talked -- what I said was that I think we’re in the 2% to 4% range and that’s where we have been in the last couple of quarters. So, I think we’re kind of still in that 2 % to 4% range, until we see us come out of that. I mean I think obviously the economy and those types of things are going to be a factor in there, but I think that’s a good range that we’re going to be into for quite some time.
Jonathan Maietta - Needham & Co: And then Andy with regard to John coming onboard and running the sales force, is it pretty much the same game plan in terms of running the ball and you plan any chance of sales force compensation or anything like that?
Andrew Florance:  I don’t foresee at this any material change in sales force compensation other than the typical period incentives and special initiatives but I think it’s more of a switching of leadership and leadership style rather than a issue of big restructuring. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated:  I have two questions; one, last call you talked about kind of step up retention efforts and obviously I think that worked pretty well with keeping retention flat at 90%, can you just talk a little bit more about that and also the dynamics of how the sort of marginal smaller commercial brokers health is because I think that’s part of that dynamic.
Andrew Florance :  As we came into the first and second quarter we had implemented some changes to the sales forces compensation plan at the end of ’07 and very beginning of ’08, but we felt it began to take effect as the year went on where we were putting more emphasis on them proactively driving usage up across their book of business and they’ve been doing that and I think that by-and-large the vast majority of folks in the sales force are in good in contact with their clients and that’s keeping the retention at a good level. I can tell you that I discussed the fact that the -- looking at the statistics for what the statistics say in commercial real estate you did not see evidence of any sort of disaster anywhere, the possible exception being slowdown in investment sales, financing on larger projects, but when you’re listening to large numbers of sales calls and sort of the atmosphere out there, you do have extreme anxiety and just pick up a newspaper and reader and the small brokerage firms can read those newspapers too and they are anxious about the outlook, so you got people who are more likely to cancel as a precautionary measure to control their expenses in the event of a downturn and so its making a slightly more challenging environment and in particular it’s at the low end; its still, 1%, 2%, 3% shops who are perhaps taking down their shingle and going back into a larger shop or going into insurance sales or something. So we are holding a reasonably solid retention rate given the psychology of the market right now and interestingly our gross sales number, our ability to sell product is still pretty strong. 
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated: Okay thanks and then just one other sort of color on the reversal of the average sales price or I forget what you guys call the metric, but the change from 6,800 to 7,100 platform. When you look forward what are the major drivers of that continuing to go up over the second half and sort of into ’09?
Andrew Florance:   Well that special incentive program ended mid-May and so that’s going to -- with the elimination of special focus on small firm asking to bring the average number back up and then we are enjoying a period here where we’re signing up some larger dollar Showcase deals which is driving it up as well and then the sales force is becoming more mature which would also drive it up and you could have some smaller Showcase accounts where sales people are going into their existing customers and who don’t have a lot of listing, but good customers and selling them Showcase, which could be a $100 a month sale so as an individual addendum to a contract it’s a small number, but the overall account value will be continuing to grow. So, I would expect the average number to be moving up in the third and fourth quarter inline with what we thought in the first quarter.
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated: Okay, and then last question Brian, can you just repeat the -- or maybe Andy you said this; the number that you’re going to recognize in revenue from Showcase instead of a $1 million was that for 3Q or 2Q, I just missed that statistic.
Andrew Florance: That is the number that by the end of July it appears that we will have achieved in annualized recognizable run rate of $1 million so over the next 12 months what we do in July will be one -- we’re able to call, recognize what revenue in July, where the trails expired, the contracts firm, the one year to two year contracts, so at that point we have a high confidence on a $1 million of revenue. The number, there is not a lot of trails expiring in August and then there is a large number of trails expiring in September and October, a lot of revenue going firm in September and October.
Brian Radecke: And Brett what that is, is it’s not going to -- $1 million drops in from those contracts. I mean what that is that those cancellation provisions passed that the client decided that they’re getting a lot of value from their new service, so that number will then come in over two or three months or something like that. So, it’s not like it’s all going to drop into one month and so there will be a kind of a ramp up as those come, but obviously the more-and-more we pass those cancellation provisions and clients continue to go firm obviously you start to build no that and I think that’s where you could see some upside, late in the year as you build on that numbers.
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated: And is that ratably -- is $1 million ratably ratable over a year or is it coming in differently than that?
Brian Radecki: No, it’s the same as the subscription-based service, so once they go firm depending on the month it is they come in, the monthly subscription-based subscriber, I think that’s why it’s important that you pass those trail periods obviously and then once you do it, it becomes just like any other subscription-based service that we sell and we will include those numbers in our total, you would say 95.3 of the subscription-based services will be included in that number, once they pass that trial period.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: First, I’m just trying to get a feel for how the selling and marketing expense trends from here. I may have missed it, but I didn’t hear too much on that specific portion of OpEx. There was a little step-up in the second quarter. Is that sort of a onetime bounce-back following the first quarter’s low end marketing or is that increased more and more permanent would you say going forward?
Andrew Florance: As I put in my script Vance there was kind of a one-time Q2 high about $700,000, $750,000 for ICSC. Otherwise I think it will be relatively stable now. So, you could see a decrease a little bit because that’s only a one-time thing during the second quarter that doesn’t happens in the rest of the year, but that would be somewhat offset on a pay-per-click budget and some other marketing efforts surrounding the new Showcase offering. So you could see a slight decline, but I wouldn’t count dollar-for-dollar that coming off of there, but otherwise besides ICSC I think you had a pretty nice level that you’re going to be at for while. 
Brian Radecki : And you’ll see that ICSC bounce again in second quarter of ‘09. 
Andrew Florance: Correct. Every second quarter you’ll see a very similar number for ICSC between $700,000 and $800,000.
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley:
 :
Andrew Florance: No, it’s actually -- I would actually focus on the fact that the number of firms coming on, the net firms coming on is actually fairly stagnant about the same number, which is a second highest we’ve seen ever. So, the number of net new firms come out, a second highest ever. I think what happened as much as anything as in the United Kingdom would be integration of our shop property product into our general information product. Our retail product was integrated to our general product as well as we were cleaning up with the acquisition of these 12, 13 different companies being blended together in the United Kingdom, we are getting a lot of consolidation going on. So, you got the screen data office information products being superseded by the focus office information product, the shop property information product being encompassed into the focus information product. So a lot of that’s going on in the U.K. that dropped those counts and then the other thing that’s going on which is sort of somewhere between the subscription revenue product and the one off revenue product, but we’re counting it in our authorized user account. The market for lower cost for sale information, our CLMS product, that market is weak. People who are traditionally paying us $29 a month, it’s our lowest cost product of all. People are paying us $29 a month for information only on fore sale properties, particularly like in the California and Florida, those folks are going away. So, if you have exposure to low end fore sale players, that’s weak. Now the good news is those folks -- where there’s those folks falling off, they are probably in eight of our average authorized user value. So, I think the number was weak but its elements of it in the United Kingdom were purely mechanical and then if you had to choose some reduction area it would be CLMS because of the low value. That’s CLMS to be under the same kind of pressure until Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock comes back up to what it was last year.
Andrew Florance:  And just you know I mean that the CLMS is barely over a $1 million in total revenue and it’s not subscription based, it’s pretty ad hoc, so I think we have very, very little exposure in that area, as a company. 
Vance Edelson – Morgan Stanley: Okay that’s helpful, and just a final follow up on the sales force question earlier with a total number of sales reps down just a bit. Could you provide a little more color on the decline there? Is that entirely voluntary departures or are you doing any kind of trimming of the lower performers for example?
Andrew Florance:  The company will always look at trimming folks who -- which is just not a good fit for them, that will happen. So that’s probably the normal process that goes on and then I think we’ve got -- part of it is we are proactively trimming people that perhaps would be more successful somewhere else. The third is probably people that understand that’s on the rise and that there is probably people who are voluntarily choose to pursue other options and typically those folks go into brokerage working for our customers. So, I’ll say that for the voluntary left, they’re all probably CoStar users now. 
Andrew Florance:  Yes and if you look at that number it’s still fairly consistent, it only dropped by a few bodies and then we didn’t want to have a bunch of new training class while we are brining in a hundred and some people for advanced training in July. 
Brain Radecki:  Correct. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Wilson with JMP Securities.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities:  Two questions; so the first was as you’re finding new customers and signing people up on Showcase, have you any success or what would be your strategy or the opportunity trying to kind of cross sell them, other CoStar products and do see levels of interests a little early in those kind of discussion?
Andrew Florance: Jim, I’m waiting with bated breath for exactly that. So, initially a lot of our primary focus is going into our best existing customer base and selling them Showcase as an add-on to the existing contract and that is the complicated reasons that would be to them, potential cost savings to buy Showcase. Secondarily, we’re going into the 10,000 best potential new prospects for who don’t currently buy anything from CoStar Group and we’re going in using a marketing hook, a lead generation hook in the form of CoStar Showcase and our hope would be that maybe they initially weren’t thinking about information product, but once we got in them and began to develop the client relationship with them on the Showcase side, they find value in it, we get our reps could establish a relationship with them and we could begin a cross sell, up-sell process using the marketing as the entry point, instead of the traditional attack using the information. I’ll tell you right now, in an environment where people are a little more anxious, it’s absolutely serendipity that we have the ability to switch from saying, we can help you with information products that enable you to efficiently handle high volumes of transactions, we can switch our pitch and our sales force too, we can keep your lead flow coming in the door using Showcase to capture, the tens to thousands of business searching for commercial on the web, so we’re shifting to a revenue increased story off of an efficiency streamline story and it’s great from that perspective and they’re receptive.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Okay. Good. And then my other question is, had the total growth, revenue growth hit a quarter, how much came from existing customers adding new markets and products and how much came from, new customers?
Brian Radecki : I think it’s probably very similar to what we’ve seen in the past, although I think Andy and I probably would expect that number to start coming more towards from our current clients kind of skewing our historical average of little bit, which as always said has been about 50/50, because of showcase, because as Andy said we are targeting our best clients first. So I think as you move towards the back half of the year, that number might move a little bit more towards current clients, but I think in this quarter it was probably about the same we have seen for past decade.
Andrew Florance:  So I would anticipate that over the next two quarters, that would probably be our -- the highest the ratio ever goes skewing towards revenue growth from existing customers.
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  Okay good and part of that is going to be I guess maybe your existing customer base or probably the bigger and stronger players in those markets and probably obviously therefore financing better shape and it’s easier for them to spend money than the small guys who aren’t doing so well.
Andrew Florance: That’s certainly true. You look at the -- we are fortunate that our core customer base is at the upper end of the pyramid and they are benefiting to some degree from the leading out that’s going on where a lot of the smaller entrepreneurial folks have started up in the last year or two are losing their nerve. CB Richard Ellis or a Jones Lang Lasalle, premier brand, when the transaction volume goes down 25% those premier brands can go coach business from the marginal players and keep their shares stable and as we are seeing so that the easiest ones are sell to right now.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Chris Mammone with Deutsche Bank
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank:  Just a back to the quarter revenue growth; I know your currently at the lower end of the range announced. I guess could you expand on maybe what factors maybe beyond on showcase could help you, maybe get back to the higher end of that range in the back half of the year.
Andrew Florance:  Well, I would say that, yes so we are at basically the middle of the range and the guidance and similar to what we had last time and I would say that anyway look at it, showcase appears to dramatically exceed our expectations and that would move us up to the upper end of the range if it continues to do that the way looks like it’s doing, if that goes, else you are looking at your more traditional business, but it is where it is. I think right now we have I would say the highest number of pending demonstration, sales meetings we’ve ever had as a company and I would not be surprised if -- I think we’ve got something like two thousand sales presentations schedule for July and begin of August which is by far the largest number we’ve ever had and that’s showcase.
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank:
 :
Andrew Florance:  Well, Chris, we actually fell like here one of our major national customers -- we basically just flow that data through to you the day that we brought online. So if you were already an institutional customer that subscribed to the first 80 markets, since we added the additional 80 markets they just showed up. So its more of the same way for that national customer. Every single day even in our oldest shows like Washington DC, we’re discovering new, more and more building, so we probably add a couple 100 buildings a month that we discovered in Washington every single month and those buildings just flow into the information system for all the clients in Washington automatically and we don’t charge for them. The same thing is true as we add Reno in Nevada into the network for the institutional national customers, it just grows in. Now, some customers were they don’t subscribe for the whole country, for example that would be CB Richard Ellis's and that mega deal we did with them ,the $100 million plus deal, that would be specifically were they want to step up and get all those markets in one step. They’re our biggest customers and they are now onboard with us 80 markets and I know that our major accounts team is moving through. There are other customers and one of the other top two players out there, one of the semi-peers to CB actually express interest in doing a similar kind of deal what CB did, so we are sort of moving through it, but it’s probably relatively early stage on that.
Operator: Our final question comes from Michael Grossman with MFS Investment.
Michael Grossman - MFS Investment: Just looking at your balance sheet with 200 million in cash and generating kind of $50 million to $60 million a year in free cash flow and it doesn’t sound like giving your 2010 EBITDA target, you know that your going to be making any kind of major investment in the interim period, what do you plan to do with the excess cash here, it’s kind of bring the whole I guess at a pretty low interest rate right now on the returns?
Andrew Florance: Right. The interest rate certainly it’s not existing out there right now and in real terms it is negative. So the -- obviously the -- it is exactly the kind of problem a CEO likes to wrestle with which is too much cash and we are at each quarter, every board meeting we are looking at the options, alternative share buyback dividends and the like in the boards considering them. In the uncertain environment I think the board expressed a view that they wanted move slower rather than quicker and in making a decision of what to do there and we also cannot rollout the potential acquisitions where a CoStar Group quite the operations of another company and create or make significant cost cuts and come up with some very accretive acquisitions and those acquisitions could potentially both domestically and internationally run anywhere from $50 million to well in excess of $100 million. So we like to have the strong balance sheet to continue keep those options opened.
Michael Grossman: Great. Thanks.
Andrew Florance: Thank you. I want to thank everyone for joining us on this second quarter 2008 conference call and again I want to thank to staff for turning out an outstanding performance in the second quarter and giving us a really good quarter. Thank you.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-16 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Tim Trainor - Communications Director Andrew Florance - Founder, CEO and President Brian Radecki - CFO
Analysts: Jon Maietta - Needham & Company Jim Wilson - JMP Securities John Neff - William Blair Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated
Operator: At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2008 conference call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Trainor, you may begin your conference.
Tim Trainor: Thank you, Tia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CoStar Group's first quarter 2008 conference call. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Andrew Florance, let me state that certain portions of this discussion contain forward-looking statements which involve many risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those stated in CoStar's first quarter 2008 press release and CoStar's filings with the SEC, including CoStar's form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2007, under the heading "Risk Factors." All forward-looking statements are based on information available to CoStar on the date of this call, and CoStar assumes no obligation to update these statements. You can find a webcast of this conference call at www.costar.com/corporate/investor. Thank you for joining us. I will now turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Tim. I want to apologize for us getting going with a late start there on the phone call. We like to start more promptly than that. We had a minor technical difficulty. But, again, I apologize and welcome everyone to the first quarter 2008 conference call. I'm very pleased to report that CoStar Group continued the earnings momentum we began to generate last year, and we posted another strong performance in the first quarter, one in which we added a large number of new subscribers and achieved better than expected earnings growth. By executing our strategy of adding and retaining subscribers and managing our cost structure while taking advantage of the opportunities, through our U.S. national expansion and our expanded U.K. operations, we generated solid earnings growth for the past three consecutive quarters, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so. First quarter net income increased 178% over the same period one year ago to $5 million or $0.26 per diluted shared compared to $1.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter 2007. EBITDA for the first quarter 2008 was $11.5 million, an increase of 128% compared to EBITDA of $5 million in the first quarter of 2007. Revenues for the first quarter 2008 were $52.3 million, a 16.6% increase over the first quarter 2007 revenues of $44.8 million and a 2.8% increase from fourth quarter 2007 revenues of $50.8 million. As of March 31, 2008, we had $193.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. CoStar Group has no long-term debt. Brian will address the first quarter results in more detail and provide some color on our outlook for the rest of the year and our decision to increase our guidance. Before he does, I'd like to talk about some of the trends and opportunities we see as a company as well as some of the new services and initiatives we have planned and how we anticipate they will contribute to our earnings and revenue growth. Demand for our information products remains strong. We continue to add a large number of new users, signed the largest number of new customer firms in a single quarter ever, and we enjoyed a high renewal rate, all of which contribute to our strong first quarter earnings growth. Overall, subscriber growth in the first quarter was very strong. We added 2,071 net new paying individual subscribers to bring our total subscriber count to 90,822. In total, we added 591 net new subscribing firms in the U.S., the most net new customers we've ever sold to in a single quarter. 591 new firms compares to 526 firms added in the fourth quarter of 2007 and 535 firms added a year ago during the first quarter 2007. Much of that subscriber growth can be attributed to our decision, which I discussed in last quarter's call, to concentrate the efforts of our sales team on a strategically important market segment for us, smaller sized brokerage companies that have an inordinately high number of listings where those companies are not currently our customers. We target these specific small firms, because with an average of 32 listings each, they control a higher number of listings on average than does a typical small firm, which would be expected to have one or two commercial property listings. Since these firms would normally only purchase one or two licenses, thereby representing lower average contract values, these firms would normally not be a high priority for our sales teams. Despite the fact that the subscription revenue from these firms may not be the highest, they're valuable to have as clients, because these small firms tend to give our researchers more detailed information on their listings and deals when they become clients. We would still collect their content if they were not clients, but it's easier to do so and results in higher quality if they are clients. Many of these small prospects with high numbers of listings have recently experienced steep price increases from other vendors, so we thought it was an opportune time to go after them. Our efforts in this area over the last two quarters have been a major success and thousands of listings have been converted to client listings, giving us overall higher quality data and thereby increasing our value proposition to all of our clients and prospects. Given our historical ability to renew and up-sell firms once they become subscribers and benefit from the value of our higher quality research report information, we believe that expanding our customer base could be immediately beneficial from a sales perspective and we expect it will also lead to long-term growth opportunities. For these and other reasons, we believe there was value to targeting these previously untapped segments. And as I reported last quarter, we implemented a number of incentives for our sales teams and certain special pricing offers to focus our salespeople on selling into these smaller accounts. As I indicated, this incentive program essentially covers the first half of the year, by which time I believe we will have largely accomplished our strategic objectives in this segment. We are well aware that we made a decision that was a clear tradeoff between maximizing contract bookings during the quarter and gaining an intermediate term competitive advantage. While this incentive program has been very successful in signing a large number of contracts, the relatively small size of the firms results in contracts at a much smaller average price point, which also results in a lower average contract price for the quarter overall. The average new contract value decreased 26% quarter-over-quarter from 9,277 in the fourth quarter 2007 to 6,864 in the first quarter 2008. Because of that, U.S. subscription contract bookings were also lower in the first quarter 2008, totaling 3.7 million, down from 5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. As we complete this initiative in the second quarter, we anticipate the average contract value will increase significantly back towards historical norms. Showcase will be a primary priority for the sales force for the rest of 2008. And with a current average contract value of $11,400 annually, it will put upward pressure on our average contract values and our quarterly bookings. We believe the strategy of targeting these strategically important smaller size firms will continue to generate a record number of new subscribing firms through the end of the second quarter. Our customer renewal rate was slightly lower in the quarter, but still at 90%. The renewal rate is slightly lower due to January seasonality, some customer anxiety, given the negative media that's out there, and an increase in bad debt. At 90%, the renewal rate remains the highest in our industry by a wide margin, which I believe affirms the usefulness of our information and its central function are subscribers day to day missing critical business activity. In order to try to increase the renewal rate back to 92%-plus range, we are reemphasizing training customer attention focus within our sales force. At the end of the first quarter, the company had 131 U.S. subscription sales reps, 9 U.S. advertising sales reps, 7 in-house sales reps and 24 U.K. field sales reps for a total of 171 quota-carrying sales representatives. This compares with 169 on staff at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Commercial real estate market conditions are mixed right now. They are neither clearly negative nor are they universally positive. Many key industry indicators reflect unprecedented strengths right now. Rents are generally at multi-year highs. Property asset values are at multi-year highs. Cap rates remain low. Construction activity is robust. Vacancy rates are generally moderate and well within range considered healthy for a commercial real estate market. There are pockets of rising vacancy rates in a number of U.S. markets, but there is no clear dramatic national trend one way or another in the vacancy rates. Absorption, leasing activity and sales volumes are trending down. Let me make it clear. Commercial real estate is not experiencing the obvious negative market conditions that residential real estate is currently experiencing. In my mind, the proper commercial real estate downturn is characterized by consecutive quarters of clearly rising vacancy rates, falling rents and asset values, negative absorption and stalled construction activity. The plain reality here is that the expected downturn that many have been expecting has so far failed to clearly materialize. Based on our analysis, the facts and statistics in this commercial real estate market do not support the conventional wisdom that the commercial real estate market is in a significant downturn. Our latest analysis based on performance of a core set of major U.S. markets that CoStar researchers tracked since 2000 found that office, retail and industrial rental rates finished the quarter at multi-year highs, while demand for commercial real estate did soften somewhat this past quarter. Total office absorption remained positive at just 655,000 square feet this past quarter compared to a much higher 14.6 million square feet of positive absorption one year ago. We expect this number will likely be revised upwards as more deals are captured. Retail turned in the strongest first quarter performance of the three major property types with positive absorption of 10.3 million square feet, although still down from 26.8 million square feet of retail absorption one year ago. Again, this number will likely be revised upwards as more transactions for the quarter come in to our researchers. The biggest change took place in the industrial property sector, which dipped into negative territory for the first time since 2002, posting 1.4 million square feet of negative absorption this quarter compared to 40.9 million square feet of positive absorption one year ago. Construction levels, which had been trending somewhat lower, essentially remained unchanged during the quarter. The total amount of office space under construction was 142 million square feet compared to 134 million square feet last quarter, a 6% increase from last quarter and a 2% decrease from the first quarter 2007. These are not meaningful changes. Industrial construction totaled 118 million square feet compared to 126 million square feet last quarter. This represents a 7% drop over the last quarter's level and a 27% drop from the previous year, a slightly more significant change. A total of 104 million square feet of retail space was under construction at the end of the first quarter, just a 3% change from the 101 million square feet under construction last quarter, but a 20% decrease over the same time last year. Declining absorption levels combined with modest levels of continued new development has caused a national vacancy rate to go up just slightly in each of the property types. Office vacancy rates edged up just slightly from 11.2% at the end of last year to 11.5% in the first quarter, while the industrial rates went from 8.3% to 8.5% and retail rates went from 6.4% to 6.6%. We also see mixed results in the commercial real estate capital markets. The changes we've seen to date can just as easily be characterized as a return to mean rather than a dramatic drop off as sales activity came from superheated levels they reached over the past 24 months. Office sales volume was down 36% from the same quarter last year from $20 billion to $18 billion, but only down 5% from levels we saw two years ago. The average office sales price rose 19% over year-ago levels from $240 to $280 per square foot and is up 41% over the average sales price from two years ago. Average office cap rates are 14 basis points lower than the same quarter last year from 7.1% to 7.0% and 57 basis points lower than two years ago. In the industrial property market, sales volume was down 11% from $7.3 billion in the fourth quarter 2006 to $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2007. Industrial sales volume is down 18% from two years ago. However, the average industrial sales prices are up 7% higher than last year at this time and also 9% higher than two years ago at $67 per square foot. And cap rates for industrial property sales are lower, averaging 7.2%, 45 basis points lower than one year ago and 78 basis points lower than two years ago. Retail property sales volume is down 36% from the same quarter last year from $6.2 billion to $4 billion, down 44% from sales volume levels two years ago. The average sales price for retail property increased 21% over year-ago levels from $149 per square foot to $180 per square foot and 29% higher compared with average sales prices from two years ago. All in all, we believe the first quarter market conditions remain fairly resilient. Obviously, the market could weaken further. We believe that any further softening would have a greater impact on revenue growth than on earnings growth. In last quarter's call, I addressed CoStar's proven ability to operate profitably through real estate cycles. We have successfully managed our business through several real estate cycles over the years. As each cycle has come and gone, we have grown the total number of subscribers, increased revenues every quarter since our IPO more than a decade ago. So far, this downcycle has failed to fully appear. Again, I want to reiterate that while residential real estate is in a clearly down market with almost all indicators in a significant decline, commercial real estate is not showing clear or consistent, across-the-board signs of being in a downcycle. As I reported in our last call, we have taken appropriate steps to stabilize our cost structure after substantially completing the multimillion dollar investment required to complete our coverage of the U.S. and U.K. commercial real estate markets. Having completed the difficult and very expensive phase of adding the additional markets to our database, we believe that costs associated with maintaining the information our research teams evaluated in those markets have stabilized and may decline over time. Of course, the job of updating, verifying and enhancing information we provide our subscribers never ends. Based on current patterns of growth in our listing database, we project that our research team will add the one-millionth listing to CoStar's database sometime during the second quarter of this year. To the best of my knowledge, this represents an unprecedented and unmatched aggregation of commercial property information within a unified database. We believe that to try and replicate the breadth and scale of the property information CoStar's researchers assembled would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Our research team provides the core data that is the source of our value and identity as a company. The fact that they have done an outstanding job in researching these new markets and aggregating so many listings in such an efficient and timely manner in no way infers that our job is done, but the cost structure has been stabilized. Total research and verified commercial real estate listings in the CoStar's U.S. database grew 23% year-over-year from approximately 724,000 in the first quarter of 2007 to approximately 889,000 in the first quarter 2008. In total, between both the U.S. and U.K., the company had approximately 985,000 active listings in our database, and the total U.S. square footage of gross building area tracked and maintained by CoStar now exceeds 57 billion feet. By the end of the quarter, our U.S. research team tracked detailed information on more than 2.15 million individual properties across all types and classes of commercial real estate. The total number of retail listings in our U.S. database at the end of the first quarter was 390,000 listings, and our database of for-sale listings continued to expand during the first quarter, adding 14,398 new properties listed for sale for a total of 340,000 with an aggregate value of $450 billion. And I am also pleased to report great progress towards our goal of becoming the preeminent source of commercial real estate information in the United Kingdom and eventually all of Europe by building as strong U.K. product offering as we have currently in the United States. Last year, we made a number of key executive appointments, opened a new Glasgow-based research center and restructured our research operations. We introduced many of the same processes and systems we have in place in the U.S. in order to achieve the same degree of accuracy and comprehensive coverage that remains one of our key value propositions in the United States. The U.K. research team is now in high gear and has added nearly 126 million square feet of available space in the first quarter alone, taking the U.K. database to 957 million square feet, a 15% increase from the fourth quarter 2007. The total number of listings in the U.K. increased from 54,560 in March of 2007 to 840,000 in March of 2008. The U.K. database is now approaching the sort of levels we would expect to see relative to the U.S. on a GDP basis. This impressive growth has been accompanied by an increase in overall productivity and implementation of rigorous quality assurance processes similar to the ones used in our U.S. research operations, including a telephone recording and training system. This valuable coaching tool has enabled managers to impart best practices and effective strategies for making the most of client interactions. I believe that our Glasgow Research Center is now one of our best and most productive research centers globally. Not surprisingly, our clients and prospective clients are taking note of our improved research quality. We believe the improved quality and comprehensiveness of our information will translate into increased sales over time as we work to become the clearinghouse for property listings in the United Kingdom. Revenues attributable to our European operations increased year-over-year from $4.65 million in the first quarter 2007 to $5.86 million in the first quarter of 2008. We believe that the quality of our European management team now in place, our improved technology and our experience in our European operations and the demand we are seeing from our client base for a standardized research-verified information service will continue to give us the competitive advantage in that marketplace. One sure sign that we are delivering our customer expectations is the increase in product usage we're seeing in both the U.S. and U.K. as clients continue to log into our system, run more queries, produce more reports and set up more alerts. Usage of our U.K. products has doubled first quarter over first quarter and continues to grow. In fact, usage of our FOCUS product in the U.K. recorded its highest ever customer usage level earlier this month, reaching a level that was roughly 250% higher than the level we were seeing in the first quarter of 2007. In the U.S., total customer usage increased 15% in the first quarter over the fourth quarter 2007. We strongly believe that the higher overall usage levels bodes well for continued high customer renewal rates into the future. Another area of our business where I was pleased to see substantial progress made in this past quarter was our ongoing efforts to protect legitimate subscribers from those who seek to fraudulently gain access to our information or who otherwise use our images or information illegally. Unfortunately, when you provide an extremely valuable service, some will attempt to use it without paying for it. Our clients expect us to take every reasonable measure to ensure that they are the ones who benefit from the competitive advantage of CoStar's information services and that those who aren't paying for it and resort to theft aren't getting the benefit. Fortunately, technology is available today that makes it very easy to detect theft and identify illegal password sharing. To help protect customers and combat data theft, we have established an internal anti-piracy group that uses extensive fraud-detection technology to continually monitor CoStar's online information products and detect and prevent unauthorized access. In the past year, CoStar obtained in excess of $1.7 million in court-awarded judgments and out-of-court settlements as a result of our anti-piracy efforts. These judgments included $1 million against Centers & Malls, a company that stole and unlawfully resold CoStar's retail database, and a judgment of $100,000 against two other companies that shared a single passcode to gain access to CoStar's information service. CoStar has received additional significant out-of-court settlements with a number of companies engaged in passcode sharing, and we will continue to prosecute individuals and firms that engage in this unlawful activity. Last call, I briefed you on an assessable lawsuit involving CoStar and a competitor. In that case, we challenged the competitor on the grounds that it was wildly overstating its online audience of 2.5 million registered users, giving prospective property listers a misleading perception number of people who actually use their service. In a statement that appeared to validate CoStar's false advertising lawsuit, the competitor's CEO admitted at an investor conference in February that it does not have 2.5 million active users. The day after the first quarter ended on April 1st, we expanded our user base in Atlanta, a key market for the Southwest U.S., by acquiring the online commercial real estate information assets of First CLS, an Atlanta-based provider of local commercial real estate information operating as The Dorey Companies and DoreyPRO. Under the agreement, former DoreyPRO customers will use CoStar's information service and will be served by the company's existing Atlanta research and sales team. Essentially, we acquired this local competitor's non-duplicative client contracts at a cost of approximately three times EBITDA with a potential earnout that could bring the total cost up to five times EBITDA. The conversion process is proceeding very smoothly, and we are pleased to expand our client base in this strategically important market without incurring significant additional overhead. We basically believe that this revenue transfers over the operation without almost any increase in cost. Given the current economic environment, we believe this is a good time to focus on similar, low-risk, immediately accretive acquisitions. This is not the time, in our opinion, to try to expand in new areas or invest in new software ventures with all the risks and additional support costs that would accompany such endeavors. Currently, we are more interested in doing acquisitions like this Dorey acquisition, which are creative, and we'll be pursuing those as they present themselves. Finally, I want to quickly provide an update on our new marketing service called CoStar Showcase that we plan to release in the next several weeks. We have downloaded this new service to a select group of our existing clients, and quite frankly, the response has significantly exceeded our expectations. Prior to launch and with limited marketing, we have signed more than $0.25 million in annual contract value. And this morning, I was watching that number climb pretty significantly. These contracts do have a trial period, and they do have an option to cancel. So, we wouldn't be booking the revenue for another quarter. Based on the response we've received to date, we believe CoStar Showcase will be a very compelling and effective solution for those interested in marketing their listings online. Using a substantial web traffic generated at costar.com and at leading search engines through the latest keyword linking strategies, we've created an all new marketing service for displaying property listings to this online audience. From both the user and advertiser's perspective, CoStar Showcase will provide a number of advantages over other online property marketing services. One, it will be a completely open system with no registration barriers. All the listings that subscribers select to post will be available online to anyone who visits costar.com and will be readily accessible through very basic and straightforward search functionality. Secondly, posting content will be a very simple process. Once you've become a subscriber, your listings will automatically appear on the external CoStar Showcase site with the appropriate listing content, including images, space available and description, with no extra keying in text or uploading images. Third, listings market on CoStar Showcase will benefit from one-click access from costar.com, Google, Yahoo! and other major websites and search engines. We believe the keyword linking strategy and the audience we expect CoStar Showcase to attract will prove effective at generating inquiries for those who list their properties online. We believe those responsible for finding tenants or buyers for commercial properties will find that CoStar Showcase can provide a competitive advantage for marketing online listings by providing additional valuable exposure and generating qualified inquiries from a large audience of potential prospects. We also believe CoStar Showcase has the potential to be a significant contributor to our revenue in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Our experience in marketing this service to date has been very positive. Compared with our core subscription-based information sales, which tend to have a sales cycle of a couple weeks or even months, the sales cycle for CoStar Showcase appears to be a matter of days. And, again, the average contract size of $11,400 is larger than our first quarter average contract value of $6,846. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I want to reiterate that the company is very focused on adding and retaining subscribers across the U.S. and U.K., controlling our costs, pursuing customer service excellence, enhancing the already high quality of research we conduct, expanding the type of services that we provide to our clients and reaching out and finding thousands of prospects out there who will find real value in the array of marketing information and services we offer. We have moved quickly to maximize the opportunity we created from our investments in the U.S. and U.K. to generate consistent earnings growth as we move through 2008 and into 2009. As you may have heard me state in previous calls, our first goal is long-term, intermediate-term and short-term earnings growth. I believe this quarter's results have clearly delivered on that earnings goal, and our raising guidance today shows our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver on that goal throughout the rest of this year. At this point, I will turn the call over to Brian.
Brian Radecki: Thank you, Andy. As stated in the press release last night, net income accelerated in the first quarter of 2008, increasing 178% over the same period one year ago to $5 million or $0.26 per diluted share compared to $1.8 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2007. Now, I am going to focus principally on the sequential results for the first quarter 2008 compared to the fourth quarter 2007 and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2008. Total revenues grew sequentially by 2.8% from Q4 2007 to Q1 of 2008, increasing from $50.8 million to $52.3 million. Core U.S. subscription revenue increased by 3% from Q4 of 2007 to Q1 of 2008, consistent with last quarter. And our renewal rate remained solid at 90.3 for the quarter. International operations contributed 11.2% of total revenues, and total subscription revenues for the company continued to account for 95% of revenues during Q1 of 2008. International revenues decreased slightly from $6.1 million in Q4 of 2007 to $5.9 million in Q1 of 2008, mainly due to lower foreign currency exchange rates and a slightly lower ad hoc revenue during the quarter. Quarterly international subscription revenue sequential growth remained relatively consistent with the business. Again, let me remind everybody the company has reported sequential revenue increases at every quarter since its IPO in 1998 and through several commercial real estate cycles since 1987 when Andy founded the business. We have and continue to expect that we will add and renew subscribers, increase usage and grow our revenue each quarter through the current economic and real estate environment. Gross margin increased by $1.7 million from $30.8 million in Q4 of 2007 to $32.5 million in Q1 of 2008 on a $1.4 million increase in revenues. Overall, gross margin percentage expanded to 62.3% in Q1 of 2008 from 60.6% in Q4 of 2007, as expected. This increase in both gross margin dollars and percentage demonstrates the strength of our subscription-based business model. Now that we have completed the step-up and research costs, all of the revenue during the quarter dropped directly to the gross margin line. Excluding the lease settlement gain in Q4 of 2007, overall operating expenses decreased approximately $800,000 from $26.1 million in Q4 of 2007 to $25.3 million in Q1 of 2008. This decrease was principally in selling the marketing due to the completion of multiple direct mail campaigns in Q4 2007. Our revenue growth coupled with our lower operating expenses in Q1 resulted in EBITDA for the first quarter of $11.5 million, an increase of $2.3 million or 26% compared to EBITDA of $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Again, please note that I excluded the $7.6 million one-time gain of our London lease settlement for comparative purposes here. Reconciliation of EBITDA and all non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to get basis results is shown in detail on our press release issued yesterday. The press release is available on our website at www.costar.com. Capital expenditures for Q1 of 2008 were approximately $1.5 million, which is well within our expected range for the quarter. As Andy stated, we ended the first quarter with approximately $193.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. And, again, the company had no long-term debt. Now, I will discuss the outlook for the second quarter of 2008. As indicated in our press release, we anticipate a sequential quarterly increase in revenue from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2008 of approximately 2% to 4% and fully diluted net income per share of approximately $0.24 to $0.26 in the second quarter, which includes the seasonally high selling and marketing expenses associated with the ICSC trade show and the pending release of CoStar Showcase. In addition, during the second quarter the company expects a charge of approximately $300,000 resulting from the termination of a lease and write-off of certain leasehold improvements that will save the company approximately $1.2 million over the remaining two-year term of the lease as we consolidate excess office space in Maryland. This savings is a direct result of management's focus on identifying operational efficiencies in the business that reduce both short-term and long-term costs. As we have previously stated, we continue to expect to grow earnings from the U.S. operations through 2008 as a result of the consistent core revenue growth and our relatively fixed cost base. Based on the strong first quarter results and our confidence that we'll be able to execute our plan, we have raised the outlook for net income for the full year of 2008 to approximately $1.05 to $1.10 per diluted share. We also continue to anticipate for 2008 overall revenue growth in the range of 14% to 16% over 2007. Our full year guidance also takes into account the effect of lower overall interest rates and our cash balances compared to last year. We continue to believe there is upside sequential revenue growth potential in the back half of 2008. Revenue growth continues to be largely dependent on the successful growth and productivity of the sales force, particularly in the view of revenue opportunities that we believe may result from momentum in the established markets, new markets, new products like CoStar Showcase and international opportunities. Gross margin percentage is expected to continue to improve from Q1 to Q2 as we leverage our stable U.S. cost structure. Also, operating expenses are expected to increase slightly, as I discussed, due to ICSC's trade show and the anticipated release of Showcase. As we continue to incur losses internationally, the mechanics of our effective tax rate calculation continue to be affected by the amount of income or loss in the U.K. where we do not get an equivalent tax expense or benefit to offset the U.S. corporate tax. This results in an overall blended tax rate, which may increase or decrease over the current rate. We continue to anticipate our overall effective rate in the range of 43% to 45% for 2008. In conclusion, we continue to expect earnings growth from our core U.S. business, and that will be the story for 2008. Our Q1 results demonstrate that we are delivering on these expectations. We also expect our international operations to continue to move towards breakeven by the end of 2008 while we develop the next generation of international software, which will position us for long-term growth opportunities in the U.K. and Europe later in 2009 and beyond. I can truly say the entire CoStar management team remains fully committed to achieving the 30% EBITDA margin in the U.S. and breakeven in our international operations by the end of 2008 as cost structures for the various investments previously made are expected to remain relatively stable as we grow our revenue and significantly leverage earnings. We look forward to reporting our progress to you. And with that, I'll open up the call for questions. Operator, are you with us?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jon Maietta with Needham & Company.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: Hey, thanks very much. Hi, Andy. Hi, Brian.
Andrew Florance: Hi.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: The first question I had, Andy, I was wondering if you could talk qualitatively about any differences in behavior with regard to your larger customers today in this environment versus the smaller customers on purchase decisions.
Andrew Florance: Yes. There is no question that the general anxiety in the economy is causing people to take a little bit longer in the sales cycle. So, people are putting off some decisions here and there. I would have to say, though, our middle to upper clients are very stable with us in this environment. These are situations where they absolutely need this information that we provide, and they're not going to try to save money by replicating our information processes in-house and our research processes in-house. It is dramatically cheaper to outsource to us. Where we see friction right now in the cycle is with the very small firms. So, the 1%, 2%, 3%, 5% sort of marginal customers. Those are the folks who may have been new to the industry in the last several years and are losing confidence. So, it's really strong in the middle-upper, a little weaker at the small client.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: Okay. And then could you talk about how you're actually going to rollout the Showcase product?
Andrew Florance: Sure. We've been test marketing it over the last three to four weeks. We're first selling it really to our existing customers. And we've met with maybe 60 customer sites, and we've gotten a very positive response, signed a significant number of deals. And we will go live with the product in about two weeks, and we'll be pushing out to the entire sales force and going very aggressively on it. It will be a centerpiece of our ICSC presence, the International Council of Shopping Centers' big spring convention. And we have a number of marketing campaigns around it, and it will be probably the primary priority in sales over the second, third and fourth quarters of this year.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: Okay. And then how are you actually pricing the product?
Andrew Florance: We are pricing it with an algorithm that I couldn't begin to explain on the phone call. What we are doing is we are looking at each client's inventory of listings, both sale and lease. Roughly speaking, we're looking at the value of those listings, and then we're getting discounts for their bulk purchasing of these advertisements on our website. So what we're trying to do there is incentivize our customers to buy ads for all their listings, not to cherry-pick some listings over others. And we're trying to make sure that we aren't charging more to advertise a little less than they're going to earn in commissions. And so we're sort of setting the value relative to the value of the ads on the properties they're trying to move. And so far, the response of this pricing model, which is fairly new and unique, has been very positive. So we've been out there. We've tried it on 60 customers. And they look at it, and they say overall they feel like it's right. And we haven't had a lot of pushback on the price. So, it seems to be working pretty well.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: Got it. Okay. And then just last question, Brian, what was cash from operations in the quarter?
Brian Radecki: Cash from operations, I think it was around $6 million, something like that. EBITDA was $11.5 million.
Jon Maietta - Needham & Company: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.
Andrew Florance: Thanks, Jon.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Wilson with JMP Securities.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Andrew Florance: Hi, Jim.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Let's see. I guess two things. It's a great color on the sales efforts this quarter and the size of firms. Anything you can give color on the geography of success of sales or are those markets you have now fully completed with the most information or have those been your target points or have those been your most successful sales locations or anything else you can give that that would color?
Andrew Florance: And you're referring to Showcase?
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: No, not Showcase, but back to sales piece of new subscribers, the core products during the first quarter.
Andrew Florance: Okay. So, one of the things we were doing in the first quarter was we were again going back to this effort we made to put all of our sales group focusing on the smaller high listing count firms. They really probably concentrated in our weaker market areas. They would not be in Washington, D.C., New York City or Los Angeles. They would be in newer territories. So, a lot of the sales from the quarter came from weaker or mid-level market areas. And you didn't really ask, but I'm going to tell you anyhow, on the Showcase side, one of the unusual aspects of the Showcase sales are some big sales are coming from some of our smallest markets. So, we're seeing some unusually positive selling activity in markets like Omaha and that kind of market.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: I guess maybe then another Showcase question. You gave us the average contract size so far and what you've worked on, but what about average number of listings? How big are these guys in terms of listings that you're signing up?
Andrew Florance: We don't know. Initially, what we're doing is we're focusing only on firms with five or more listings. So, we're not even talking to firms that have less than five listings. I don't have precise numbers, but it appears to vary. It seems to vary from as little as, I've seen some contracts come in at 10 listings, 15 listings on up to a contract that probably came in for 1,000 listings. So, it's a range.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Okay. And it's probably too early to have a terribly meaningful average anyway, I guess?
Andrew Florance: Yes, and you tend to focus on the ones that come in at the bigger number.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Right. Sure. Okay. All right. Good. That's helpful. Thanks.
Andrew Florance: Thank you, Jim. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Neff with William Blair.
Andrew Florance: Hi, John.
John Neff - William Blair: Congratulations on the quarter.
Andrew Florance: Thank you very much.
Brian Radecki: Thanks, John.
John Neff - William Blair: A few questions for you. The 17% decline in selling and marketing, from my numbers, it looks like sales headcount was relatively flat year-over-year. So, why that sharp decline? Is there something negative about that? Is it an indictment of sales productivity or commission payouts or are you cutting back somewhere we should be aware of?
Brian Radecki: Yes, I think I mentioned in my script that we had some yearend marketing campaigns that were going out, multiple direct mail pieces that were going out all through the quarter before the end of the year. So, those kind of dropped off from Q4 to Q1. And then again, we expect an increase there, not just from ICSC, but also the release of Showcase in the second quarter. So, it's more timing and when the marketing and direct mail pieces went out. A lot went out in Q4. Not as much went out in Q1. And we'll expect to see an increase in Q2.
John Neff - William Blair: I meant more year-over-year. So, were there proportionately more of those kinds of marketing --?
Brian Radecki: Yes.
John Neff - William Blair: In the year-ago quarter, first quarter?
Andrew Florance: You also had higher sales training and recruiting costs in the first quarter of '07.
Brian Radecki: Correct. Higher sales training costs in the first quarter of '07 as we were ramping that up. And again, we definitely had a difference in the marketing campaigns between the two years.
Andrew Florance: Now, I think as your seeing, both on the research side and on the sales side, again, first quarter last year we were still full on stepping up the cost structure. So, now you're seeing a lot of efficiencies coming in, and we've talked about a relatively fixed cost structure. But obviously, excluding the one-time gain, you actually saw costs come down quarter-over-quarter. And again, that's because you're not in hiring phase. Those groups are maturing. So, there is actually a lot less in training costs and those types of things.
John Neff - William Blair: Customer usage, how do you measure that?
Andrew Florance: We're looking at how many searches people are doing, whether or not they log on consistently. We look for at least 100 page views before we call you active, 100 requests from a logged-in state. And we look for that in the course of a one-month time period, I believe, or else we don't call you active. And we watch it pretty closely, because it's one of the key metrics we use in compensating our sales people for growing the number of people using the product within their book of business. And we think it's an important predictor of renewal rates. So, people that use our product heavily renew the service. Some people that don't use the product heavily, renew the service too, but generally like them using the service. So, it's a measure of number of searches, number of pages viewed. And right now, the numbers look very good, which is counter to probably general sentiment of a downcycle.
John Neff - William Blair: You gave some numbers. I was wondering if you could repeat what that total user count was at the end of the quarter? But also, could you also describe from a standpoint of pricing scheme with contracts your revenue sensitivity to number of users? In other words, if we were to see more widespread industry layoffs in commercial real estate, more brokers being let go, et cetera, what kind of an impact or sensitivity does that present to your contract value?
Andrew Florance: Yes, so the total subscriber accounts, which the number we gave, is 90,822 currently. So, it's up 2,071 over the preceding quarter. Now, so, we're seeing very strong growth in the number of subscribers with authorized IDs. As people, if a 10-person shop cuts two brokers or three brokers or loses two or three brokers, it really has no impact on the contract values. It has no impact on the revenue side. Where it becomes more material is when somebody with five goes down to one. Those people are going to be looking for a discount. And that's why I sort of mentioned earlier in the call and I have mentioned in previous calls is that's where you see a little bit more a friction on the renewal rate are those folks getting much smaller. The folks who are mid-sized firms or big firms who are moving up and down slightly generally does not impact our revenue base. But right now the usage numbers and the subscriber growth is what you would normally associate with a strong market, not a weak market.
John Neff - William Blair: That's helpful. And then I was just a little confused when you said the average contract size for Showcase was $11,400.
Andrew Florance: Annually.
John Neff - William Blair: Annually. Okay. So I'm just confused. My impression was that this was a per group of listing -- at per X number of listings per month kind of an offering.
Andrew Florance: What it is --
John Neff - William Blair: We get something more of a subscription kind of a thing.
Andrew Florance: It's much more of a subscription service, and many people are looking at this as a multi-year subscription. So what we're doing is we're going to a brokerage firm, and we have good intelligence and information as to what their volume and content of listings typically looks like. We apparently have developed a formula that seems to resonate with them as a fair way to price marketing their entire basket of listings, based upon their historical activity we lock in a fixed rate, which will stay in place for the term of the contract regardless whether or not their listing count goes up or down. So if their listing count goes down, they're probably generating lot of commissions, and if the listing count goes up, they're going to be generating commissions in the future, hopefully. But it's a fixed number based upon their historical activity. And, again, we seem to have hit on something here because we have a short sale cycle on this product, it appears, and we have a high close rate --
Brian Radecki: John, it's much more similar to our subscription-based business in total. So it's very similar to kind of how we've been selling things in the past.
John Neff - William Blair: And if that --
Andrew Florance: We know you don't like the sort of annuity subscription revenue streams.
John Neff - William Blair: Yes. We hate that, but it's an interesting point because I guess there was some concern previously to what extent -- how do you avoid cannibalization with other products? Is it even an issue if this is the average contract size?
Andrew Florance: I think that was a concern that we had 12 months ago or 18 months ago as we first began looking at the product. And given the average contract size we're looking at right now, it becomes less of a concern because the contract values almost have a comparative relationship to the information contracts. The marketing contracts are looking like information contracts. But also if you look in our Scottish property network company, they actually do something where they have a Showcase like product and they have an information service, and I think something like 80% of their listing content is out for the public to see, yet they still have very strong subscriptions for information for kind of (inaudible) looking to get the extra 20% of the listings that aren't publicly disclosed. And then when I look at the relative size of Glasgow and Edinburgh compared to the various US markets and I look at the revenue stream we're deriving from that Scottish property network, it's actually favorable. So I think that's a little empirical experience that we can look at on a potential cannibalization, it doesn't look like a concern.
John Neff - William Blair: All right. I can get back in the queue. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned some of the smaller customers who are undergoing a loss of confidence over the state of the industry, and if I heard you right, that may have contributed to the slight drop in the retention rate. Just wondering if you could elaborate a little on the increase in bad debt and the cause of that which might suggest more than just concern on the part of customers?
Andrew Florance: Sure. So let's segment that appropriately. I would say that, you look at CB Richard Ellis's reported revenue growth and earnings growth and Richard Elli's sales reported revenue growth, earnings growth, and there's no sign of any issues that I see as I look at that. And so if you have a delay in a buying cycle from our mid-size to larger firms, it is more related to them spending too much time reading the FT or The Wall Street Journal and the bad news, not the actual reality in their business. When I talk about loss of confidence, that would not apply to the one, two, three-person brokerage firm in California, Phoenix, or Southern Florida. Some of them are in bad straits. It's actually real there. Leasing volume in some markets in California not San Francisco, but say Orange County, leasing volume is down sharply. And so some of the small firms are going bankrupt, which would be a loss of confidence. So we're seeing bad debt in some of those guys. And that's what you're looking at in that cancellation rate being a little higher in this quarter. And when you look at those guys anecdotally, what you see is some people who entered the marketplace. Generally I'm seeing people that entered the marketplace in the last one to three years, like went out on their own from some bigger firm and now they're going back into a bigger firm or going into something different.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That's very helpful. And you would explain the slight international sequential drop in revenues, but the international EBITDA was down quite a bit more. Was that primarily due to the heavy investment upfront, or were there any other factors at work there?
Andrew Florance: We had a one-time transaction in the fourth quarter that probably should be written up in the real estate textbooks for the all-time most lucrative lease termination deal in the history of real estate globally. So we were paid $800 per square foot to terminate a 10,000 square foot lease in London early in the fourth quarter and took a large one-time gain, so what you're seeing is just the elimination of that one-time gain. And the UK is probably six months behind the US in sort of filling out the geographic coverage, and so they are a little bit behind the US in the margin expansion phase of the business.
Brian Radecki: I think we discussed that the international is running a few quarters behind, and that's why, obviously, we're targeting the 30% in the US and then breakeven by the end of the year internationally.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: All right. And then, lastly, could you provide some color on the legal expense related to the competitors, what effect that had on the quarterly numbers and then whether that should trend down significantly from here and thanks?
Brian Radecki: We haven't disclosed that amount. Obviously, if you take a look at the G&A line, it's not up significantly quarter-over-quarter. So I believe it was $9.743 in Q4 and $9.805 in Q1. So it's not a significant change. I don't think it's anything that we're going to discuss.
Andrew Florance: And our legal and anti-piracy team is actually having significant success with out-of-court settlements with smaller password stealers so that they're probably actually almost operating as a profit center, which is highly unusual in a general counsel's office.
Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Brian Radecki: Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Christopher Mammone with Deutsche Bank.
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Sitting in for Chris. Just a housekeeping question first. The $300,000 lease termination charge that you mentioned, is that included in the guidance for second quarter?
Brian Radecki: Yes, it is. It is included in the second quarter guidance.
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. And the other question, with respect to the strong subscriber growth that you saw this quarter, would you characterize that as purely ramp up on the sales force productivity, or do you think that you are seeing some early success in the 80 new markets that you have in the US now?
Andrew Florance: I'll sort of go between those two options, and I'll say that it's probably the maturation of the sales force. We had a lot of newer sales people now they are with us for six months, nine months, and they're beginning to become productive. And this has probably been a somewhat challenging exercise for our sales force because they are pursuing strategic initiatives, as opposed to the maximum revenue initiative. So they're getting a lot of high subscriber growth that will pay off over the next several quarters to come. And I think it's a mix, these subscribers are coming from both older and new markets, probably more of the mid-aged markets is the biggest driver.
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And one last question. Did I hear you correct that you said you might be starting to see revenues from Showcase in the third quarter?
Brian Radecki: I would expect minor revenues from Showcase in the third quarter. I would believe that most of the revenues will show up in the fourth quarter. As Andy mentioned, there will be some free trial periods for a few months so we would expect to start to see Q4 seeing revenue come in from that. We'll obviously discuss that more on calls to come.
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Okay, but is that included in your annual revenue growth guidance?
Brian Radecki: Yes, it is.
Christopher Mammone - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you.
Brian Radecki: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated.
Andrew Florance: Hey, Brett.
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated: Good morning. How are you?
Andrew Florance: Doing fine and a couple of technical difficulties this morning.
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated: Okay, I had two quick questions. Number one, I wanted to make sure I understood how the pricing on your product works generally. I know you described it a little bit, but I want to make sure that I understand it. Is it that, if a substantial decline in the number of people at a brokerage has to occur in order for repricing to occur. But isn't that also limited by the length of contract? Like that issue wouldn't even come up if it were an annual contract until renewal; is that right?
Andrew Florance: You've got that correct.
Brian Radecki: That's correct, Brett.
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated: Okay. So that's one thing. And then the second thing is can you talk just a little bit about the exposure of your business generally to weakness in sales versus weakness in leasing in the commercial market?
Andrew Florance: Sure. Our property professional business, which is the largest component of our business, is not very exposed to the sales marketplace. I mean, I think it's got very light exposure. Our commercial multiple listing service, which generates probably around $1 million a year, or half a percentage point of our revenue, would be exposed to a sales downturn. So if volumes came down, sales came down, our sales in that product, which again was half a percentage point of our revenue, would have a lot of exposure. And I see some softness in that product. So that product was growing steadily up until the fourth quarter, and then it began to level and that's a low-end product that we set up to be more competitive with like LoopNet. Our comps product is -- from the people that have worked with the product for 25 years is generally not very cyclical, because as volumes in the sales side go down or problems occur or bankruptcies occur, the banks themselves need the product more in order to try to understand their asset exposure and what's going on in their loan-to-asset ratios. So we don't, the more cowboy brokers who are riding the upward trend are not the guys who are doing that, not the men and women who are doing a lot of careful analysis with our comps product. It's the appraisers and valuation folks that do more work with our comps product, and they remain employed when things get dicey.
Brett Huff - Stephens Incorporated: Okay. Those are the only two questions I had. Thanks for your time.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?
Andrew Florance: Yes. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call. I think we had a great quarter, and I'm sorry that we had to make you wait ten minutes to hear about the good news. Thank you very much.
