===== 2025 Q2  (2025-05-01 08:00:00) =====
Eric Guter: [Abrupt Start] …operating margin, EBITDA, the effective tax rate and ROCE, either on a total company or segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures refer to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financials can be found on our investor website in the relevant earnings release section. Now I'll turn the call over to Eduardo.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, this is Eduardo Menezes. Thank you for joining us today. Please turn to Slide 3. Let me begin by sharing a few thoughts from my first three months as Air Products, CEO. I talked with our employees, visited several sites and met with many of our largest customers and partners. I can say Air Products has a solid core industrial gas business with significant upside if we stay within our traditional business model. Decades ago, Air Products pioneered the on-site business model. Today, approximately 50% of the company sales are on-site with long-term take-or-pay contracts, the highest percentage in the industry. Air Products has also built density in its merchant business, helping customers be more efficient and sustainable. We became the leading supplier of hydrogen, operating hydrogen pipeline networks around the world, including the world's largest at the U.S. Gulf Coast. We have also became a leading supplier of high period gases for the electronics industry. These are clearly strengths to build upon. However, over the past few years Air Products moved away from its core business in search of growth. The company pivoted to investments in coal gasification, and then in clean energy. We deployed capital to complex higher risk projects with first of a kind technologies and more importantly without committed offtake agreements in place. In doing so, Air Products moved away from its successful model, while significantly increasing its financial leverage and headcount to support these projects. The company grew by almost 7,000 employees since 2018, to execute the capital plan. This had a negative impact on both cost and execution quality, leading to significant project delays. All of this leads to the importance of refocusing our products on its core business and core capabilities. Please turn to Slide 4, and let me talk about where the business stands today. You can think about Air Products business in three categories. First, we have the strong core industrial gas business. This includes the on-site projects with take-or-pay agreements, regional merchant business and a portfolio of high quality minority owned joint ventures. The business has about $12 billion in sales and operating margin of 24%. I'm confident we can improve margins and unlock significant value through disciplined cost, productivity, pricing and operational excellence. This is the largest opportunity we have considering the $35 billion in capital we have invested in the base business. In summary, Air Products can grow strongly and profitably in traditional industrial gases. And yes, we can also participate in clean energy opportunities as long as they align with the traditional industrial gases model where customers take the volume list. Second, we have the two large projects in Saudi Arabia and Louisiana. We believe these projects are set up to be the lowest cost producer of green and blue ammonia for several decades. To be clear, Air Products is an industrial gases company and does not intend to be a retail marketer of ammonia. As a progress report, I can say that the Saudi Green project is progressing well. Our 4 gigawatt solar and wind power generation, will be concluded by mid-2026, and we will start commissioning electrolyzers and ammonia production after that. As you were informed before, we successfully limited our spend on this project through partnership and project financing. We expect product availability in 2027. Regarding the Louisiana project, we are actively working to derisk it, by focusing on the industrial gases portion of the project. We announced ongoing discussions to divest the carbon sequestration and the ammonia production elements of this project. The earliest startup of this facility is 2028 or 2029, pending the derisking strategy. To make it clear, Air Products will only move forward with this project when we have firm offtake agreements for hydrogen and nitrogen. Third, we also have the underperforming projects with CapEx totaling about $5 billion. These are first of a kind energy transition projects, with substantial cost overruns. In some instances, these underperforming projects were designed to produce additional volumes for non-contracted pipeline sales, and for the hydrogen mobility market, which is being delayed or reduced. I will provide additional comments on these underperforming projects in a few minutes. Please turn to Slide 5. Air Products will get back to basics. First, we will return to excellence in execution in our core business. We can invest about $1.5 billion per year in core industrial gas projects going forward. Our focus will be on opportunities that meet our high return thresholds, with high quality customers and contracted take-or-pay offtake. And we will work to expand our margins through operational excellence, productivity and by rightsizing the organization, as we return to a normal level of CapEx spending. Focused on the second column of this slide, we remain cautiously optimistic about both the green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia and the Blue Hydrogen facility in Louisiana. In Saudi Arabia in the near term, we will focus on completing construction and selling clean ammonia FOB Saudi Arabia, until hydrogen regulations fully develop, and we will delay investment in downstream facilities in Europe, until specific regulatory frameworks are clear for each country, and we have firm customer commitments. As you all know, the previously announced agreement for green hydrogen supply in Europe, is scheduled to start in 2030. We expect clarity regarding the development of this project, no later than 2027. For Louisiana, we plan to concentrate on the hydrogen and nitrogen production, and continue discussions to derisk the carbon sequestration ammonia production activities. There will be no new spending commitments on this project, while we pursue the derisking strategy. Lastly, we're moving forward with the underperforming projects, given our commercial obligations and project status. Though they are not expected to materially contribute to operating cost. We anticipate these projects will provide positive cash flow, which will allow us to recover on an undiscounted basis our cash investment over the life of the projects. We have roughly $2 billion remaining to be spent on these projects from 2026 to 2028. Our goal will be to maximize profitability for commercial negotiations, operational improvements and productivity. Turn to Slide 6. We have begun the process of getting back to basics. We canceled three significant U.S. projects in February, and we are taking a more prudent approach to the Louisiana project. Additionally, we are also working to address the underperforming projects, which do not currently meet our expectations. For the previously announced Net Zero hydrogen project in Edmonton, total cost is now expected to be $3.3 billion with on stream between late 2027 and early 2028. On the next two slides, I will detail how we will bring down both our capital expenditure and headcount in the coming years. On Slide 7, you can see that once we complete the projects in Saudi Arabia and Louisiana, as well as the underperforming projects, our capital expenditure will level at roughly $2.5 billion per year, which can sustain both our future growth and ongoing maintenance. Now please turn to Slide 8. Part of our productivity improvement will come from rightsizing our headcount to the levels we had before, we started the large wave of projects discussed in this presentation. Air Products total headcount increased from approximately 16,000 to 23,000 employees since 2018. 1,300 reductions have already been identified and are in process. This is in addition to the approximately 500 related to the LNG divestiture. We intend to identify another 2,500 to 3,000 positions, which will be eliminated between 2026 and 2028, as we finalize the large projects with the objective of reaching an unemployment level similar to 2018 adjusted for employee growth to support new assets. Let's turn to Slide 9, and talk about our roadmap for improvement in the coming years. For 2025, we expect our base business to deliver around $12 per share of EPS, double-digit ROCE and over 20% adjusted operating margin. We strongly believe we can do better, so we will look to maximize profitability from the base business, to drive results in the coming years. We will manage our cash flow to allow dividend increases, new projects and in time reduce our debt and buyback shares. As we improve our operating margin through productivity, and address challenges in certain projects, we expect these key operating metrics to improve despite the burden of the underperforming projects. We anticipate that during the 2026 to 2029 period, we can achieve high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, adjusted operating margin in the high 20s, and adjusted ROCE in the low to mid-teens. We also expect our aggregated net cash flow, to improve to neutral during this period. As you can see in the far right column, once the Saudi Arabia and Louisiana projects begin contributing, we expect to unlock significant potential, achieving roughly 30% adjusted operating margin, mid to high-teens, adjusted ROCE and double-digit adjusted EPS growth by 2030, and beyond. Our objective is that at full contribution, these projects will allow us to achieve greater than 10% compounded EPS growth, versus 2025 by 2031 or 2032. The Air Products team recognizes the importance of transparent communications, with our investors. Going forward, we will A, focus 100% on our core industrial gas business, B, be disciplined with capital and C, build a culture that prioritizes productivity and continues improvement. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Air Products employees, for the way they received me during the last three months, and for their support to refocus the company in our traditional business model, despite difficult changes we'll need to go through. Now I'll turn it over to Melissa, to go through our financial results. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Eduardo, and good morning everyone. As a reminder on this call, we will be speaking about our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Before we do, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the $2.3 billion after tax charge taken in the second quarter. This charge included the project cancellation we previously announced, cost reduction measures and executive separation costs. We will now turn to Slide number 11, to review our financial results. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.69, or below our previous guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 primarily due to changes in cost estimate on a sale of equipment project in the U.S. and lower than forecasted helium contribution. Compared to last year, sales volume was down 3%, with 2% driven by the LNG business divestment, while weaker merchant primarily helium was largely offset by favorable on-site volumes across the region. Total company price was up 1%, which equates to a 3% improvement for the merchant business, driven by continued non-helium pricing strength in the Americas and Europe. Adjusted operating income decreased 9%, mainly due to the LNG divestiture and unfavorable helium impact. Additionally, we saw higher costs from driven by Americas maintenance and fixed cost inflation, which was partially offset by strong productivity actions across the company. Operating margin was down 210 basis points, with approximately 100 basis points driven by higher energy pass through. Now please turn to the Slide number 12, for the details of the second quarter earnings per share. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.69, decreased $0.16 from prior year. The divestment of the LNG business accounted for $0.12 of headwind and currency was unbearable $0.04. Our base, which includes volume, price and cost was down $0.07. Other than LNG, volume was relatively flat, as a lower helium was largely offset by favorable on-site volumes. Price was positive $0.04 driven by improvements in the Americas and Europe. Costs were $0.11 unfavorable, primarily due to fixed cost inflation and higher maintenance in Americas, partially offset by favorable cost productivity across the company. Equity affiliate income was better in Europe, but partially offset by lower contribution in America. Now please turn to Slide number 13, I would like to provide an update on our FY '25 full year guidance. Since our last earnings call, we have canceled several large projects and observed volatility in the macroeconomic conditions. As we look at the guidance year-on-year, the divestiture of LNG will continue to drive a 4% decrease relative to the prior year. The large project cancellation will be a 3% headwind, resulting from lower operating income and reduced capitalized interest. We anticipate base business growth of 2% to 5% for the year, despite the 5% headwind in helium, resulting in a fiscal 2025 full year adjusted earnings per share, to be in the range of $11.85 to $12.15. Please note the potential economic impact of global tariffs, is not in our guidance. While the industrial gas business is primarily a local business and very resilient, it is difficult to determine at this time, if there will be broader macroeconomic impacts from tariffs, or events that may impact our customers. We expect our third quarter adjusted earnings per share be in the range of $2.90 to $3, and our full year capital expenditure to be approximately $5 million. We've included additional details on the segment results in the Appendix section. Now we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning and thanks for taking my question and welcome to Air Products. So I had a question for you on the underperforming projects where you highlighted that there's no operating income contribution. I guess maybe a couple of things on that. First, how should we think about the EBITDA contribution just because, obviously, early on, there's going to be a lot of D&A just given the size and scale of these projects. And then I guess, also tied to that, the Alberta project looks like it's ballooned up almost three times what I think the original plan was. I guess, can you help us to understand what's going on there, and what looks to be a reasonable delay in that project as well? Thanks very much.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you John, for the question. Yes, let's start with the contribution from the projects in terms of EBITDA. As we're saying here, we expect to basically recover our capital on an undiscounted basis, which means that we expect to be able to get on average our depreciation for this project. So of course, this is not what we expect to have, but that's what the situation is. Considering the tremendous increase that we have in capital, which is part of your second question. So regarding Alberta, I would say that of course, we had some self-inflicted issues. And when you have that in a construction environment that is, so unforgivable as Alberta, you pay a steep price. So when you have a project that gets out of sequence, and you start losing windows in terms of weather, and how to execute the project. And then you have very low productivity from contractors that, are very expensive to start with. So you get on this spiral and then the project gets delayed, we have capitalized interest, in which case, in the case of Air Products is included in the cost of these projects. So what happened here, basically, this didn't happen in the last 90 days, as you can imagine. At the end of last year, the company basically understood that we had a problem. We hired a third-party to look at the project to give us some opinions about, how we're doing on that. And as a result of that and some of the reviews that I was able to do here, we basically took some actions on replacing project management teams, replace contractors. And then we resequenced the job and that resulted on this estimate for cost, and schedule that we are presenting today. Again, of course, this is not exactly what we would like to have, but we have a commitment to be transparent with the shareholders, and this is where we are today.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color on that. And then maybe just a follow-up. In your introductory remarks, you spoke about some of the past strategic decisions, including the pivot to gasification. You've got - it seems like $0.40 to $0.50 worth of big gasification projects out there in terms of EPS contribution. I guess can you speak to your comfort with those projects? Are they delivering kind of as you would expect if you were starting from scratch. And I guess can you speak to the resiliency that you would expect from those if we have some sort of a downturn, especially given some of the issues going on between the U.S. and China?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. Yes, it's another tough subject. We have three gasification projects in China where we operate the coal gasifiers and the reality is, if you look at our numbers from '23 and '24, the EPS contribution, the combined EPS contribution of these three projects was close to zero. So it's not exactly the $0.40 you you're mentioning here, before you ask, I know there were a lot of discussions about the Lu'an project when that started. The Lu'an project is probably the best of the 3 projects we have there. The main issues we have on the other two projects. So we have our team working on that, trying to understand how we can optimize these assets, but if you look historically on the performance of the Asian segment for Air Products, you see some deterioration coming from the last few years. And I would say that most of this deterioration came from these gasification projects. And in terms of the tensions between China and the U.S. At this point, we don't see a lot in the ground. Our business is really a local business. I think it's understood locally, by the government and the customers as a local business. And again, these other two projects that we have, that we have more problems there. They are not government entities. They are private-owned companies that make methanol, or ammonia from syngas from coal gasification?
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. In your remarks, Eduardo about descoping in Louisiana, I was just wondering if 1 potential scenario would be to just focus on hydrogen. You mentioned you have the largest pipeline network in the Gulf Coast. Why pursue ammonia at all, drop the ammonia reactor, drop the deepwater port and just focus on hydrogen and reduce the CapEx. Is that a scenario that you would consider?
Eduardo Menezes: That's exactly the scenario we are trying to explain. We're talking about not only having someone else executing the ammonia loop, and only in the ammonia loop, but also another company or the same company taking care of the CO2 sequestration, which is not a core business for us. So the objective, Steve, from the total cost of this project, let's say, it's $8 billion with the full scope. Our objective is to bring the total CapEx down to a range of $5 billion to $6 billion with a firm offtake agreement, for the hydrogen in nitrogen. That's the objective we have given ourselves until the end of the year, to work on these options. And I'm relatively optimistic on that. I think we have a good location. We have probably the best CO2 part of the space in the region. So I think, we have the right components and our total CapEx, is in line or even a little better than other products that were announced in the region, when you adjust for the size of the project.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you for that. With a question about NEOM is $600 a ton, a reasonable estimate for the green ammonia that you will be taking possession, from the joint venture? And curious to hear your view on the value proposition, to potential customers at $600 a ton?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. As you can imagine, we cannot talk about specific numbers on our agreements. I can tell you that from the outside, I was very concerned with this project, because we have this long-term take-or-pay commitment to buy the entire production of ammonia. I have seen several reports from sell-side analysts with estimates of the price. I can tell you that I was positively surprised with the numbers that I found and they are in the lower part of the range, of the estimates that I've seen before. I would say that in addition to that, the one positive point for our NEOM project is that since we own the power generation, in both solar and wind, and there is no other variable cost, our price that we're going to have from the joint venture, is going to be basically fixed for the life of the - we have a small adjustment for O&M, but that would be it. So I think in the long-term, it's a very favorable outlook for us in the market. In the short-term, '27 to basically 2030 until the regulations in Europe, are more well developed. We're going to have a little less contribution, but I'm relatively optimistic that the project will contribute to us starting in - when we start up the plant in 2027.
Steve Byrne: Very good. Thank you.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is going to come from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Eduardo, first on the headcount reduction, what's the initial savings from the first tranche of roughly 1,800 people being let go? And what's the cadence of those savings?
Eduardo Menezes: We started this process before. So even in '23, '24. So I'll let Melissa explain the numbers, but we are very advanced on the '23, '24, and I think we are already close to 50% or more than that on the new reductions of 800 people. Melissa, do you have additional comments on that.
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure. Yes. Thank you, Eduardo. So since FY '23, we've taken actions on around 2,400 individuals. That's about 10% of the organization. This will largely be complete the FY '23 and '24 actions by the end of this fiscal year, and we'll see the FY '25 actions continue through FY '26. We should see about $25 million in savings for this fiscal year associated to the '25 actions, and the remaining will be seen in '26. We're looking for a run rate of around $100 million for the FY '25 actions.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Just on Alberta, again, in six months' time, the project has basically doubled in cost and been pushed out by two years. So when - I'm not clear when the company became aware of this? And what's been reaction of your customer to this delay?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. I hope you understand that. I'm here for 90 days, and I cannot give you that information precisely. It's something that we're probably going to need to take a look, and I can make some comments in private to you, but it's definitely not something that I can comment here.
David Begleiter: Understood, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Can you talk about what the point of the remaining Louisiana project is for Air Products? That is how much hydrogen you need, and why you need it, and why you want to go forward with that part of the project?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes, Jeff, if I understand your question, the total project, if you go back and look at the numbers, if I'm not wrong, it's something like 750 million cubic feet a day of hydrogen and as you know, we announced two ammonia trains. And so the ammonia production is taking about 75% to 80% of the - or maybe more than 80% to 85% of the total hydrogen production. So the balance that we have is really the equivalent of one SMR, right, on what size SMR so that's where we have today in the scope. And as you know, the size of our - I'm sorry, as you know, the size of our system, this is relatively a small part of our total production in the Gulf Coast, and we believe we can absorb that in our normal business.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you for that. And for Melissa, if the cost savings from the employee reductions are something like $100 million going forward. Does that mean that these employees or the cost of these employees were mainly capitalized? And so the income statement effects of getting to a more normal employee level are smaller?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Great question, Jeff. So the amount that I'm giving you the $100 million associated to the FY '25 program, that's a P&L impact. So there are, in fact, engineers that are capitalized on top of that $100 million of savings. Around $40 million from an engineering resources impact that you don't see slow down to the bottom line. But obviously, we'll have a reduction in the capital cost.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Cunningham from Citi.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning and welcome. Eduardo. For NEOM, you're now delaying the downstream investment until you get regulatory clarity - what does that mean for the agreement with Total? And who are the logical customers for that green ammonia and just your general view on the relative premium you would get paid there?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. Our agreement for green hydrogen in Europe, the agreement that we announced a few months ago, and they were making reference to is really for 2030, right? And the agreement, as you know, the customer has several refineries across Europe. And as part of the agreement, what we are basically doing today is engineering work and permitting work and trying to wait to see how each country will transpose the EU regulations. So together, we can decide which refinery would make more sense for us to supply the green hydrogen. So this is the work we're going to be doing between now and 2027, I would say. And by 2027, we hope to have a definition, we'll be able to understand exactly, the regulations and what makes sense for both Air Products and the customer in terms of installing this hydrogen, this ammonia associates for hydrogen production. In terms of what we do starting 2027, it's part of what I have been working on. We hope to be able to announce firm plans on how we're going to commercialize this ammonia. Again, FOB, Saudi Arabia, we don't intend to be long-term marketers of ammonia to be in the ammonia business. So we're looking - working with potential partners, and I hope to be able to have something firm that I can share with you all, by the end of 2026. I'm sorry, by the end of 2025.
Patrick Cunningham: Understood. Very helpful. And I'm curious as you go and meet with leaders in the different countries. What's your sense for the opportunity on productivity and price optimization for the core business? How meaningful will those levers be? And where do you see the biggest opportunities on price?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. I would say that coming from the outside, going back in time, I tell people that I used to come - town 20, 25 years ago to work in projects and talking to business development people to engineering people. And hopefully, they were not very different from what I was used with. So I wasn't expecting very different cultures, when I came here. I don't know exactly what to expect on the operating side of the day-to-day. But I'm pleasantly surprised. I think the local business performs well. I think they have a lot of attention to the detail. They have been working very hard on price, and productivity for the last few years. It doesn't mean it's perfect. There is always an opportunity. You see that we talk about our base business today, running at 24% operating profit margin. And by the way, you won't see any reference to EBITDA in any of our presentations going forward. So we're going to look at really the operating profit from our regions, keep the equity affiliates outside of that, although we have a fantastic business on some of these joint ventures, but we're going to focus on our business. And I don't think there is any reason for us, to not have the same level of performance of the best-in-class players here. So we're going to work on that. I believe there is an opportunity for us to raise our operating margins to the level of 30%, as we have in the roadmap slide. And it's basically blocking and tackling and reviewing every business, paying attention on every detail, and I think the business already had that DNA, and I'm just trying to expedite that and make sure that everyone behaves, like a business owner and they own their own P&Ls, and we can accomplish this increase in operating profit margin. Any other questions?
Operator: And our next question is coming from Mike Leithead from Barclays.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning. First question, I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on how the team works through deciding which projects should be canceled versus which projects were deemed underperforming yet you go forward, such as why the green hydrogen project in Arizona moves forward versus, say, the green hydrogen project in New York does not?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. It's just a cash flow decision. So you have two factors, right? One, any commercial commitments that you have with customers. We take that very seriously. So we need to finish any contractual commitment that we have and then if you have the freedom of making a decision like that, then you just look at your cash flow, look at what you need to spend to finish the project from where you are. And what the cash flow will be after the discount cash flow will be, after you start the plant. So in the case of Arizona, we are basically 90% done or 95% of the CapEx was already spent, or committed. So it was not - the best thing for the shareholders was to finish the project and get whatever cash flow will get out of this project, right? In the case of Masina in New York, we were in the beginning of the project, we still had to spend another $400 million to finish. And based on the perspectives that you have for the mobility market, it didn't make sense for us to continue on a cash basis.
Mike Leithead: Great. That's super helpful. And then second, I just was hoping you could talk more about the cash flow progression you expect over the next 1 to 2 years. I guess when you talk about net cash flow, is that after funding the dividend? And how do you think about when is appropriate to begin share repurchases as you've alluded to in the slides?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. I think we are talking about being neutral, including everything, but I'll let Melissa give you more details. Go ahead, Melissa.
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure. Thanks, Eduardo. So when we look at cash flow positive, we believe we can be cash flow positive as early as next year. This obviously is, of course, dependent on our WIP curves for the execution of our projects, and several other factors. But as of right now, we are projecting to be cash flow positive next year. Additionally, we are forecasting to be net cash flow positive through 2028 and then acceleratingly significant positive thereafter. When I think about share repurchase obviously, I take into consideration a number of things. We need to think about and assess our balance sheet. We need to delever as we decrease our capital spend. But of course, part of that plan as our balance sheet does get into a position to do so and economically, we can, we will then put in our share buyback program at that point in time.
Mike Leithead: Great, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Helium for you guys has been a pretty volatile earnings contributor over the last five years, kind of ran up post the war and then rolled off hard. And it as kind of like a commodity on supply/demand to some degree. So can you help size the earnings contribution from helium today? And basically, how you see that contribution progressing kind of out through your '26 to '29 period?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes, Duffy, it's - helium is a different product. As you know, we have suppliers and customers and it's a more cyclical business, and it became even more cyclical with the - when the BLM basically ended the program, and they were basically the balance of the volume and that went away. Air Products, we took measures to protect ourselves. So we have this big cabin that we commissioned in Texas, and we use that to basically absorb the cyclicality volumes, right? We don't have hidden as a segment in our numbers. So I have a very difficult time to give you more specific numbers on that. But I can tell you that compared to the year's pre-COVID, when we had the market shortage and the prices went up. I think the team at Air Products did a good - very good job pushing taking advantage of that. They really increased the operating profit very significantly. And now that the market is long, because of all the Russian project - product that you see coming in Asia, we have been managing that, using our cabin. And although the numbers year-over-year, they are negative for us, as Melissa said, was a very significant impact. And as you know, Air Products is a very large - much larger percentage of their sales given than their larger competitors. But today, our operating income from helium, is still significantly higher than it was in the years pre-COVID. So it went up very significantly. It's coming down, but it's still better than, let's say, the period between '15 and '18. We expect that for '26 and '27 that we'll continue to see some headwinds in price. We have more volume because of our cabin. So we expect to manage that and reduce these headwinds as much as we can. But other than this information that Melissa was able to provide for this year, I'm afraid that we cannot disclose more than that.
Duffy Fischer: Fair enough. And then I just wanted to go back, if I could to NEOM just to understand - so in the early years before you have the offtake agreement, let's say, in 2030 and hopefully some other committed by then, when you're selling just the ammonia. Your assumption is that your offtake price for the product will be meaningfully lower than what you'll be able to sell it at. So you'll be able to generate significant free positive cash flow and EBITDA from the asset or from the offtake agreement?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. I don't know your definition of meaningfully, but it will be -- our forecast is that we'll be able, starting 2027 to be positive and to increase that number as the years go by. We were trying to be cautious here on what we can do. We are still negotiating a lot of these offtake agreements. And - but our expectation is that we're going to be, let's say, we're going to be starting to be slightly positive in 2017 and increase from there. Again, we need to do that because as you can imagine, if we have a very favorable price for the ammonia as I explained, it means that the joint venture doesn't have a very high return. So we need to get some margin to basically remunerate our shareholders, for the investment that we made at the joint venture.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. Thank you guys.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is going to come from Josh Spector at UBS. Please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi good morning. First, a quick follow-up for Melissa. Just in answer to Mike's comments around free cash flow. Can you just confirm your '26 comments? Is that positive free cash flow after the dividend or before the dividend?
Melissa Schaeffer: So that's positive free cash flow after the dividend.
Josh Spector: Perfect. Thanks. And then for Eduardo, I wanted to ask around your general approach to guidance here. So obviously, Air Products versus peers has had a bit of a different approach in terms of what macro assumptions are baked in. So as you look at what's here for 2025, the next couple of quarters, what's your assumptions baked in on a macro perspective and then more medium term, when you say high single-digit EPS growth, how much of that, again, Air Products and your control cost savings, et cetera, projects versus macro assumptions? Thanks.
Eduardo Menezes: Well, I would say that we expect not a lot of help going forward from the economy for the next two quarters. The currency, we expect to be about where we are today. The tariff issue, as Melissa said, is a little bit complicated now. We don't have a lot of trade in our day-to-day business. The main issue here is on the capital side. And as you can imagine, for our projects, when we don't buy things off the shelf. We basically have to order equipment and modules and that kind of stuff. And they normally take six months to 18 months, to be manufactured by our suppliers. And I have to say that it's a very difficult environment to predict right now, considering that you only pay the tariffs once you -- the equipment is imported. So we are having - as everyone else, a little difficult trying to forecast what you do in our projects, and going back to our customers that we are in active negotiations, and presenting alternatives and trying to share the risk somehow. But this is affecting much more our projects, our business development and our day-to-day business.
Josh Spector: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. Eduardo, you talked about growth CapEx of $1.5 billion a year on the core industrial gas business. I'm just curious, is that kind of just a placeholder, and the actual spend is going to depend on the number of available projects that, you guys find to meet return metrics. Maybe if you could talk just a little bit more about your approach to determining, what projects you're going to pursue and what you'll pass on?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes, of course. It's just an estimate based on what we have been doing, for the last few years. And the $1.5 billion, is more like what we envision for 2029, 2030. So if you look at this slide, you're going to see that for the next few years, we're going to have a little less than that. That's our expectation. But again, two things we need to have first. We need to be able to fit that in our capital allocation principle, which is being net cash neutral, including dividends, as Melissa said, from '26 to '28. And secondly, they need to satisfy our return expectations, right? I worked in this business for a long time, and I can tell you that the most difficult thing when you talk about new projects to say no, right? It's very easy to say yes, but you have to basically raise the - to be very firm about your hurdle rates, about the returns and expectations. And if you - the project can deliver that, that's great. If the project cannot deliver that after you stress all the assumptions then you need to pass. And that will be the philosophy.
Mike Harrison: All right. Thank you for that. And then just related to the uncertainty around tariffs, a lot of companies that we talk to are saying that they're seeing some slowing in manufacturing activity and pauses in decision-making. I'm just curious, your merchant [indiscernible] business probably gives you some pretty real-timeline of sight into what's going on with your manufacturing customers. Can you talk a little bit about what you've been seeing in the March and April time frame across your three key regions, from a merchant demand perspective? Thank you.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you, Mike. Yes, I'm asking the same question. It's been a little difficult to get a good answer on that. In fact, I think we had like a slight uptick in manufacturing before the tariffs came online because people are trying to create inventory or something else. And now I expect that to be a little negative. Really, the countries that we are more concerned that are being more affected are U.S. and China. And at this point, it's very hard for me to give you a good estimate of what's going on there.
Operator: And our next question is going to come from Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you so much. Just want to turn back to your commentary about Alberta and Rotterdam, understanding some of the commentary on the underperformance and the cost overruns. But - is this - given you still have some decent customers associated with those projects, is this commentary about those specific projects and how they were managed? Or is it more of a larger indictment on your view of blue hydrogen and how that fits into your intermediate to long-term strategy? Thank you.
Eduardo Menezes: No, I would say that our contracts and our customers, they have been as expected. As I said quickly during the remarks, some of these projects, they even have -- they had some additional volume that we need to place with other customers. We still believe we can do that. That's been positive. We have some other projects like in Alberta that we have a liquid hydrogen plant associated with the project that, was supposed to produce liquid hydrogen for the local market, for the mobility local market. That part of the project on the, liquefy is basically done. And so we're going to go ahead with that because it's going to be there, but we expect a very slow development on that. So the overall, let's say, underperformance of the projects related to our expected financials, are basically related to the overrun in CapEx, and to some additional volumes for the mobility market. Everything else, I think it's - we expect to perform as expected in the project.
Chris Parkinson: Got it. And just a quick - to dive into a little bit more details on your comment about 2026 free cash flow post the dividend you both just mentioned this, but just really hit the nail me on this, what further assumptions would we need to make in terms of like cash flow conversion of what's specifically in your control to reach those levels and I apologize I kind of just got like 10 questions on it. So I just want to be absolutely certain that we have this correct?
Eduardo Menezes: Yes. At the end of the day, you look at our projects, our CapEx and our cash generation. it's all about how much money we're going to spend in Louisiana, right? So it's all about what -- how we're going to be able to derisk that project and manage that cash flow for that project in '26, '27 and maybe a little bit of '28 to make sure that we are cash neutral on this period. So that's the main point. So we're going to solve the equation to be cash neutral. We're not going to increase our debt. That's our spirit here and the level that we have is really the spending in the Louisiana project.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Kevin McCarthy, Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you and good morning. Eduardo, coming back to your blue hydrogen project in Louisiana, just wondering if you can provide an update on your business discussions for that project. For example, irrespective of the scope changes that you talked about, I think Air Products is pursuing partnerships for sequestration and also, as I understood, financial partners with an eye toward project financing. So how are those discussions going? And with regard to the new timeline of late '28 or possibly 2029, what is the rate-limiting step? Is it no longer receipt of the Class VI permit and it's shifted to the business side, sorting out some of the scope and financial issues that you outlined?
Eduardo Menezes: No, there is no issues with the permits. I think we are basically complete on the permit for the Class VI well. The issue really is how we progress in our discussions, both for the CO2 sequestration and the ammonia group. And how long it will take. Again, we're giving ourselves until the end of this year to get this concluded. And the final schedule will depend on how fast we can close these deals. In terms of project financing for the remaining scope of the project, which is the hydrogen and nitrogen plant is something that we may consider, but it's not even practical to start talking about that, before we can have the project completely delineated and we have partners, for the ammonia and in the CO2. So to make it clear, I'm not a big fan of project financing. I think it's expensive. I think it's something that we should do only in cases where we have joint ventures or other cases. But it has - for very large products like this one, like NEOM, it has some merit. And in the case of NEOM, frankly, it even helped us to keep the project very well contained in the box. So we do not have the same issues that we have in other places in terms of overruns and so forth. And I think part of that is a discipline that came with the project finance. So we're going to look for that. We may look for that depending on our cash flow and depending on the offers that we have. But that's not the priority right now, the priority are the CO2 and the ammonia loop.
Kevin McCarthy: I appreciate that. And then secondly, thank you for the updated comments on your infrastructure build-out in Europe. Just wanted to clarify what the status of that build-out is in the U.K., Netherlands and Germany. At one point, Air Products was talking about $2 billion for various import terminals in those countries. Can you comment on how much capital has been sunk and how much you're avoiding and what you would need to see to resume?
Eduardo Menezes: I would say that we're basically pausing all activity there. We're just doing the permitting and a little bit of engineering on all these places until we understand exactly what the regulations will be for each country. So we have some costs that - was some money that we spend that I think it's part of the overall charge that Melissa took, but it's not very significant compared to this $2 billion. And again, we are not going to spend anywhere close to this money going forward. I can tell you right now, when and/or where we're going to spend this money until we get clarity from the regulations from each country there.
Kevin McCarthy: Understood, thank you so much.
Operator: And our next question is going to come from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Just to come back to the merchant and so the non-on-site businesses. Can you just characterize what return hurdles you're using and how they compare to what has been used by Air Products over the last, I don't know, 10, 15 years. Have you significantly changed in any way the return hurdle metric? And secondly, within the footprint, how much of the region-by-region, and I mean, within like the local operations, how much of the footprint is actually in highly concentrated markets? And how much is in markets where you wish there was a - you need a significant increase in density, either by yourself or competitors to improve return on capital on a regional basis?
Eduardo Menezes: Let me try to answer. I don't know if I understood the question completely, but the merchant business for us, most of our merchant business comes from big back from large on-site plants. So basically, they are included on the calculations that we have for return on our projects. We - the hurdle rate is something that we don't talk publicly. I think it's fair to say it's double-digits and on top of that. And that the - any additional risk that we have, country risk, customer risk, regulatory risk, we need to add on top of our standard hurdle rate that we use for, let's say, the U.S. So that's all I can say on that. In terms of density, our business, I think it's -- we have good presence in most of the geographies where we participate. We don't participate in a lot of geographies. So if you go, for example, in Asia. You're going to see that 90% of our business is in three countries, in China, Korea and Taiwan. And the business in U.S. and in Europe, we have two very large competitors that are based there, so it's a little more complicated. But where we operate, we have good density. And I don't think we have any -- we're always going to have a place here and there that would like to have more, but it's not a main issue for us today.
Laurence Alexander: Thank you.
Operator: Our next call comes from Laurent Favre from BNP.
Laurent Favre: Yes. Good morning. You mentioned when you talked about the margin improvement, headcount reduction. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're going to do with the organization, incentivization as well as management structure, et cetera. So for instance, are you keeping the 12% Board - management Board that was announced last summer? Thank you.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you. Yes, I know in Europe, the term management Board has a very different meaning than it has in America. I was surprised with that as well. It doesn't have a legal meaning that it has in Europe, I need to think a little bit about that, how we call that in the organization and to avoid complications in people - especially people in Europe looking at this and thinking it's like a management board in Europe, which is not. So overall, I have to say that the message that we have here is not an easy message for our employees. I think our people are smart people. They understand that if today, we are spending $4 billion in capital above the maintenance capital in the projects, and we're going to go down to 1% to 1.5%. Of course, we're going to need to reduce and -- but I think that, in general, the employees that I talked to in Air Products that have 20, 30 years in the company, they understand that we are in a rough patch here. And they, in general, support the measures and they understand that we need to do some of these movements, in order to have the company to bring back the strength of the company, and avoid even further cuts in the future. So overall, I think I expect that to be well understood by the employees. And in terms of the management of the company, I'm still working with the regional group that we have here. Of course, we're going to have changes here, and there like you have in any business, but there is no drastic changes or no big restructures to announce.
Laurent Favre: Thank you. And on the capital allocation side, apart from the descoping, which I assume you hope to get some proceeds for -- are you considering any disposal or certain business lines or certain countries?
Eduardo Menezes: You're talking about divesting of countries and operations?
Laurent Favre: Yes.
Eduardo Menezes: Yes, no, the short answer would be no. I would say that we are industrial gas company, we are an industrial gas business. And whenever there is a business we're going to try to be there. That doesn't mean that if you have a very small position in some geographies that, doesn't make a lot of sense for you to be there that, you're not going to consider that. But nothing major, nothing that like I've seen some considerations before in for our products in the press like South Korean things like that. We're definitely not going to - any of these positions in Air Products.
Laurent Favre: All right, thank you.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hi, good morning Eduardo, one quick question. On the $5 billion underperforming assets. Air Products used to talk about generating roughly 15% on every dollar spent for EBITDA and about 10% on every dollar for EBIT, implying that depreciation is around 5%. Is that what your - you think the $5 billion, would generate around a 5% or mid-single-digit return. And then, if that formula is may be different than what you think. What do you think the return should be on every capital that Air Product spends on future projects? Thank you.
Eduardo Menezes: Okay. Yes. I understand the math. I think it's a very simplified version, 5% means that you are depreciating 20 years. In some cases, we do. In some cases, we do shorter than that. We think we have an accounting obligation to depreciate according to the life of the agreement. So it will be what it will be in each case. And again, it's one of these when we compete for these projects. It's really a tough fight, and it's about the CapEx that you have, the efficiency that you have in your plants, the O&M cost, and it's about your expected IRR. So obviously, we try to avoid make comments about that publicly. We were not going to be in the range of ROC that we want to be if every project comes at, let's say, 10% IRR. So we need projects to come higher than that. But that's all I can say at this point. We will not talk about publicly, what our hurdle rates are, because that's a sensitive information from a competitive point of view.
Mike Sison: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our last question from John Roberts from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you and welcome as well. Do you expect any material recovery on what's already been spent in Louisiana, for CCS and ammonia? And would that recovery likely be rolled into a favorable contract for CCS or a hydrogen offtake agreement?
Eduardo Menezes: Again, we are negotiating that. We cannot make a lot of comments on that. I think, of course, in the ammonia side that makes all the sense in the world. In the CO2 side, there are some other options that we may look at. But certainly, the sites that we have and the work we've done in the CO2 side, it has value, and it can be monetized within this project, or as a standalone operation. So I think that's our goal in both cases.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back over to Eduardo, for any closing or additional remarks.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you for attending the call, and have a safe day, and I look forward to see you in the next quarter. Bye.
Operator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2025 Q1  (2025-02-06 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that the presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Eric Guter. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Guter: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products first quarter 2025 earnings results teleconference. This is Eric Guter, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. On today's call, I'm also pleased to welcome Air Products' Chairman of the Board, Wayne Smith; and Eduardo Menezes, Air Product's new CEO, effective tomorrow, February 7, 2025. Please turn to Slide 2, and let me now turn the call over to Wayne for a few brief remarks.
Wayne Smith: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. Air Products Annual Meeting of Shareholders was held exactly two weeks ago and five new Directors were elected to our Board. The reconstituted Board met immediately, quickly coalesced, worked intensively, and made several key leadership decisions. First, I'm honored to have been elected as Chairman of the Board of Air Products where I've served as a Director since 2021, following my career in the chemicals industry, which included 11 years in industrial gases. Second, I'm honored to be working with our new Vice Chairman, Dennis Reilley. Dennis had a tremendous career in the industrial gas industry, leading Praxair as CEO. Prior to that, Dennis held executive roles at DuPont and Conoco in industries which are significant consumers of industrial gases. Finally, and most significantly, I'm very pleased to introduce our new CEO, Eduardo Menezes, who is on the call today. Eduardo brings more than 3.5 decades of international experience in all key sectors of industrial gases. At his last position, he was EVP of Linde for Europe, Middle-East and Africa with responsibility for operations in more than 40 countries, over $8 billion in sales, and more than 18,000 employees. He's lived and worked around the world. We all look forward to working with him, taking Air Products forward and maximizing value for shareholders. Let me now turn over the call to Eduardo to briefly introduce himself.
Eduardo Menezes: Thank you, Wayne. Air Products is a fantastic company for a bright future, and I'm honored to have the opportunity to work with the team to build on the Company's strong positions. I met several largest shareholders during the last few weeks to understand their perspectives and requests. And starting tomorrow, I will begin meeting with employees, customers, and business partners to move Air Products forward. Tomorrow is my first day as a Air Products employee so I apologize if I'm not going to be able to take questions on this call. But I look forward to sharing my priorities as the new CEO of Air Products and to presenting the second fiscal quarter results on the next call. Now, I'll turn the call back to Wayne.
Wayne Smith: Thank you, Eduardo. Before turning the call back over to the management team, I would like to take a moment to thank the outstanding employees of Air Products, who have remained dedicated, energized, and focused throughout this process. I'd also like to thank Seifi Ghasemi for his countless contributions and leadership of Air Products over the past decade. We have a great foundation to build upon. Now, as you can appreciate, given the changes underway, the scope of today's call will be limited to a discussion of quarterly results of the company and our outlook. We appreciate you may have a variety of questions, which extend beyond the results of the quarter, which will be addressed in due course. But for today, we kindly ask that questions be limited to and focused on the financial results that we disclosed this morning and our outlook for the remainder of the year. With that, let me turn it back over to Eric.
Eric Guter: Thank you, Wayne. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on the earnings page of our website at investors.airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide 3. Additionally, throughout today's discussions, we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax-rate and ROCE either on a total company or segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures refer to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our investor website in the relevant earnings release section. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Melissa.
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Eric, and good day to everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 of the materials we have posted on the website for this call. Safety is our number one priority without exception. We are proud of the continuous improvement we were able to achieve in this area, but our goal and efforts are always towards zero accidents and zero incidents. Now, please turn to Slide 5 for our first-quarter results. As we announced in January, first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.86 exceeded the upper-end of our guidance range of $2.75 to $2.85, up 1% over last year, driven by results in the Americas. Our earnings per share improved despite the divestment of the LNG process technology and equipment business, which closed at the end of fiscal 2024. The LNG business contributed roughly $0.08 to our first-quarter earnings in 2024. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was up 140 basis-points and our adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points versus prior year. Please turn to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2025 second-quarter and full-year outlook. We are maintaining our fiscal 2025 full-year guidance. We continue to monitor the strengthening U.S. dollar, tariffs and the global helium market for potential impact for the remainder of the year. Consistent with our focus on driving productivity, we continue to evaluate actions to reduce our costs and improve our services to our customers. We expect our second-quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which is up 1% to 4% reflective of the LNG divestiture. We are proud of the results this quarter. I am particularly grateful that our people stayed focused on the work at hand, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to our customers, shareholders and all whom we serve. I would like to thank them for their support and continued efforts to position the company for long-term success. Now please turn to Slide 7 for a detailed review of our first-quarter results. Compared to last year, overall volume was down 2%, primarily due to the LNG business divestment. Volume in Americas improved this quarter, but was offset by the weakness in Europe. Total company price was up 1%, which equates to a 2% improvement for the merchant business driven by continued pricing strength in the Americas and Europe. Adjusted EBITDA improved 1%, primarily due to a better price, partially offset by higher costs and lower equity affiliate income. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 140 basis points due to favorable business mix and price. Sequentially, volume was down following a strong finish to fiscal 2024 and the sale of the LNG business in September. Now please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of our first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.86 increased $0.04 despite the $0.08 contribution from LNG in the prior year, which is reflected in our volume variance. Price, net of variable-cost was favorable at $0.10, demonstrating continued strength in the Americas and Europe. The pricing improvement more than offset unfavorable other costs of $0.07. Lower prior year incentive compensation and inflation drove increased costs, which were partially offset by our productivity improvements. Now, please turn to Slide 9 for a brief discussion of our business segment results. You can find individual slides covering each of the business segments in the appendix. Looking at each business segment. Americas overall pricing was 2% higher with improvement across most product lines. This translates to a 4% merchant pricing gain for the region. The 3% volume improvement was driven by a significant non-recurring sale of helium to an existing merchant customer. These factors drove adjusted EBITDA 6% higher and improved adjusted EBITDA margin by 150 basis points. For our Asia segment, the 2% volume improvement was driven by contributions from new assets. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7%, primarily due to favorable volumes, costs and equity affiliate income. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 160 basis points. Looking at Europe results, broad-based pricing improved 1%. Volume was down 5% driven by lower onsite and continued weakness in merchant demand, primarily helium. Adjusted EBITDA was 3% lower as weaker volume was partially offset by higher price and favorable cost. The Uzbekistan project is undergoing planned facility upgrades during the first-half of fiscal 2025. We expect the facility to return to normal operation and contribute near its full run-rate at the start of the third quarter. Moving to our Middle-East and India segment. Lower merchant volume was a headwind for sales and adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was also negatively impacted by unfavorable equity affiliate income and cost. Finally, for our Corporate and Other segment, sales and profits were lower this quarter, primarily due to the sale of the LNG business. Thank you. And now we will be delighted to answer your questions. And as a reminder, we request that questions be limited to our financial results and our outlook.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. Just very quickly, just given all the moving parts in Asia, how should the Street be thinking about obviously some of the past headwinds in the helium business and electronics recovery and just general macroeconomic conditions in China? Are there just general things we can do to triangulate the forward outlook from this point in time? Thank you so much.
Melissa Schaeffer: Hi, Chris, great to hear from you. So, yes, let's talk about China. So China was supported this quarter by new assets and productivity actions. But China is still a wait-and-see. So right now, we see no material improvement. The market still remains challenging. We obviously are watching tariffs as well as the China in country stimulus impact. In the meantime, we remain focused on productivity and the things that we can manage and we're focusing on delivering to our customers.
Chris Parkinson: Got it. And just as a quick follow up, can we just get a quick update on the Alberta project, please. Thank you.
Melissa Schaeffer: So thanks, Chris. From a project perspective, at this point in time, I don't have any new updates from what we had previously shared on calls. When we have updates, obviously, we'll bring that information to you.
Chris Parkinson: All good. Thank you.
Melissa Schaeffer: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning, guys. So at the midpoint of both your Q2 and the full-year, you need the second-half to be about $1.50 per share better than the first half. Can you give us a walk, how much of that is seasonality and how much is stuff like the Uzbekistan plant coming back, and obviously, the helium going away, just some of the one-off stuff that helps us in the walk from first-half to second-half?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Hi, Duffy, thanks for the question. So the split for the first half and second half is relatively consistent to what we've seen in the past couple of quarters, about 1% difference. There is definitely, seasonality in Q1 and in Q2 because of the Lunar New Year in China. As you mentioned, we do have several planned maintenance outages, obviously, Uzbekistan being the most significant one. For the second half, we are going to be focusing on pricing action, Uzbekistan coming back on-stream early in Q3. We're obviously going to be looking to capture volume opportunities and we are going to be executing the remainder of our productivity initiatives. We are though watching tariffs and seeing the impact from a customer perspective, obviously watching this strengthening dollar and really just the general macro and geopolitical environment. So keeping an eye on all those things as we lead into the rest of the year.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And then if you looked at the Americas excluding that one time sale of helium, what would price and volume have been in Q1?
Melissa Schaeffer: Fantastic, Duffy. So let me just give you some generalizations about the Americas business. So pricing was strong across our product lines outside of helium, and hydrogen volumes remained strong, and they were very strong in our HEICO's business and we actually, saw some improvement in our merchants.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. Thank you.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes.
Operator: And we'll move to our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Good morning. Can you provide a breakdown on the CapEx outlook for the fiscal year, the $4.5 billion to $5 billion? How do you expect that CapEx to be deployed by projects?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. So we don't -- we aren't going to be breaking up at $4.5 billion, but the vast majority is going to be the deployment to our large projects. We've got about $750 million associated to ongoing maintenance, and then there's about $1 billion that we associate to our normal, let's call it traditional industrial gas business. We're still forecasting that $4.5 billion to $5 billion to be what we're looking for this fiscal year.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you, Melissa. And any update on the permitting project in the World Energy?
Melissa Schaeffer: So at this point in time, as we've talked about, that project still is on hold, awaiting permits. When we've got new updates for that, obviously, I'll bring it to you.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. What was the helium EBITDA contribution in the Americas in the quarter if there was one?
Melissa Schaeffer: So, Jeff, as always, we've not broken out helium. So I apologize…
Jeff Zekauskas: I mean, from the sale -- from the sale…
Melissa Schaeffer: I'm sorry. Fantastic.
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So -- sorry. Sorry, Jeff, go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: From the outsized sale, what was the benefit from that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So from the one-time sale that what we're calling the non-recurring Americas sale, that is about a 10% EPS contribution for this quarter.
Jeff Zekauskas: 10% for the whole company, or 10% for that unit?
Melissa Schaeffer: $0.10, sorry. $0.10 EPS.
Jeff Zekauskas: 0.10%? Okay.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes.
Jeff Zekauskas: Great. And then lastly, can you talk about the overall helium market and what's happening with pricing? Is it different in the different geographic jurisdiction?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Let's talk about helium. Thanks, Jeff. So the helium market, as you're aware, is silicon in nature. We've worked through these so called ups and downs for many decades. At this moment, the market is long. We are seeing helium come from the Russian assets into Asia, which is making the market wrong. But we're continuing to manage that and optimize our helium business. And obviously, we are in a unique position to really reliably supply our customers.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you.
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Melissa, in the Americas on volume ex-helium, were volumes down around 3%?
Melissa Schaeffer: No. So helium was a contributor, but we really saw very strong merchant volumes. And our HEICO business, especially along the Gulf Coast continues to be very strong. So helium was a bit of a headwind outside of the one time, but again, merchant volumes were very strong and HEICO was strong as well.
David Begleiter: Understood. And just in the Middle East and India, can you talk about the equity affiliate income decline and what drove that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure, absolutely. Great question. So the equity affiliate income noise was really around our Jazan joint venture. Given the nature of that contract, we do see some fluctuations quarter-by-quarter, but the Jazan project is contributing as expected and we do anticipate the contributions to be on par with what we saw in 2024.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, David.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just on the 2Q guide, it looks like EPS is maybe about a nick or better sequentially if we back out the $0.10 or so from the helium non-recurring sale. Can you just speak high level what's sequentially getting better or worse as we think about modeling here?
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure. For the second quarter, we are looking to see some headwinds from Uzbekistan, but we obviously, have some seasonality going into Q1 in many of our geographies. So we will see improved volumes in the Americas. We're continuing to focus on pricing in Europe, especially with the higher power costs that we're seeing there. And as I mentioned, we are closing out the execution of our productivity programs that we had over the last couple of years. So those should really start to show through in many of our regional results.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. And then just a quick clarification or confirmation. Is full-year guidance, it does not assume any contribution from the Alberta project this year. Is that correct?
Melissa Schaeffer: That is correct.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citi.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi. Good morning. Melissa, you mentioned you're monitoring the tariff impact from customers. I'm just wondering what your latest thoughts are there. Any conversations with customers suggesting this could be maybe a short-term negative to production, but is there any sort of long-term benefit of higher manufacturing here in the Americas, for example?
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure. Yes. Tariffs are definitely on everybody's mind, Patrick. So first, as you know, for the vast majority of our products, we're in region for region. Industrial gas is a localized model. So likely from a supply chain and a localized customer perspective, that should have little impact. There could be an impact on projects. We anticipate relative to the size of our projects to be moderate. And of course, we have a global diversified supply chain to reduce that exposure. But as you note, we do need to consider the macro impact to our customers and the knock-on effect to these tariffs. So we're staying very close to them and updating our forecast to meet their new production needs.
Patrick Cunningham: Got it. Very helpful. And then interest expense came in a bit lower than what was expected, maybe down $7 million or $8 million sequentially. I mean, is there anything -- any additional interest being capitalized, anything strange about the quarter? Or is this a sort of quarterly rate that we can expect going forward?
Melissa Schaeffer: So interest obviously, has a little bit of movement based on the timing of the debt draw. So we did obviously, have capitalized interest associated to our NEOM projects as well as our other projects. Largest contribution of capitalized interest, of course, going to NEOM, but no -- nothing else really significant other than that capitalized interest. Obviously, as we take our new debt, that will increase, but we'll look to maximize capitalized interest as much as we can on our significant projects.
Patrick Cunningham: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: And we'll move to our next question from Josh Spector with UBS.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the second half bridge. I think in response to the earlier question, you talked about pricing actions. So specifically to that, I mean, I assume higher energy costs are having an impact negatively on 2Q. Is your comment about second half improvement that you recover some of that or do you have visibility to pricing actions beyond response to near-term energy that you have visibility to that you're baking into your guidance?
Melissa Schaeffer: Josh, thanks. It's good to hear from you. So, as I mentioned, we are seeing power cost increase specifically in Europe. So as you know, there is usually a month or a quarter depending on the customer delay and being able to capture that increase in power cost with pricing actions. So obviously the teams are working very hard with our customer base to be able to quickly action on those pricing actions, but there is usually about a month or so to maybe even a quarter delay. So, we are looking to take those pricing actions likely into the second half of this fiscal year.
Josh Spector: Okay, thanks. And can you just comment on what corporate cost is baked into your guide? I think the quarter came in a bit higher than we expected, so we're not sure what the right run rate is you're assuming there.
Melissa Schaeffer: So, we did see this quarter a bit of a headwind, let's call it about $0.07. Now as I mentioned in my comments, there is some inflation baked in there. The other main driver of that is, obviously, we had a tougher results last year, so we took incentive compensation down. So as we accrue for this year, you'll see a little bit of a headwind with the incentive compensation accrual. And obviously, last year, we're looking to take the actions and there was a little bit of cost associated with our productivity actions, having individuals come on and then being able to exit other individuals in other geographies. So productivity actions will start to really flow through this year. And likely in the second half, you'll see that really ramp up.
Josh Spector: Okay, thank you.
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho.
John Roberts: Thank you. And Wayne good to talk again and congratulations to Eduardo and Dennis. Wayne, how do you see the roles different between Chairman and Vice-Chairman?
Wayne Smith: Thanks, John, for your question. Listen, I think you can understand that we've got a lot of change going on right now. The Board really is coalescing and working nicely together, a lot to do. I think we can talk more on that in the future once we've got things moving along a little bit better. But thanks for the question, John.
John Roberts: Okay. And maybe Melissa, Uzbekistan is a relatively new plant, what upgrades does it need?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, thanks for the question, John. So as I mentioned, Uzbekistan is going through a planned maintenance. The Uzbekistan asset, when we took that asset on, we did determine that there was a need for a turnaround to allow some of the improvements to bring the plant up to speed to Air Products standard. So this is all part of the plan. We'll see that coming back on stream in Q3 and we'll see the full BFC run through the rest of the year. But again, was planned, was built into the original acquisition, pricing and plan for the BFC moving forward.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Daniel Rizzo: Hi, this is Daniel Rizzo for Laurence. Does your outlook for 2025 assume any improvement in like industrial activity or in consumer demand?
Melissa Schaeffer: So we -- thanks for the question. And we are not looking for very much improvement from a global perspective in industrial production. You guys can see the numbers. There is not a lot of significant improvement in any geographies that we're seeing. There's about 2%, I believe, from an average globally. So we're not looking to say there is going to be significant industrial production improvement throughout this year.
Daniel Rizzo: And can you guys remind us, in 2017, 2018, did those tariffs have any effect at all on the demand -- on your demand, on you and on your customer production levels, particularly in Asia, I guess, where the weather was focused last time?
Melissa Schaeffer: So I'm going to have to come back to you on that question. I was not CFO at that time, so I will have the teams come back to you with that answer on 2017 and 2018.
Daniel Rizzo: All right. Thank you very much.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, thank you.
Operator: We'll move now to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. I was wondering if you could provide an update on your blue hydrogen project in Louisiana. And specifically, I'm interested in the prospect for partnerships. I think in the past, you've discussed potentially bringing in an equity partner and/or partners for sequestration or blue ammonia offtake. I appreciate you've had your hands full perhaps in recent months, but wondering if there has been any progress made toward those ends. Thanks.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, Kevin, good to hear from you. So as associated to our Louisiana project, it's being executed on the normal course, no significant updates on the project execution on the normal course as we projected. From a partnership perspective, you're right, we've been busy, but the teams have been focused on going out and having the right conversations with parties that would be interested in equity partnerships coupled with offtake. So we are having those active conversations focusing largely in Asia, Japan, Korea on potential equity partnerships, but really are opening it up to other partnerships from an industry perspective as well. When we have an update and progress those discussions, obviously, we'll bring that forward to you.
Kevin McCarthy: Very good. And then secondly, Melissa, I think Air Products has signaled in the past that you would intend to be free-cash flow positive in fiscal 2027, I believe. Is that still the case? And perhaps you can elaborate on the free cash flow trajectory as you see it shaping up here through the management transition if possible?
Melissa Schaeffer: Great question. Yes. Let's talk about cash flow. So, we are still projecting to be net cash-flow positive in FY2027. That's still the forecast. We could look, as we just talked about, for opportunities for equity partnerships, potentially even project financing if the portfolio fits. And as those progress, obviously as I said, I will keep you updated. And at this point in time, I look forward to working with Eduardo and the Board to understand what their plans are for the projects. And as we have updates from that perspective and how that affects our cash flow, obviously we'll bring those forward as well. No changes at this point in time.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Abigail] on for Mike. I know you touched on pricing in Europe being higher because energy prices are higher. Are you similarly going to be pushing for higher pricing in Americas and Asia as well?
Melissa Schaeffer: Absolutely. So pricing is something that we focus on a day-to-day hourly basis, right. So our teams are actively working pricing and that is not just unique to Europe. Europe, I spiked out specifically because we are seeing power cost increase, but we are trying to maximize pricing and the balance of pricing and volume every single day with our customers. So absolutely the teams are looking to take pricing actions where they can in the Americas and in the Asia market as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks. And are you able to give us a feel for the capital intensity of the Uzbekistan upgrade?
Melissa Schaeffer: So there is no -- a little bit of what I spoke about before is it's an increasing situation. So, this was negotiated into the acquisition price. So, there will be no additional capital outlay associated to these upgrades. That will be a discount to the $100 million that we have outstanding on that acquisition. So, the acquisition price doesn't change, no additional capital outlay than what we've spoken about before. It will just be a discount associated to the $100 million outstanding. We expect it to be much less, but that again will be no additional outlay for Air Products. Thank you for that question.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move to our next question from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I know Air Products had a number of cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives in kind of late '23 and then in '24 as well. Can you help us to think about how much in terms of the benefit of that we should see in 2025, and how it sequences through the year?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, John, it's great to hear from you, and thank you for the question. So you're right, we've had, let's call it two significant tranches of cost productivity actions. In aggregate, we've taken about 5% of our workforce down. If you look about that over a fiscal year, it's about $75 million. That being said, obviously, as you could consider, there is inflation as well as wage increases that could compensate -- overcompensate some of that, but we're still looking for the cost productivity to really support us in the back half of this fiscal year.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. So at least as of now, $75 million through 2025, offset by some inflation. Am I understanding that right?
Melissa Schaeffer: Proportional. So we'll see that ramp-up in the back half of the fiscal year. We are seeing some of that go through for Q1 and Q2, but not the full ramp.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes.
John McNulty: Okay. And then just one follow-up on Uzbekistan. I think that was supposed to add about $0.35, $0.36 to EPS on an annualized basis. Given what the turnaround work that you're doing, what do you expect that contribution to be in '25 just so we can kind of think about when we get to normalize what the additional help is going to be in '26?
Melissa Schaeffer: So -- and starting in Q3 we'll be fully ramped up again so you should take the proportional quarters for Q3 and Q4. We had about let's call it 1.5 months of contributions in Q1; Q2 will be down, and Q3 and Q4 should be fully ramped.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. Thanks for the color.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, absolutely. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you. I would like to thank everyone again for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Please stay safe and healthy, and all the best and have a wonderful day.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-11-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Eric Guter. Please go ahead, sir.
Eric Guter: Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter 2024 earnings results teleconference. This is Eric Guter, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased today to be joined by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at www.airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide 2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, either on a total company or segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures refer to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Eric, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to join our call today. Please turn to Slide 4 of the material we have posted on our website for this call. Ten years ago, we set a goal for Air Products to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, delivering excellent service to our customers. I am very proud to say that thanks to the outstanding efforts of all of our talented, dedicated and committed people at Air Products, we are today the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have achieved what we set out to do, and now we are ready to move forward. On the Slide 5, I'd like to point to our safety track record, which is our number one priority. We have made significant progress on both our employee lost time injury rate and recordable injury rate since 2014. We are very proud of this improvement. We will continue to strive to achieve zero accidents and zero incidents as the ultimate goal. We believe that all incidents and accidents are preventable. Now please turn to Slide 6 for a look at our fourth quarter results. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.56 was at the upper end of our guidance range of $3.33 to $3.63, up 13% over last year, driven by our three largest reporting segments. Both productivity and pricing actions contributed positively this quarter. We successfully completed the $1.8 billion sale of our LNG, process technology and equipment business to Honeywell at the end of September. The LNG business was part of our full fiscal year 2024 results. But with the sale, we no longer -- it will no longer contribute to our earnings going forward. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was up 460 basis points and our adjusted operating margin increased 350 basis points versus prior year. Please turn to Slide 7 for our fiscal year 2025 outlook, which is 2.5% higher than last year. We expect our ongoing business, which excludes the LNG business to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $12.70 to $13, demonstrating an improvement of 6% to 9% over last year. We expect our first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, which is flat to up to 4% when considering the LNG divestiture. As you know, our first quarter is typically our weakest quarter, impacted by seasonality. In addition, we are not forecasting any significant growth for this quarter due to our concerns about the economic activity in China. It is possible that economic activity in China might improve with actions that the Chinese government might take in the future, but we have not included that in our forecast. We are proud of our results this quarter, and I would like to thank the talented and dedicated people at Air Products for helping us to deliver these strong results. Working together, I am confident that we can achieve what we have put forth in our guidance for fiscal year 2025. Now please turn to Slide 8 where you can see our strong sustained performance over the long term. We have achieved a 10% annual growth rate in our adjusted earnings per share since 2014. We have delivered consistent results throughout significant ups and downs in the world economy. And as I just mentioned, we expect to continue that trajectory in fiscal year 2025 with adjusted EPS growth ranging from 6% to 9% on a like-for-like basis. Now please turn to Slide 9. Another top priority for us is to consistently return cash to our shareholders. Our sustained growth has enabled us to achieve a 9% annual growth rate in our dividend since 2014, and we plan to return about $1.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in dividend payments this year alone. We are proud of our record of increasing our quarterly dividend payments for 42 consecutive years. We take a balanced approach to determine our dividend, and we are confident that our sustained performance will enable us to continue rewarding shareholders through increased dividends while also meeting the cash needs of our growth strategy. Now please turn to Slide 10, which is my favorite slide, again demonstrating on long-term performance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin has expanded by almost 2,000 basis points over the last 10 years. We are now at a 44% adjusted EBITDA margin. We lead the industry when it comes to adjusted EBITDA margin, and this track record demonstrates our focus on effectively running our base industrial gases business. Now I would like to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarter four results. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 11 for a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Compared to last year, volume and price each improved 1% with positive underlying sales in our three largest regional segments. Higher on-site volume, including new assets more than offset lower demand for merchant products. Overall, price improved modestly driven by positive pricing results in the Americas and Europe. Declining natural gas prices, primarily in North America, resulted in 2% lower energy cost pass-through, which has no impact on profit. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% on favorable volume and price, which contributed to over 450 basis point improvement to adjusted EBITDA margin. Sequentially, sales and EBITDA improved across most reporting segments, driven by favorable on-site volumes. Now please turn to Slide 12 for a discussion of our adjusted earnings per share. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.56 was up $0.41 or 13% versus last year, driven by strong operating results. Overall, volume was up $0.15 on higher on-site partially offset by lower merchant demand. Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.23 driven by both pricing gains and lower power costs. Cost was favorable $0.05 as our productivity actions more than offset the impact of inflation. Now please turn to Slide 13 for a brief discussion of our business segment results. You can find individual slides covering each of the business segments in the appendix. Looking at each business segment. Americas overall pricing was 3% higher, while volume was flat. This translated to a 6% merchant pricing gain for the region with improvement across the product line. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and adjusted EBITDA margin improved over 650 basis points in each case, primarily due to strong pricing and favorable mix driven by onetime asset sale associated with an early contract termination at the request of the customer and higher hydrogen demand. Additionally, lower energy cost pass-through improved margin by approximately 200 basis points. Moving to our Asia segment. The 7% volume improvement was driven by our on-site business. including contributions from new assets. Adjusted EBITDA increased 21% and adjusted EBITDA margin improved almost 500 basis points. In each case, primarily due to favorable on-site volumes and costs. Looking at Europe's results, price was 2%, up with broad-based improvement across the region. Volume was flat as a new asset in Uzbekistan offset weaker merchant demand. Adjusted EBITDA improved 17% and adjusted EBITDA margin increased nearly 500 basis points in each case, mainly due to improved price. Switching to our Middle East and India segment, lower merchant volume negatively impacted sales and adjusted EBITDA. Unfavorable costs also contributed to lower adjusted EBITDA. For our Corporate and other segment, sales and profit were lower this quarter, primarily due to lower sales and higher cost estimates related to our sale of equipment activity. Finally, I'd like to close out the review of our performance and quarterly results on Slide 14. Our core industrial gas business remains as strong as ever, delivering significant EPS growth over the past decade and achieving industry-leading profitability and adjusted EBITDA margin. Air Products pioneered the on-site business model more than 80 years ago and about half of our business today is on site, proportionally higher than our peers. Our on-site business has contractual pass-throughs, which enables us to pass energy costs and other cost inflation to our customers. This, combined with our take-or-pay provisions in our customer contracts, enable the stability of our business. We generate strong and steady cash flow that supports reinvestment aligned with our disciplined capital allocation strategy. As we continue to show, this also fuels our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders with continued increases to our dividend. Through our core industrial gas business, we supply customers in dozens of industries with critical products and services, with the goal of being the safest most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Now I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now I would like to take this opportunity to discuss our growth strategy. Please turn to Slide 16. Our growth strategy consists of two pillars: our excellent core industrial gases business and our developing clean energy business. Our core industrial gas business is an industry leader. It is a stable business and grows at GDP, or industrial production levels, around the world. We continue to optimize for maximum efficiency and invest strategically to maintain our market share. In '23 and '24, almost half of our capital investment was related to our core industrial gases business. Second, we see tremendous opportunity in clean hydrogen, driven by strong demand for decarbonization solutions that we are already seeing play out today. We are particularly optimistic about the use of blue hydrogen in the form of clean ammonia to minimize the use of coal in Asia's power plants. Another promising demand is the use of blue ammonia directly to power ships. Dozens of such ships are already on order or under constructions. We are equally excited about the application of green hydrogen to meet Europe's emission reduction mandates across the heavy industrial and transport sectors. Green hydrogen has real demand today, and we expect to drive outside growth relative to our core industrial gas business over the long term. The two pillars of our growth strategy are complementary and interrelated, underpinned by our core competencies technology and of course, more than 65 years of hydrogen experience. We are committed to efficiently running and growing our core industrial gas business, while pursuing strategic high-growth and high-return opportunities in clean hydrogen. Now please turn to Slide 17. I want to expand on my comments about how we developed our clean hydrogen platform. Clean hydrogen is not a new business for Air Products. It's merely an extension of our existing core business. As I said, Air Products has been supplying hydrogen for more than 65 years over which time we have developed key customer relationships that span both the private and public sectors. About 30 years ago, Air Products pioneered the on-site hydrogen business model to take-or-pay provisions and contractual pass-through supplying hydrogen over defense to refineries in California. We then gradually expanded to the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada and Europe. We capitalized on global desulfurization regulations to ultimately become the world's largest hydrogen supplier with the most extensive hydrogen pipeline system. Now we are well positioned to capitalize on the next phase of hydrogen development, which is clean hydrogen supported by the need to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. We moved first with focus and conviction to capture the important first-mover advantages, which I will talk more about in a moment. Consistent with our traditional hydrogen business, clean hydrogen offtake will also follow the on-site business model, and we anticipate these projects will provide attractive returns. Our strategic first-mover actions are now creating the opportunity for us to become the world's largest clean hydrogen supplier. Please turn to Slide 18. There are clear advantages in moving first. We have been able to secure optimum locations for renewable resources, including for areas with strong sun and wind generation at the same time to produce low-cost green hydrogen. And for blue hydrogen, we have been able to gain access to the right geologies needed for carbon sequestration, which is the key enabler to making blue hydrogen. As mentioned, we also have been able to apply more than 65 years of hydrogen and technology expertise, which sets us apart. Finally, as we have demonstrated, the first mover gets the best seat at the table with customers to negotiate the best offtake agreements. On Slide 19, you can see an overview of the various regulatory drivers for clean hydrogen in Europe and Asia, focusing on heavy industry and transport sectors where battery electric meters are not effective. A wide range of industries need to decarbonize using clean hydrogen and we continue to extend our reach into these sectors. Now turning to Slide 20. Let me underscore the significant demand for clean hydrogen today. Various leading companies, including TotalEnergies, as one key example have issued request for quotation, requesting capacity equal to requirements that far exceed the capacity of our green hydrogen project and the construction in NEOM. Taking a step back, TotalEnergies's RFQ or as large as it is 500,000 tonnes per day accounts for only 10% of gray hydrogen now used by European refineries. And the output of our NEOM project is less than 5% of the gray hydrogen used by European refineries. And beyond refineries, there is demand for several other hard-to-abate sectors, including shipping and steelmaking. This strong demand in the market today gives us great confidence in our ability to load the green hydrogen facility and their construction in NEOM. Turning to Slide 21. This demonstrates the sheer scale of the clean hydrogen industry in the coming years. Clean hydrogen is expected to be more than $600 billion market by 2030 and eventually exceed $1 trillion by 2050. There is significant demand now, and that demand is expected to grow significantly over the long term. Air Products, capturing even a very small portion of that demand means that we will be well positioned to deliver significant growth. To demonstrate how large this market opportunity is, Air Products currently approved clean hydrogen projects account for less than 1% of future market expectations. Before we discuss our key projects, please turn to Slide 22 with important takeaways about our strategy and disciplined approach to creating shareholder value. Our core industrial gases business remains fundamentally strong with industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin and solid GDP and industrial production growth. We are adding to this strong foundation by pursuing attractive growth opportunities in clean hydrogen. Driven by decarbonization, future clean hydrogen demand is expected to be significant. We ultimately need to capture, as I said before, only a small portion of this anticipated high growth market for our initial projects to be successful. We believe favorable supply-demand dynamics will enable us an attractive return on green hydrogen. We are pursuing this strategy prudently and only approve new projects. And I'd like to stress, only approve new projects after securing anchor customers. As we have said before, we will not take any final investment decision on new projects until our current facilities are loaded, at least, 75% or more. We have focused teams within Air Products, executing these 2-pillar strategy. Our employees are dedicated to the ongoing success of both our core industrial gases business and our clean hydrogen business. Now I would like to take a moment to provide an update on our key project on Slide 24, where you can see an actual recent aerial photo of the NEOM project and their construction. I'd like to stress, this is a real project. It's not a computer-generated slide. It covers the ammonia production site, the electrolyzer facility and the jetty. Although this view covers a vast area, it does not capture the wind farms located 50 miles to the north near the Gulf of Aqaba, and the solar farms situated 40 miles to divest on the other side of the mountain range. We are full speed ahead on this project. Please turn to Slide 25. We have made immense progress on this green hydrogen project. Construction is about 60% complete, and we are on track to bring this facility on the stream at the end of 2026. There are 18,000 workers on the site building this facility today. Importantly, roughly 35% of the total amount of the production has been contracted on a take-or-pay basis. Negotiations are underway for additional offtake which would exceed the production of the facility. NEOM has been financed by 23 banks providing more than 70% of the total capital needed. Air Products is investing about $800 million or less than 10% of the total project cost. This is significantly less than the $1.7 billion that we originally projected for this project and illustrates our ability to execute highly successful project financing. Now please turn to Slide 26. In June of this year, we were delighted to announce a 15-year agreement to supply 70,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually to TotalEnergies beginning in 2030. This was a milestone for us and the pay nature of this agreement will drive stability in growing our clean hydrogen business. This pioneering agreement validates our clean hydrogen strategy and demonstrates significant demand for green hydrogen with one of the largest energy companies in the world. Moving to Slide 27. Let me share the status of two other major clean hydrogen projects. First, our Canada Net-Zero Hydrogen Energy Project. We have committed 60% of the capacity on a long term take-or-pay contract, and we are in active discussion for the remainder of the capacity. As for our Louisiana project, the Blue Hydrogen project, we have submitted for permits, which we expect to be issued in '25 and '26, and we have received major pieces of equipment already in the site in readiness for construction work. We are in active discussion for offtake from this facility, also in discussions with possible equity partnership and also assessing project financing for this project, and we will keep you updated as we move forward. Moving to Slide 28. As we have said before, we have put a sustainable aviation fuel project in Paramount, California on hold until we get our full permits. With regard to the proposed $4.5 billion joint venture to produce green hydrogen in Northern Texas. This project never reached final investment decision. It does not meet our established guidelines for new low-carbon project investments and therefore, we have stopped our involved in this project, and we have sold our development rights to our partners. Finally, on Slide 29. You can see that we continue to focus on our core industrial gas business, which accounts for more than 50% of our total fiscal '23 to fiscal '25 CapEx. Much of that CapEx is focused on growth. Projects for core industrial gas business and clean hydrogen both need to meet or exceed our internal return targets. We regularly evaluate alternative funding opportunities to optimize our cash allocation. Beginning in 2027, we anticipate meaningful decline in net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as well as possible net cash flow. Now for an update on succession planning. Please turn to Slide 33. As this cost in our last earnings call, we have decided to bring into the company a fully qualified potential successor, as President and a Member of our Board of Directors. This person should be well known to investors with a clear record of success, preferably a current or former CEO of a public company with significant international experience and relationships. This Board-driven process is being led by our Independent Director, Mr. Ed Monser with the support of the full Board and the executive firm, [indiscernible]. I'm happy to say that qualified candidates have already been identified, and we are anticipating announcing the President's name in the first half of fiscal year 2025. Now please turn to Slide 33. At Air Products, our two pillar growth strategy includes running our core industrial gas business efficiently and continuing to invest and grow it. At the same time, levering our 65 years of hydrogen experience to serve the large high-growth clean hydrogen market. We expect our clean hydrogen projects to achieve higher returns than our core industrial gas business. And the thing all of this is our relentless focus on thoughtful strategic capital allocation. Being a prudent steward of Air Products' capital has been and will continue to be our top priority. Now please turn to Slide 34. The people of Air Products are working hard every day to deliver for our customers, do so safely and deliver best in result profitability. Our operating discipline, combined with our focus on delivering shareholder value gives us confidence as we enter into the next chapter of our growth at Air Products. And now we will be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move first to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning, Seifi. Maybe I can start with something on the more immediate term. You've got some growth despite a difficult environment, looking out to 2025 versus 2024, I guess. Can you help us to kind of basket that a bit? How much comes from price? How much comes from some of the new projects that you've been gradually ramping through '24, and how much comes from core growth?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. Thank you for your question. John, for fiscal 2025, we obviously one of our major concerns and unknowns, is how does the demand develop in Asia. We have a pretty decent handle on our opportunities in Middle East, in Europe and in America. The big unknown is China. That is why we have taken a conservative approach there. Things might change depending on what the Chinese government does, but we're going to be cautious. In terms of right now, our expectation for price overall is similar to last year, about 1% to 2% price increase. Our volume growths are very much adjusted to the expected GDP and industrial production growth forecasted, for the different regions in the world, which is not that much. It's about sometimes 2%, 3% depending on which area you are. And then, we do not have too many significant large projects coming on stream, but we do have a lot of smaller projects coming on stream, which are going to contribute to our growth. We feel pretty good about our fiscal year guidance. I have to admit that we are very conservative on the first quarter, because of the immediate weakness that we see in China.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful color. And then maybe I can just ask a question on Louisiana. So you kind of mentioned a bunch of things going on there. You're looking for offtake partners. You're also looking for equity partners and maybe even project financing, I guess. Can you speak to what you see as the ideal equity partnership arrangement that you, that you're kind of pursuing at this point, and how we should be thinking about that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the ideal thing would be to have equity partnership with somebody who is going to take the optic. So that's kind of the obvious solution. But there are a lot of people who are have raised significant funds, so called clean funds and want to participate in equity with us. But our preference obviously would be with somebody who is going to take the offtake.
John McNulty: So it's less about coming up with a partner to take on some of the manufacturing, or other certain parts of the project. It's more about coming up with a partner for the off take. Am I thinking about that, right?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I think we would be interested in partnering with people on the manufacturing part too. Equity participation in the entire project.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much for the color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think that there are two prominent activists that seem to be involved in your products, and one of them published a large slide deck, maybe generally speaking, all about the de risking of various projects. When you listen or look at the activist approach to Air Products, how do you reflect on it? Is it something that leads you to change your behavior in any way or not change your behavior? How do you assess the different new owners and Air Products and their ideas about the company?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, thank you for your question. Air Products has 220 million shares. We have many, many investors and we have respect for all of our investors. As you know very well, we meet very often with our investors, and we believe the view of all of the investors is as important as the view of one investor. So I don't want to single out the fact that we listened to a particular investor, we listen to all of our investors. And the suggestions that have been made by all of our different investors, is pretty consistent. They want us to focus on our base industrial gases business, which we are. And they also want to make sure that we are investing in the developing clean hydrogen business in a responsible way. And we are obviously doing that. And all of our investors throughout the years always ask about succession planning, and we have always been very diligent about succession planning, and we have now laid out very specifically what we want to do. So as I said, we listen to all of our shareholders, and we take their views very seriously and consider them and then act on them if necessary.
Jeff Zekauskas: Then for my follow-up, I think on Slide 20 you said you expect to fully load NEOM before the on stream date. The commitment with Total I think is for 2030. So does this fully loading NEOM mean that it would be fully loaded for 2027, or does it mean that it would be fully loaded for 2030? In other words, from the assessment of the profit contribution of NEOM, should one expect a full loading for 2027 if you're mechanically complete at the end of 2026?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff? We expect to fully load NEOM, and we are working toward that in 2027. Yes, that is our expectation. That is what we are working on. Because there are other customers beyond Total. Total, we got their permission to announce it publicly with the other people. We don't have such permission. And when the time comes, we will announce that.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: We'll move next to Patrick Cunningham with Citi.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. I wanted to, with the LNG out of the business, what should we expect in terms of the corporate line for 2025? I know you've taken significant productivity actions. So what might be the offsets from cost reduction on the corporate line?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that's a very good question and I'd like to give Melissa a chance to respond to that. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Hi. Thank you, Seifi. So LNG is about a 4% contributor or about $0.49 to the organization, obviously evenly distributed throughout the quarters with some timing based on delivery of the product. So we're seeing about a 4% headwind going into FY 2025 or again about $0.49 for the full year.
Seifi Ghasemi: So if I may add to that, that means that during 2025, we obviously have taken and will continue to take actions in terms of productivity, and we obviously have growth from the, as I said, smaller projects. And we hope that the strong economic activity that we saw in the U.S. will continue in 2025, which we think it will. And in Europe we have opportunities for some of our on sites to do a little bit better than they did last year.
Patrick Cunningham: Okay, understood. Very high, very helpful. And could you provide a more general update on the World Energy Project? What is holding up the permitting process? Is there anything about the relationship or project budget, that we should know there?
Seifi Ghasemi: What is holding up the permit was the fact that the permit that was issued was challenged, by some people who call themselves environmentalists, but they are doing an environmental friendly project. But they go and object to our permit. But so that is what is holding it up. And we have decided that we do not want to take the risk of building the project and continuing, with the project and then get challenged again. So we want to make sure we have all of the permits before we go forward. That's the reason we have put that project on hold. In terms of our relationship with our partners there, the relationship between Air Products and World Energy is excellent. And we are working in concert, hand-in-hand to make that project a successful investment. At the same time, as I say on the slides, Air Products is looking at other alternatives for that project, because some people have expressed interest in kind of buying us out of that project. And we obviously will listen to our alternatives.
Patrick Cunningham: Understood. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Wanted to just drill into NEOM a bit more, Seifi four years ago, I believe you were talking about a downstream CapEx budget for NEOM of $2 billion. What is the status of that now given? I think back then your focus was Asia, it's now Europe. Do you have a strategy of what do you need to invest in Europe, to distribute the green ammonia, and then crack the hydrogen? Perhaps comment also on your ammonia cracking technology and the efficiency. And just lastly that, the 35% seems more than total. Does that mean you've picked up other long-term take or pay contracts?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for your question. The amount of investment in the downstream obviously depends on who the final end customers are. But $2 billion order of magnitude for that is in the ballpark. But it might be a lot less than that, depending on who the actual customers are going to be in terms of. As I said, there are a lot of ways to sell the product out of that plant. One is to take it, crack it and put it in a refinery. Another one is that some people might be interested in just buying the ammonia FOB NEOM and using it for applications that you don't need cracking. So there is a lot of different possibilities there. And as we finalize the contracts we will give you more visibility on that.
Steve Byrne: And maybe just one more on this. Europe prefers the pathway forward being green, not blue. If that were to change for economic reasons, what would be your end market outlook for NEOM under that kind of a scenario?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, can I may just make a comment. We are committed to low carbon hydrogen, green and blue. That is why we are doing the project in NEOM for green and the project in Louisiana for blue. Because we think the lowest cost place to produce green is in Northern Saudi Arabia, and the lowest cost place to produce blue is in U.S. Gulf Coast. That no place in the world can compete with the U.S. Gulf Coast, because of the low natural gas. But more importantly, when people talk about blue, they need to keep in mind, you can only make blue if you have a place to sequester the CO2, and it is not that easy to find those places. So we are committed to both of them. And we look at those opportunities in an equal way. We don't have any preference for one or another.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Huang: Hi, this is David Huang here for Dave. I guess one of the concerns investors have is on your large headcount increase since you started the journey in Green Hydrogen. How much of the headcount increase through the years is related to the Clean Hydrogen projects? And if you can talk about how the staff is being deployed to support these projects? And additionally, I guess given the SAF project that's on hold and you're no longer pursuing the Texas project, are there any opportunities to reduce some costs here in the near term? And how should we think about this scale if you have any of those plants?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that I think we need to explain that because the big headcount increase was in order to engineer NEOM and our Blue Hydrogen project and several other projects that we had. So those headcounts are going to come down, but they are not going to affect our bottom line because those costs were capitalized as part of the capital. So our earnings per share and so on was not being affected by those increases. We did have increased costs, significant increased costs in terms of development costs while we were developing those projects. Those costs are going to come down. And I'm sure that you have taken a look at our SG&A line and you see that our SG&A for the quarter is less than last year's quarter and for the year it's less than last year. So the headcount thing which went up, is going to come down. But in terms of our bottom line, we are going to continue march toward the 8%, 9%, 10% growth on EPS as we have done in the past 10 years.
David Huang: Okay.
Seifi Ghasemi: And at this point in time, I'm sorry, please go ahead.
David Huang: Oh, go ahead.
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I was just going to say at this time, other than NEOM, where most of the engineering is basically done, we are working on engineering on our project in Louisiana and one or two other projects in Texas and our Edmonton project. Other than that, we are not working on any other major project. And as you just saw, we just cancelled any commitment or any engineering effort that we are going. We were spending on the North Texas in Green Hydrogen project because it did not meet our criteria, which was that we do not make final investment decision until we have an anchor customer and until we have loaded 75% of our existing facilities. So as a result, there are no too many other projects in the pipeline. We always think about these things and so on. But we will only move on those once those criteria are met. Okay?
David Huang: Yes. And then just another question on Alberta. Just to clarify, this is not included in your FY '25 guidance, and if not, when do you expect the plan to start up?
Seifi Ghasemi: No significant income is included in our fiscal year 2025 income for that project. Yes.
David Huang: Okay. Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to John Roberts with Mizuho.
John Roberts: Thanks, Seifi. I'm guessing the board has already been maintaining some level of contact with prudential president candidates that could be available on short notice, especially since the departure of Dr. Serhan. Do you think the search for a President could be over before the proxy is filed for the shareholder meeting? Slide 31 suggests it could go beyond the shareholder meeting.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, at this point in time, I do not expect for us to name a President until March, April, May. We have identified very highly qualified people. They are being interviewed by our board and going through the process. I mean, choosing a President for Air Products, we have to go through the process. Our board needs to feel very comfortable and they need to meet the criteria that I set out that we want people who have been CEOs of public companies, people who have not been CEOs of public companies do not qualify. So the process is underway. I just wanted to give you an update. But we have no expectation of announcing a President before, as I said before, March, April, May, depending on the availability of the people, because if these people are CEOs of current companies, they have obligations and to unwind their present position. So it's not going to be -- you can't just snap your finger and have them start. Okay, John, thank you.
John Roberts: Yes. That's all I have. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Thank you very much, John.
Operator: We'll move next to Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much, Seifi, regarding the Louisiana project, obviously it's fairly sizable and there's a lot of focus on both manufacturing as well as the offtake agreements in terms of redistributing potentially some of that project risk. However, one of the things that's been on my mind and I think a lot of investors has been just given the size of the facility, just the construction outlay and how to think about the various units going into that just relative to the size of everything else that's been done in the United States over the last decade or decade and a half. So, can you perhaps just give us a little bit more detail on the various stages on how we should be thinking about that development or evolution of that project and whether or not it has to be all at once or you're thinking about it in various stages, perhaps one through three, just any color there would be particularly helpful? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much, Chris, for your very thoughtful question. The project in Louisiana, the most important part of that project was finding a place that is credible and proven that you can sequester CO2. We have achieved that. We have identified sites. We have the rights to that. We have done extensive work, spend about $75 million with seismic studies and so on to prove that it is possible to sequester CO2 in there. We have submitted all of that to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Resources for an application for a Class 6 well. We have gotten feedback that our application is complete. That means that they accept that they have done all of the work and now we need to wait until they make their assessment and issue the final permit for us to construct that. That was the major risk for that project. The rest of the project, what is it? It is making the hydrogen that we know how to do, it is POX units. It's our own technology. We have similar units in operation around the world, and therefore there is no technology risk there. And then the ammonia plant is the ammonia plant. Everybody is very familiar with ammonia plants. So we are not taking any technology risk. The CO2 sequestration is secure. And now it is the question of how fast we build this thing. We have said previously that this project, we expect to come on stream sometime in 2028, depending on the timing of the permits. We feel pretty good about that. We feel pretty good about the number that we have announced publicly, about $7 billion. So right now our task is we don't want to spend $7 billion of Air Products capital into the project. So the issue is, how do we finance this thing? Do we finance it the way we finance NEOM? Do we bring in an equity partner? Those are the things that we are evaluating. And in the meantime, we are not in a hurry. We have time. We have done most of the engineering. We are going to start bringing contractors where the engineering is done so that we can get lump sum prices from the contractors. So we are executing this project in a very prudent way and trying to find the optimum way for us to finance the project. In terms of the demand for the product we feel very good about that, because the demand is not only decarbonizing and reducing the use of coal in Asia, but another significant demand which is developing, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is ammonia as a direct fuel for ships. Low carbon ammonia using as a direct fuel for ships significantly reduces the emissions. It makes ships comply and it is very attractive to the people who ship their product across the board because that helps them to decarbonize their Scope 3 emissions. So we feel very good about that project. And as I said, as we move forward, we'll update you about the progress on all of those fronts.
Chris Parkinson: It's very helpful. And just a real quick one here is, regarding the CapEx of the NEOM, the 2 billion of the offtake. You mentioned a few questions ago that there could be a material difference between the initial expectation, and I believe it was to everything to Asia and Europe in terms of transportation and buses and everything else we discussed back in 2020. But if we just took something such as the total agreement and said, hey, that's roughly one third of the production, let's call that of the original amount, $667 million, what is the difference roughly, just purely roughly, of kind of that implied number of, let's say the legacy thought process and what you could be looking at today? Is that like a 10% difference to refineries in Europe or is that something that could be more significant like a 30% or 40% difference in terms of like how we're thinking about the offtake CapEx of the project? Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much. I'm just trying to fully digest your question, Chris. In terms of you're asking a very good question. But fundamentally, originally when we announced the project, we said that we will need $3.7 billion of cash. And we broke it down to $1.7 billion invested in the project and $2 billion for so called terminals to sell it. What we are saying is that the 1.7 investment in the production is now $800 million, because we were able to successfully project finance this. The $2 billion for the downstream part, I can make a commitment exactly what that would be, whether it's half of it, 10% lower and so on until they finalize who the offtakers are. So that's where we are, Chris. Okay? So overall in terms of our total commitment from before, the number has not really changed. Okay?
Chris Parkinson: Thank you very much as always.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, Chris.
Operator: We'll move next to Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hi, good morning, Seifi, traditional hydrogen projects, historically you tend to sell that out with offtakes when you sign them. Was that the case when you sort of created the business 60 to 65 years ago? And do you think at some point for the clean hydrogen projects that demand will be big enough? When you announce a project, you'll have offtakes immediately?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is kind of what I was trying to allude to when I said that in the future we will not take an FID on any clean hydrogen project until we have an anchor customer. Just like our industrial gases business, when we go and sell oxygen to a steel plant, we build the air suppression unit. 50% of the offtake is guaranteed with a takeover bay to the steel maker and then the other 50% is merchant that what we do. So we are saying that in the future we wanted to be the first mover. We did what we did with NEOM and with -- and it has turned out to be a good experience. We are trying. We are seeing that we can load these facilities. Now we are saying that in the future we are not going to announce a project without having and telling you a clear view of who will take 50%, 60% of the product on a long term basis. That's okay.
Mike Sison: Yes, that's great. And then just a quick follow up. When you think about your earnings growth for '25, 6% to 9%, I understand the economic environment isn't great. But if you think about longer term and you execute well on your pretty well publicized growth strategy, '26, '27, '28, what do you think that growth rate should kick up to as your clean energy projects kick in with the growth from your core industrial gas business?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think that if we put everything together and things work out the way we are, we think it is, we will be able to deliver about 9%, 10%, '25, '26 and then '27, '28 can be significantly higher than that, because these projects coming on a stream with the kind of volumes that they are talking about, we can have significant growth higher than 10%. That's why I feel confident to say that for the next 10 years, considering what is going on, I think Air Products will deliver at least 10% growth in EPS as we go forward, at least.
Mike Sison: Great, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: I'll move next to Josh Spector with UBS.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the NEOM offtake. There's just been some chatter I guess more recently around some finer details around that contract. So you highlighted take or pay. You mentioned you're comfortable with the returns. I guess some of the questions have been if there's any qualifying events, be it regulatory or credits, that need to be put in place before that contract goes into effect or whether you would say what you have today is more ironclad. There's nothing that needs to happen for that to hit your return targets?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that's a very detailed question about the details of the contract. We are continuing to negotiate the details, but I have my Chief Legal Officer, Mr. Sean Major, who was very instrumental in negotiating that contract. So I think it's better if I turn it over to him to try to amplify on that. Sean?
Sean Major: Yes. Thank you, Seifi. We are generally comfortable with that contract. It's consistent with similar offtake agreements, and we're fully confident that will be fully operational, consistent with the terms of the agreement.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay.
Josh Spector: Okay. Appreciate that. And just on another note, if I could just ask, on your approach to project returns when using leverage or not using leverage, I guess now a couple of your bigger products, you're talking about using more leverage. Do you expect that when you employ project financing, are you targeting a higher equity return or is that still in the framework that you would target that greater than 10%, 12% return? So how should investors kind of work that into our framework of what the flow through is on Air Products equity return from investments?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I'm very happy that you asked the question. We evaluate the projects on the basis of unlevered IRR. That is our criteria. Then later on, if we are able to project finance it, obviously, hopefully the financing is less than our cost of capital and therefore the return on equity will be higher than the IRR. So we do not approve projects on the basis of leverage. It is all unlevered. And then if we are able to finance it, then obviously will improve the return on equity that Air Products has put into the project. That okay?
Josh Spector: Yes, very clear. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll move next to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. Seifi, on Slide 29, you indicate that you would expect to return to a positive net cash flow position starting in 2027. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on some of the assumptions behind that goal. For example, would it be contingent upon bringing in a partner and/or project financing in Louisiana, or could you get there on an organic basis, so to speak, without the benefit of those actions? And perhaps there are other assumptions you might like to speak to.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, John, for the question. I'd like to turn that over to Melissa to answer that. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure. Thank you, Seifi. So our current assumption does not have project financing or equity partnership built into the assumptions. This is purely the timing of our on streams and the ramp up of those projects. So again, no project financing or equity partnerships built into those assumptions. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, John.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you Seifi. If I may, I wanted to ask also on Slide 21 and 22, you provide some detail regarding the future growth of clean hydrogen. I think the source of that is a Deloitte study from 2023. And so I'm curious, some of your peers inside and perhaps also outside the industrial gas industry have talked about some attenuation of timelines and some uncertainties on the regulatory and economic side. So my question would be, how does your internal view today compare with this forecast? Is it better or worse or perhaps similar if you look at it perhaps on a bottom up basis given your unique insights and conversations you're having all over the world. How would you describe that trajectory relative to the way it was in 2023?
Seifi Ghasemi: Again, an excellent question. We are actually, what we see is more bullish than what is on those slides and those projections. The reason is that, when you say other people, other people don't have anything to sell and as a result they are not engaged with the people who want to buy. I mean, why would anybody go and talk to one of our competitors when they don't have a plan? We are the ones who are engaged with real customers. So we have a much better view. This is one of the things about being the first mover. I mean, if you are a customer, if you are a steel plant, if you are a refinery and you want to make a commitment about going to green hydrogen, there is a hell of a difference between us sitting across the table with them and showing them a picture of NEOM rather than somebody saying that, well, I might have a project in Timbuktu that might produce green hydrogen in the future. So we have a much better visibility in terms of what the real demand is and what the real customers are talking about. So as I said, we are obviously very excited about the opportunities and we see that growing every day because more and more people are talking to us. I mean, right now we are in a position to send people to go visit NEOM. And once they visit, they are a lot more enthusiastic in talking to us than they were before. So we have put ourselves in a favorable position because we took the risk to be the first mover.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: Great, thank you. Good morning. First, Melissa -- good morning Seifi. You made a comment, Melissa, about a onetime asset sale benefit in America. Did I hear that correctly? And just how much of an impact was that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the impact wasn't that huge, but I like to turn that over to Melissa to qualify that. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you, Seifi. So Seifi is right. It was not material to our overall results. This is a normal cancellation of a project where we then sell the asset. So very immaterial to our overall results and something that is in the normal course of our quarter-to-quarter business.
Seifi Ghasemi: Melissa did a great explanation, if I may just add. It is not uncommon, and we have a long-term agreement with the customer. In the contact, the customer has an option to come and terminate the contract, pay us a cancellation fee, because they want to do something different with the asset. So this was a small refinery in Southern part of Texas, and that's what happened. It's not anything unusual as part of our normal course of business. Sorry, you had another question?
Michael Leithead: Yes. Seifi, I wanted to go back to World Energy I think you said in a prior answer that your relationship there is excellent. But there was a lawsuit that became public about 2 weeks ago that shows Air Products went World Energy, a good amount of money that World Energy has since defaulted on. So how do we square that?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is the normal course of business. It's a guarantee about certain payment it is insignificant, but it obviously does become public. And we obviously always protect our rights and so on, but that doesn't mean that there is a bad relationship between Air Products and World Energy. Just normal course of routine I can have Sean make a comment on that, if you want, Sean?
Sean Major: Thanks, Seifi. I think it's important that particular piece of litigation does not involve World Energy and our relationship with World Energy continues to be very strong and robust. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay.
Michael Leithead: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much. Any other questions, operator?
Operator: We do. We will go to Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, guys. First question is just around the Asia business. Price being down, -- is that more an indication of just what's happening generally supply/demand is a little bit out of whack? Or is that still the hangover from helium prices falling and hurting pricing overall in Asia?
Seifi Ghasemi: It is a combination of both of them. It is supply-demand and there is some impact on helium, because of the helium coming from Russia.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. Thank you. And then I just want to go back to the headcount comment you made. Again, headcount for you guys is up about 4,000 people in the last several years. And I just wanted to - so none of that headcount is really running through the P&L in the EPS that you guys delivered last year. All of that is basically being capitalized? Or is there some percentage split between what's being capitalized and what's running through the P&L.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, why don't I have a address that. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. No. Thank you, Seifi. So there are a good portion, because the vast majority of the growth was in our project delivery organization. So a large portion of that is capitalized. But obviously, there are portions of that that are part of a project development organization as well as support organization to really support the growth strategy. So the vast majority is in fact, capitalized, but there is a portion, obviously, for support. But I do also want to comment that we did take productivity actions over the last 2 years, reducing our head count by almost 1,000. So obviously, we are being diligent that when there are opportunities to reduce head count, we are strategically doing so. Thank you.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll move next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: So, good morning. One short-term question on the price - the merchant pricing that you're seeing in North America. What do you see - what are you using for next year's outlook as to how solid pricing will be? And kind of can you just elaborate on the dynamics there? And then secondly, you made a comment around how -- as the first mover, you're getting better contracts than you would expect to guess in the future. Can you unpack kind of some - or give some examples around that? Because I appreciate kind of the marketing angle of being able to show people you have the facilities first. Can you walk through kind of the contractual differences that - the opportunities that you've been able to capture that you would never get again?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for your question. With respect to our pricing assumption for 2025, that is a little bit of a forward-looking statement about pricing, and we usually do not do that. So if you forgive me, I cannot really answer that question because that's not appropriate for us to make comments about future pricing. With respect to the contracts, well, if we are the only people who are going to have green hydrogen available. By the time that people need to comply with the regulation within you think that we would be in a better shape to negotiate the contracts than somebody who might have something available in 2035. So I think being the first mover and having the product, please don't forget, nobody else in the world is going to have a green hydrogen at the quantities, commercial scale to decarbonize a refinery by 2030. Any new project requires permitting, plan. Those things take a long time. Believe me, we started on the project in Saudi Arabia and our green hydrogen projects in 2017, our project is going to come on stream in 2027. Takes us 10 years. It's a long process. That is what I was referring to about why we have an advantage.
Laurence Alexander: Perfect, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Thank you. Operator, we have time for two other questions, please.
Operator: We actually have one more question holding. We will go to Sebastian Bray with Berenberg.
Sebastian Bray: Hello, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I have two please. Have first is on the Middle East segment. Jazan, I think, was a bit shy -- the whole Middle East and India line was a little bit shy of consensus expectations. And I think this is the second time this has happened, has anything happened at Jazan that makes that business less profitable in 2024 than in previous years, has anything shifted in the contract? Is there anything else within EBITDA on line for Middle East and India that would explain that? And my second question is more philosophical. The company has costed up significantly with a lot of personnel to in-house expertise across the hydrogen chain. Carbon capture probably some terminal and transport as well. If I take the target for net cash flow positive by 2027. To me, that implies, okay, we do Neon Louisiana, but we don't necessarily do any other projects in the meantime in a big way. How is it going to be able to continue to use the expertise of all of these people? Or are they still focused on those two projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much I will answer the second question, and then I will turn it over to Melissa to answer your first question about the Middle East. With respect to your second question, I do not think that it is a correct assumption that we are doing 100% of what we are doing right now about NEOM and about Louisiana in-house. That is not a correct assumption. We are not experts in carbon sequestration. We are going to get people who are experts on that to engineer that. That's what they are doing. And to do that for us. We are not going to be designing Class 6 wells. I see that is the -- we have people who oversee the process. But we are going to go to people who are Board experts on these things, and they will do that for us. When it comes to some of the in engineering or the detailed engineering of some of these facilities, we are using some of the largest engineering firms in the world to do those. But we are keeping and what we have put together is the key people for the key technologies. I mean in NEOM, building the ammonia plant is not the key technology, building the solar plant is not the key technology or building the wind farm is not the core technology. The real expertise is how do you put these things together and run them simultaneously so that it works. That is the know-how that we have people and we are going to be very protective of that know-how. And then in Louisiana, we are doing some of the engineering, but not all of it. We do not haven't hired new people to start designing rebars for foundations. We are focused on the key technologies that enables the implementation of these products. So I just wanted to explain that. And now I'd like to turn it over to Melissa to answer your question about the Middle East. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Great. Thank you, Seifi. So just a couple of points on our Middle East and India segment. What you're seeing there is really a decline in our merchant demand, coupled with slightly down in pricing largely in the United Arab Emirates. As it relates to our Jazan joint venture, that is actually performing as expected. We are flat year-over-year, and we continue to see very good results in our Jazan joint venture. Thank you.
Sebastian Bray: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Operator, any more questions?
Operator: We don't. And Seifi, I would like to turn the conference back to any additional or closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Well, thank you. At this time, I would like to thank everybody for participating in our call. I appreciate you taking time to listen to our presentation, which was a little bit longer than usual. I appreciate that, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. And in the meantime, have a great day, good health and success. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-08-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Air Products Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar.
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Samira. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' third quarter 2024 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President, and CEO; Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Eric Guter, our Incoming Head of Investor Relations. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook, and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on slide number two. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to join our call today. Before I discuss our results, I would like to introduce Eric Guter, who is with us today. Eric has been with the company for nearly 30-years, most recently serving as our Vice President of Hydrogen for Mobility. He will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to Investor Relations. I'm happy that he has agreed to take on this new challenge. Eric, would you like to say a few words?
Eric Guter: Thank you, Seifi. I appreciate your kind words, and I'm humbled and honored to be part of this tremendous team and to be taking on this new role within Air Products. Looking forward to meeting with our analysts and investors and continuing the great work, Sidd and the team have done as we continue to execute our growth strategy.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Eric. And as we have announced, Sidd will be leaving the company to pursue other career opportunities. Sidd has made great contribution to Air Products. I want to thank him for continuing to build strong relationship with investors and analysts and for his work over the past few years at the company. Sidd and Eric are already working closely together to ensure a smooth transition. Now, please turn to slide number three. As always, I would like to begin with our record on safety, which is our top priority at Air Products. We have made significant progress on both our employee loss time, injury rate, and recordable injury rate since 2014. We are proud of this improvement and we are very proud to have the best safety record in the industry. But we always strive to achieve zero incidents and zero accidents. That is our ultimate goal. Slide number four summarizes our management philosophy. We have shared this with you many times before. We are, as we have been for the past 10-years, committed to these principles and practice them every single day. Now, please turn to slide number five. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.20 per share exceeded the upper end of our prior guidance range of $3 per share to $3.05 per share, and improved 7% over last year. Our results reflect strong underlying performance in the Americas and Europe. Additionally, we saw improvements across our organization, driven by our price and pr0oductivity actions. We continue to execute our two-pillar growth strategy, which includes driving operational excellence and growth in our industrial gas business, while executing our energy transition projects focused on clean hydrogen. Now, please turn to slide number six. We are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $12.20 per share to $12.50 per share. And we still expect our CapEx to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024. Now, please turn to slide number seven. During our fiscal third quarter, in addition to achieving 7% earnings per share growth, we have also reached overall significant milestones. In June, we announced a very large scale long-term green hydrogen supply agreement with TotalEnergies. Beginning in 2030, Air Products will supply TotalEnergies with 70,000 tons per year of green hydrogen for 15-years. This pioneering agreement, which has already generated significant interest from other customers validates our long-term strategy and demonstrates a strong demand for green hydrogen. We are seeing the development of significant demand for green hydrogen in Europe. And as a result, we are even more excited and committed to our strategy to be a pioneer in the production of clean hydrogen. In July, we announced the planned sale of our LNG process technology and equipment business to Honeywell for an all-cash price of roughly $1.8 billion. The divestment of this business will allow us to focus on our core business, while bolstering our balance sheet and our liquidity position. Also in July, we were pleased to announce our collaboration with Mercedes-Benz to help decarbonize the heavy transport sector. Air Products was among five other companies that took delivery of Mercedes-Benz's hydrogen fuel cell trucks. This is a significant milestone toward the eventual mass production of hydrogen fuel cell heavy-duty trucks. In a related development, we have also announced our plans to build a network of permanent commercial hydrogen fueling stations along the Trans-European Transport Network. Now, please turn to slide number eight, which illustrates our greater than 10% average growth rate for our adjusted earnings per share in the past 10-years. Our goal is to extend this trend for another 10-years, while remaining the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have done this before, and I'm confident we will do it again. Now, please turn to slide number nine. We take a balanced approach to determining our dividend. We are confident that our cash flows from operations and our ability to raise capital through financing and other strategic initiatives will allow us to continue rewarding our shareholders through increased dividend, while meeting the cash needs of our growth strategy. Now, turning to slide number 10, which as I always say, is my favorite slide. It shows that our EBITDA margins have significantly grown and now, it stands at 42%, leading the industry by far and demonstrating our persistent focus on effectively running our base business. We are very much focused on profitability, and this slide is a living proof of that. I want to thank all of our employees for delivering these outstanding results in very challenging economic conditions. At this point, I would like to turn it over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer to provide a summary of the third quarter financial and business segment results. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. Now, please turn to slide 11. Compared to last year, underlying sales, volume and price together were up 1% and positive across most reporting segments. The 2% reduction on the company's top line was primarily due to unfavorable currencies. On-site volume was again positive this quarter, driven by strong demand for hydrogen as well as contributions from new assets. However, overall volume was flat due to lower demand for merchant products. Overall price improved modestly at 1% with continued strong performance in the Americas, coupled with lower power costs, which improved contribution margin. Declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in 1% lower energy cost pass-through, which has no impact on profit. EBITDA of $1.3 billion increased 5%, primarily driven by positive contribution margin and favorable business mix. Although cost was moderately unfavorable, this with heavy planned maintenance this quarter, we are starting to see positive momentum on our productivity actions across the organization. ROCE of 11% was down 70 basis points and relatively flat sequentially. Adjusted for cash, our ROCE is about 12%. Sequentially, volume improved across the reporting segments. Now, please turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $3.20, up $0.22 or 7% compared to last year, mainly due to better operating results. Overall, volume was up $0.05 on higher on-sites, including new assets, partially offset by lower merchant demand. Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.16 this quarter, driven by both pricing gains and lower power cost. Costs were $0.04 unfavorable as productivity actions offset much of the costs related to planned maintenance and inflation. Again, we are making good progress implementing the productivity actions and exercising significant cost control throughout the organization. Currency was negative $0.04, mainly due to weaker currencies in Asia and South America. Additional debt contributed to higher interest expense of $0.03 and one-time items helped lower the effective tax rate this quarter. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be about 18%. Now, please turn to slide 13 for a discussion of our business segment results. Instead of viewing each business segment in detail, I would like to provide a focused discussion summarizing our segment results and highlighting key items for the quarter. You will find individual slides covering each of the business segments in the appendix. Looking at each business segment, Americas underlying sales were positive, with price and volume together up 2%. Merchant pricing was 7% higher, which resulted in a 3% overall price gain for the region. Volume was relatively stable as weaker merchant demand was offset by strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA increased 6% and EBITDA margin increased about 400 basis points, primarily driven by strong price, despite increased costs due to higher planned maintenance. Looking at Asia results, the region's underlying sales were relatively stable. Volume was down 1%, as lower demand for merchant products and planned maintenance outages were offset by new assets. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were unfavorable, primarily driven by the planned maintenance outages. Switching to our Europe segment, merchant pricing was held firm, and combined with our declining power costs in the region, drove improved contribution margin. Volume was up 1%, largely due to our new assets in Uzbekistan. EBITDA improved 12% and EBITDA margin increased nearly 500 basis points, mainly due to improved volume and contribution margin. Moving to our Middle East and India segment, sales and operating income declined due to unfavorable merchant price and volume. Equity affiliates’ income was 7% lower due to higher costs. For our corporate and other segment, sales and profit were up this quarter, primarily due to higher sale of equipment, including LNG. We're making good progress on our productivity actions across all segments of the company. Before I turn the call back to Seifi, let me take a moment to thank our teams around the world for delivering these outstanding results. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now, please turn to slide number 14. Our industrial gases business is a great business, and we are committed to invest and grow it. Our recent announcements to expand our membrane production facility in St. Louis and to build two new air separation units in Georgia and North Carolina are just the latest examples. We are also leading the way to deliver low-carbon hydrogen at scale to help decarbonize the industrial and heavy-duty transportation sectors of the economy. Our two-pillar growth strategy drives our company towards these two goals in parallel. The outstanding results and the significant project milestones that we were able to achieve this quarter demonstrates that we have the right strategy, and as I always say, we have the commitment and motivation of our employees to make it happen. Now, before I open it up for industrial -- for questions, I want to make some comments about our Management Board and succession planning. The formation of the Management Board was a strategic step to delegate more responsibility to our senior executives, who are close to the business. You have seen our public announcements and our 8-K filing on these organizational changes, and I don't really have any additional comments to make on them. On a personal basis, you all know that I am firmly committed to our two-pillar growth strategy and I have -- as I have articulated that many times. I fully intend to continue leading Air Products ensuring that our growth strategy is fully implemented, our mega projects are built, and we are serving our customers with low-carbon and zero-carbon hydrogen. However, with our continued commitment to good governance and succession planning, it is prudent and good practice to have a fully qualified individual who can be my successor if something unexpected were to happen to me. I currently serve in three roles at Air Products. Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President. With good governance in mind, I have decided to bring into the company a fully qualified potential successor as President and a Member of our Board of Directors. This person should be well-known to investors with a clear record of success, preferably a current or former CEO of a public company with significant international experience and relationships. I have started this process and we will take our time to find the right person for the job. At this point, I will be delighted -- we all will be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes. Good morning, Seifi, and thanks for all the color and on the -- and the commentary around the management committee. It's definitely helpful in terms of how to think about things going forward. So, I guess one of the things I wanted to dig into one of the newer, I guess, events that came up during the quarter was on the green hydrogen announcement with Total. It came -- admittedly, it came earlier than what we were thinking in terms of offtake arrangements. So, I guess, can you speak to, one, maybe what brought that forward or kind of brought the timing of it maybe a little bit earlier than expected? And then two, you spoke to kind of how that's heightened incremental demand for green hydrogen. Can you speak to that and maybe the potential for further offtake arrangements as we look out over the next 12 months or so?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Good morning, John, and thanks for the very good question. John, we have been talking to potential customers for hydrogen since even before we announced our project in New York, so, for the past five years. And with these things, they have a life of their own. The customers need to decide when they want to make a public announcement about having made a commitment. It depends on their needs. It depends on the regulatory conditions. It depends on conditions of the industry and all of that. And I'm very happy to see that a visionary leader like Mr. Patrick Pouyanne of Total decided to be the first mover and announced early that he is committed to green hydrogen and he is committed to convert at least his Northern refineries to hydrogen. Since we had been talking to him for a long time, it was not too difficult to kind of get our act together and put a contract together and make a commitment on both sides. We are obviously delighted. We could not have found a better customer or a better application for significant amount of hydrogen. In terms of additional volumes for them, I want to leave it to TotalEnergies to make those statements. I do not want to preempt anything. But what has happened since we have made the announcement, it has proven that people go through an auction process and then they find out that the best possible alternative is Air Products. So, a lot of other customers are taking the cue from TotalEnergy. Obviously, if they are going to convert their refinery to green, what are the other refineries going to do? They have to follow. So, we are being contacted by other refineries. We are being contacted by steel makers, who -- and now, it has become a little bit of a dynamic of, well, maybe we should get to Air Products before they run out of product, which obviously puts us in a very good position. In terms of future contracts and so on, I have always been very -- acting very responsibly, not to lead anything or give a hint until we actually do something. And I'd like to keep it that way. We are obviously working with other people. It is -- our intention is obviously to sell everything that we make. But if anything comes up at the appropriate time, we will make an announcement. But there is no question that the agreement with Total is a significant new beginning for us.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks. Thanks so much for the color. Maybe just as a follow-up, so can you give us an update on the progress that you're making with the Louisiana project? And I guess somewhat tied to the Total arrangement, it seems like if the market is opening up for green, I would imagine it's opening up even more quickly for what should be a more cost effective solution, which would be blue. So can you speak to maybe that dynamic as well?
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Again, another good question. Number one, our project in Louisiana, we call it the Dero project is moving very well. We feel very confident about the capital that we have announced. And I feel very good that we have done our homework, we have done the testing and all of that. And we filed last week our Class 6 permit to the State of Louisiana. That is a major -- minor -- milestone and the clock starts running in terms of getting approval for that, which is the most critical item for that project to be viable. We feel very good about the floor space that we have. We have proven that we have the floor space, which I think is a challenge for a lot of other people. And we are very confident that we should be able to bring that plant on the stream sometime in 2028. In terms of the demand for the product, you are right, there is a lot of discussions about the demand. And we have had discussions. The target for that product is two. Number one, the blue hydrogen, we are going to put it in our pipeline and serve our existing customers with blue hydrogen. And then a significant part of the hydrogen will be converted to ammonia for shipment to places like Japan and Korea to decarbonize their power plants. So, we feel very good about that. And if we have -- if we ever sign anything definitive, we will obviously be in a position to announce.
John McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color, Seifi.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Is the NEOM project still to come on stream at the end of calendar 2026? And what's the state of your hydrogen dissociation technology?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, good morning. Number one, our plants in NEOM is on a schedule. We expect that plant to be mechanically complete and hopefully commissioned by, as you said, December of 2026, and we should have product for sale in early 2027. In terms of the cracking technology, which I think is what you're referring to with the ammonia dissociated, we have proven that technology and we obviously will deploy it like in Total and in other places.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. When you -- when I look at Air Products' results, which I think are not dissimilar from what's happening with Air Liquide or Linde, there's been a slowdown in volume over time and there's also been a slowdown in price change. Now, it's hard to know whether raw materials have moved down and so, probably on-site prices have moved down, which in the end doesn't really matter very much. But can you talk about the sequential change in merchant prices and the overall volume slowdown in the industrial gas industry?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, I wouldn't say that we have an overall -- the reduction in industrial gases. Our merchant volumes in the U.S. is okay. And the place that when you look at overall at Air Products, where we are seeing a slowdown is obviously in China, and that affects our numbers. In terms of pricing, I can only comment on the past. I will not comment on the future, but obviously, when you increase prices, there comes a time where year-to-year, you don't show a huge amount of improvement, because there is a limit to what you can increase the price to because the people find alternatives and that there is a certain price at which you start being demand destructive. So, I feel very good about what our people have done with pricing and our overall volumes in the U.S. is good. In Europe, it's a steady, but it is weak in China. No question about that. We have talked about that. That was one of the principal reasons that we missed our estimate in the first quarter and -- but it has stabilized, but we are not seeing much growth in that part of the world.
Jeff Zekauskas: Great. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, Seifi. Wondering if you can give us an update on the sustainable aviation fuel project out in Los Angeles, both in terms of how the relationship with World Energy is going and the JV itself as well as the permitting process and sort of what your expectations are, if there's any update in terms of timeline or customers or just anything we should know incrementally there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Vincent. Yes, in terms of our relationship with TotalEnergies, we have a very good relationship with them. Obviously, we have been working with them for a few years. In terms of the status of the project, we have put that project on-hold until we get our permits. We always said that that would probably -- process will probably take a year and we still expect that. In terms of the demand for the product and all of that, SAF seems to be very much in demand. And as you have seen, Vincent I mean you're very well-informed, and a lot of people are trying to make SAF all over the world. So we just got a contract to supply hydrogen to a unit in Europe. So we feel pretty good about that project, but it is on-hold until we get our permits. And considering that we are operating in the State of California, we just have to wait-and-see how that works out.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And as a follow-up, the tax-rate in the quarter came in a little bit lower than we had expected. Should we assume that same tax rate in the fourth quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. I would like to turn that question to Melissa to give you a color on that.
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. I appreciate that. So for -- as we mentioned in the comments, we did see a lower tax-rate this quarter, but for the full-year, we do expect it to be at 18%. We had a number of one-time items that occurred this quarter. For example, there was a significant stock option exercise and some foreign restructuring, which did support the lower tax-rate. But again, 18% is what you should forecast for the year.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, David.
David Begleiter: Good morning. Do you have an update on the Alberta project as to when it will start-up and will contribute to '25 earnings?
Seifi Ghasemi: Our Alberta project will come on-stream sometimes in '25 and whether it will contribute to our fiscal year results, we have to wait-and-see exactly when that project comes on the stream. We are building a plant in the middle of Alberta, you know what the winters are like. So it's anybody's guess how much construction and how fast construction we can do during this winter. So I don't want to commit to any specific date. We are going to give you -- when we issue our guidance for the year, we are going to be conservative and assume no contribution from that project in '25.
David Begleiter: Understood. And just on the Q4 guidance, it is a bit wide. Why is it so wide and is what would cause you to come in at the higher-end or lower-end of the guidance range? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: David, you make a very good point. Number one, we didn't want to change the guidance for the year, quite honestly. So by default, you end up with the numbers that you have, because I thought if you start changing the guidance for the year, it might get misinterpreted. Because we either had to move the bottom-up or the top-down but there is good reason for the wide range, David. And you see the news, the geopolitical situation in the world is very unstable. We are going through an election cycle and the Federal Reserve hasn't made up their mind about exactly what they want to do. There is a lot of unknowns and therefore to try to kind of thread the needle and come up with a $0.05 range and so on, we did that last quarter because it was -- I was not as worried about the overall geopolitical situation as I am now. But overall, I think, you should focus, I would appreciate if you focus on the year guidance rather than just the quarter guidance. We are going to be somewhere between $12.20 per share and $12.50 per share, right.
David Begleiter: Understood. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Chris Parkinson: Great. Seifi, you've put together a couple of decent quarters, I should say, good between the US and Europe. And yet the macro, I think across all geographies has been fairly choppy and you've been navigating a lot of -- a lot of difficulties across-the-board and yet you're kind of moving in the right direction now. So can you just kind of give us a quick update on kind of some of the key things that you're seeing on a regional basis, specifically what's the latest in manufacturing and electronics, perhaps a little update on Helium in Asia. Putting everything together now that we are in a more favorable trajectory, I'd love to just hear your thoughts on entering 2025? Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Chris. That's an excellent question. Chris, on a macro basis, you know, I'm always an optimist and I'm generally optimistic. I think the U.S. economy has proven everybody wrong. It is moving stronger than quite honestly we expected. Our on-site volumes, especially hydrogen is very strong in the U.S. and the merchant business is doing fine. So, for the U.S., I feel very comfortable going into 2025 unless something significantly unexpected happens with the interest rates. And with the election, we all know what to expect. It's either one or the other. So I don't think that will change things that much. Then with respect to Europe, Europe is holding up relatively well. We have been successful in holding on to the price increases that is making sure that we have a good margins there. And then my only concern going into '25 is how would Asia develop? But considering where China is right now, I don't expect it to get any worse. Some people are predicting that the things will improve, especially in the electronics sector, as you mentioned but we will wait-and-see. So overall going into 2025, I'm very optimistic for sure about Air Products and in terms of our ability to deliver the growth that we in general want, which is 10% growth every year-on our EPS.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you for the color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fisher with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fisher: Yes, good morning, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Duffy, how are you?
Duffy Fisher: Good, thanks. If you could maybe talk us through what the economics look like for the two hydrogen stations that you called out, the one that you were going to do in Europe and then the one in California. Roughly how much capital is that? And then what's the business model there? Will you own the stations and then push your hydrogen through it or will other people own it and just source from you? I mean, just can you give us some rough scope of what that project looks like?
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Duffy, our intention is that we kind of go -- own the whole supply chain. We produce the green hydrogen, we move it, whether it's in form of liquid or in form of ammonia that we then crack. Then we build the station, we will own the station, we might own the station jointly with some other people, but we will have control over the station, and we will sell it to the end-customer to the truck company or the train company or anybody else. So we want to own the whole supply chain. And that is why in terms of economics, obviously, it depends -- the capital deployed, it depends on the number of stations we are going to build. That will be a gradual development depending on how much product we have and all of that. I mean, right now, we fully intend to build these stations in Europe and in California. But in Europe, if we sell-out NEOM all for application of decarbonizing refineries, then obviously, we will build a NEOM 2 and therefore building the stations will be a little bit delayed. And same thing in California. So it very much depends on how the market develops, but the idea is exactly what you said that we will either own their stations 100% or we share the ownership with Air Products in control, so that we make sure that our molecules are the molecules that are going through it. And if other people built stations, we might or might not sell them the molecules. It depends.
Duffy Fisher: Okay, great. And then for the second one, if I could, when we look at the sequential walk from Q3 to Q4, at the midpoint of the guide, it's up $0.28, but Melissa just talked about having a tax headwind sequentially that might be a nickel or a dime. Can you bridge us to getting, let's say, that $0.30 better in EPS going from Q3 and Q4, what drives that?
Seifi Ghasemi: And what drives that is, Duffy, that's obviously a very good question. What drives that is that number-one is, look, when you look at our results in the last 10 years or 15 years or 20 years, the fourth quarter of our fiscal year is one of our strongest quarters. It is not only one of, it is our strongest quarter. So we expect that we would have better results than the $3.20 just because of the cyclicality. The second reason is that we have taken serious productivity actions. You are seeing some of the results in this quarter, but you'll see a lot more of that in the next quarter. And then the third thing is that we do have some new smaller projects coming on-stream that will contribute. So we feel pretty confident that we should be able to, as you said, bridge that $0.30 and deliver the midpoint of what we have delivered $0.48 that we need to get to the midpoint of our guidance.
Duffy Fisher: Terrific. Thank you, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Salvator Tiano: Thank you very much. This Salvator Tiano filling in for Steve. So firstly, I want to go back a little bit to the Louisiana project where you mentioned you're still on track for a 2028 start-up. And you made the comment that blue ammonia would be sold to the export market for energy. However, it seems like companies such as some of the major Japanese utilities will probably not need that much ammonia, if any at all at that time, perhaps you have to wait two or three years. So is it safe to assume that you will not focus on ammonia till perhaps 2030 or are there any other outlets for that when you start-up?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you for your question. Obviously, we are hearing a different story from them. I don't know what they tell you, but they tell us there is a lot of demand. But there is also another sector that is developing pretty rapidly and that is ammonia for -- as a marine fuel for shipping. So we feel pretty confident that by 2028, we will be able to start loading that facility. We also have the capacity and capability of balancing between hydrogen and ammonia and we do have the pipeline and I think by 2028, a lot of our existing customers might want blue hydrogen instead of gray hydrogen.
Salvator Tiano: Perfect. And I wanted to go back a little bit to the World Energy Project. You mentioned that it's roughly a one year timeline to get the permits. I think the project itself was announced over two years ago. So is it safe to assume you didn't actually apply for permits till over a year-after that? And when is kind of the one year deadline that you kind of alluded to? And does this mean at that point, you're going to proceed with a final FID and we're going to -- we'll know if it's a go or no-go?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we hope that we get our permit and we hope to finish the plan. But we have to wait for the permits because we don't want to commit and then find out there is an issue with the permit or we have to wait some more. So I'm not sure if there is anything more for me to add, we are just waiting for the permit. And we don't want to hurry up like we did last-time and start getting ahead of ourselves and then finding that the permit gets challenged and all of that. We want to make sure that it is bullet proof before we have final FID decision.
Salvator Tiano: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Seifi, I wanted to ask on the Total green hydrogen agreement. I appreciate you likely won't talk about pricing. If you want to give us the agreed-upon price, I'd happily take it. But can you speak to the return hurdle of this agreement? You've obviously taken a lot of risk by being a first-mover. So in this validation, are you getting a return profile that is a materially above your traditional project hurdle?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, you know you're asking a very good question. Obviously, the answer to that is yes. But I hope you have some sympathy with me that we are negotiating with people to sell them something and you don't expect me to be sitting here on a public call saying, hey, we're going to make a lot of money, right? So we have to be cautious in terms of our comments. But you can be sure that as I have always said, we have taken the risk and therefore, the reward should be higher than what we do when we do things that are no-risk, not risky.
Mike Leithead: Makes a lot of sense. And then I think you've talked before about being excited about building, like you just said, NEOM 2 or other large clean-energy projects, but at the same time, you didn't want to commit to announcing much until you've signed tangible offtake agreements for what you already have out there. So now that we have the Total contract, it sounds like you're far along in some other negotiations. Should we expect further clean-energy project announcements in, say, the next 12 months or so?
Seifi Ghasemi: I did only commit to that if we have announced enough projects so that the investors see that we are sold-out. I don't want to say that, okay, we have sold 35% of NEOM, therefore, we should rush and go and build NEOM number two. I'd like to wait until we have sold 80% of NEOM and then commit to that. So we are going to be conservative and cautious and not to get ahead of ourselves. But the fact that we have demonstrated that there is significant volume demand is a good sign because until a few months ago, you have seen the slides from some of our competitors where they put it in writing that there is no demand for green hydrogen. So I think -- and now it's obviously a little bit of a different story. There is demand for green hydrogen. But I would like to give some confidence to the investors that we are truly have signed enough things that it is sold-out before we commit to additional projects. Depending on how fast those things come, you're right, it might be that in a year we will announce a new NEOM project, but it will depend on how fast we progress with signing contracts for the current production.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you so much. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter and outlook. Seifi when you think about '25, and I know it's a little bit early to give any specific outlook. How much earnings growth do you think will be anchored by your projects next year? And maybe any sort of color you can have in terms of how much that could help or kind of sort of support some earnings growth -- support earnings growth next year. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, good morning and thanks for your comment. It would be very difficult right now to give you details. We are going to give you all those details when we announce our fourth quarter results. But in general, I would like to say that Air Products, 10-years ago, we committed to delivering an average of 10% growth in earnings. And today, we are committing that for the next 10-years, we will do the same. So, our target, our goal, our challenge is to deliver at least a 10% growth for next quarter -- for next year. But we will -- obviously, we are going through the budgeting process. We have all of the details and then we'll give you a number when we announce our results in late October or early November.
Mike Sison: Great. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Operator And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. And best wishes, Sidd. Welcome, Eric and [Indiscernible] thanks for being the rock. Seifi, in your price discussions on clean hydrogen between Alberta, Louisiana, NEOM, I know you don't want to give any details, but is there a really wide range that you're seeing in terms of discussions with customers? And have they all been, I assume, above gray hydrogen plus the carbon credit?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. The guidance that -- the overall guidance that we have been telling people is if the gray price is something, the blue prices at least twice that and the green price is twice that. So it's double for blue and then double for green. And that is the kind of overall guidance for pricing. So I think you all have a pretty good idea of the kind of pricing that we are looking for and we are getting that. And I think that the pricing change will improve as we go-forward when the demand exceeds the supply.
John Roberts: And that's price at the customer receipt level and your netback pricing will be significantly different across the various customers because obviously some in Alberta are right next door and for NEOM, it's going to be pretty far away.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that there is some element of that, but we do take that into consideration when we give the pricing. I mean, if it's very difficult to serve a customer, then obviously the price will be significantly higher than , as you said, somebody is next door.
John Roberts: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi, good morning. So I wanted to follow-up on the question earlier around your commitment to announce additional projects. I think during the quarter, you've been more explicit that you won't FID, I believe, any projects until you get more offtakes. And I wanted to see how precise we should be taking that language. So you talked about NEOM earlier, but as we think about Louisiana, should we think about both of those need to reach 80% offtakes before you announce anything else or is your expectation to be looser than that?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think you should expect that we would kind of see our way of loading those three facilities that you talked about. NEOM, Louisiana and Edmonton fully-loaded before we make an FID for another project. There is one other project that we are working on, which is the project that we did announce, a green hydrogen project in Northern Texas. But that project, we have not taken FID. We do not plan to take any FID until we have total clarity on what the IRA rules are for interpretation of what is green hydrogen. So other than that, I don't expect us to make any announcements until we see our way very clearly. And this is quite frankly, a fundamental issue of being respectful to the investors. I think we announced many, many projects and the investors got very concerned and that is why, I mean, our stock should be $400 now and it is at, I don't know, $285 to $290, $300. But that the reason for that is that I think we got the investors a little bit concerned that we're getting ahead of ourselves. We didn't think so, but certainly the impression was with the investors that we are building plants without having a clue about where to sell it. That was never the case, but that was the impression. So I don't want to get into that mood again. We want to fully demonstrate that there is demand before we make any FID -- announce any major projects.
Josh Spector: Thanks. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up then on Texas, I guess, specifically, do you consider that a new project? So if we get IR clarity, IRA clarity in the next, I don't know, six, nine months, but Japan takes longer to say what their credits are going to be for blue hydrogen into utility, coal, energy production, is that something you would FID, that Texas project without that Louisiana project sold out or is the Louisiana project or whatever project sold out the limiting factor, in your view?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, the project in Northern Texas, and we can demonstrate to you that it is fully sold out in a few years because that project is directed at making liquid green hydrogen, liquid green hydrogen. And that is targeted for the market in California. We can easily transport that without any significant cost to California. And when you look at the demand in California for green hydrogen and the number of stations and so on, you can easily come up with the demand to fill that project up. The main reason that we're holding on that project is because we want to understand what is the definition of green and we know that we qualify to get $3. We want to see if other people qualify to get the $3 or not. But I am very confident about the very confident about the fact that we can sell that product for very good prices. Right now, we are selling green hydrogen into that market at close to $30 a kilogram, $30 a kilogram. And if you do the math, that makes everything you know. So the project in Northern Texas is very much we are waiting for the definition of the IRA. And as you said, I don't think we will have clarity on that until probably beginning of next year. So we are not going to do anything until then. Okay?
Josh Spector: Understood. Thank you. Yes, thanks, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Operator, do you have time for two other questions, please?
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe just wanted to follow-up, you mentioned the election multiple times. I just want to understand your latest and greatest thoughts on what either outcome might mean for the two pillars of your business? And then maybe more specifically what you think each outcome might mean for the interpretation of the IRA rules?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. I'm not sure I would have understood. Can you just hold on? Let me -- Sidd, can you?
Sidd Manjeshwar: Yes, I think the question was related to the IRA guidance and with the incumbents or a new administration coming in, what does that mean?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the IRA is as the part that is related to us, it has two dimensions. One dimension is the so called 45Q, which is that you get $85 per ton of CO2 that you sequester. I think there is not much controversy around that rule. No matter which administration you have, I think that will get support and that is why we are building the project in Louisiana, we feel very confident about that. The challenge is on the other part, which is called 45V, which is the $3 subsidy for green hydrogen. And the controversy is very simple. What is the definition of green hydrogen. Is it enough to say, oh, I connected to the grid, I'm getting electricity, I'm breaking down water and therefore, I'm making green hydrogen and therefore give me the $3 irrespective of the fact that I might be using the electricity that is made by burning coal. That is the controversy. Obviously, Air Products' position has been crystal clear from day one that we believe that green hydrogen means that you are using green electricity. If you are not using green electricity, then it is not green hydrogen. And green electricity should also be available 24 hours a day. That means you need to prove that every hour you have green electricity. You can't make a lot of green electricity during the day that the sun shines and then say, okay, now in the night, I'm going to connect to the grid. So we have been very clear with our three pillars and that is what we think is the definition of green. The administration, the current administration has agreed with us. That is the way they have issued the rules that are public right now. The issue is they have not finalized the rules. And from what I hear, they are saying they are not going to finalize the rules until after the election. So, the issue is, if they have a change of administration, would the new administration see those rules as good or bad or do they want to modify? And we are not going to go and commit billions of dollars building a facility not knowing what the exact interpretation is. So we are going to wait until we have rules that have been approved, Press and the Treasury Department that we can certainly count on and then we will proceed. Sorry for the long answer, but I just wanted to address the whole issue.
Patrick Cunningham: No, thank you so much, Seifi. I'll leave it there.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Okay, operator, last question please.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take the last question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Rizzo: Hi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Lawrence. Thank you for fitting me in. And I'm sorry if I missed this, but, but have you provided an update on the status for the hydrogen project in upstate New York? I don't remember that being mentioned recently.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, we are building a green hydrogen project in upstate New York. We are using hydropower to -- hydropower is green power. And the capacity of that plant is not huge. It's a small plant, 35 ton a day. And the reason we have put it in that part of the world is because we obviously could get the power from Niagara Falls where it is coming from. And we see significant demand for mobility. We are going to produce liquefied green hydrogen and we see significant demand for that in that part of the world because by being in Messino, we can serve all the way to Pennsylvania, New York and all of that. And therefore, we are very optimistic about that project. That project is moving forward and it is on-time.
Dan Rizzo: And I'm sorry, just remind me when coming online?
Seifi Ghasemi: In terms of the timing, I think we have said sometime in '27, or '28. '27.
Dan Rizzo: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Well, thank you very much, and thank you, operator. And we thank -- I'd like to thank everybody for joining our call. We do appreciate your interest in Air Product. And we do appreciate your very good and insightful questions. Please be safe, stay healthy, and we look forward to talking to you when we announce our fourth quarter results. Thanks again, everybody.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-04-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.
 Beginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar, please go ahead. 
Siddharth Manjeshwar: Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' second quarter 2024 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.
 Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide #2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.
 Now with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. As you know, I always start with safety, which is our top priority at Air Products. Slide #3 includes our employee lost time injury rate and recordable injury rates in the first half of fiscal year 2024. Both of these rates were at their lowest levels since 2014 and the best in the industry. This is great progress, but our ultimate goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents.
 Slide #4 outlines our management philosophy. We believe strongly in these principles, and they will continue to guide us as we move Air Products forward like we have done in the past 10 years.
 Now please turn to Slide #5. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.85 exceeded the upper end of our previous guidance range and improved 4% compared to last year on strong results in Americas and Europe. We continue to effectively manage our current business while simultaneously executing our growth projects. We are focused on reducing costs and improving pricing in this inflationary environment. Our industrial gases business and broad scale low-carbon hydrogen projects are driving sustainability, enabling customers to decarbonize and generating a cleaner future for our world.
 Now please turn to Slide #6 for a review of our third quarter and full year guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $3 to $3.05. Our earnings are generally higher in the second half of our fiscal year. We are maintaining our full year guidance of $12.20 to $12.50 per share as we continue to monitor economic uncertainties, including China's economy and activities in the electronic industry throughout Asia. We continue to expect our CapEx to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024.
 Now please turn to Slide #7. Our adjusted earnings per share has improved an average of more than 10% annually since 2014, a trend we are committed to continue.
 Now please turn to Slide #8. We take a balanced approach to determine our dividend, considering various factors including yield, payout and peer benchmarks while investing for growth and maintaining our A/A2 credit rating. In January, we again increased our dividend to $1.77 per share per quarter, extending our record of 42 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2024.
 Slide #9 shows our EBITDA margin trend, always my favorite slide. Our margins have again climbed above 40%, leading the industry and reflecting our commitment to creating shareholder value. At this point, I would like to remind our shareholders that almost 10 years ago, on my first call as Chairman and CEO of Air Products, I promised you that we would make Air Products the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, and we have delivered on that. On the same call 10 years ago, I also promised we would increase our earnings per share on the average by 10% every year. And as you see on Slide 7, we have delivered on that too for the last 10 years.
 So today, I want to set the goal for the next 10 years. Air Products will continue to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world and, as we have done before, deliver earnings per share growth of at least 10% per year on the average for the next 10 years. We have done it before, and we will do it again. I have total confidence, and I want to stress this, I have total confidence in the ability of the talented, dedicated, motivated and committed people of Air Products to execute our bold and forward-looking strategy and deliver significant value to our shareholders. I want to thank every one of them for their hard work, commitment and dedication. I'm very proud to be part of this team.
 Now I would like to turn the call over to Melissa, our Chief Financial Officer, to make remarks about the second quarter. Melissa? 
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our second quarter results. Compared to last year, on-site activities were robust driven by higher demand for hydrogen and contributions from new assets. The volume was down 2% primarily due to lower demand for merchant products. Price contributed 1%. The combined impact of pricing and lower power costs across most regions resulted in strong contribution margins. The declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in lower energy cost pass-through, which has no impact on profit but contributed to higher margins.
 EBITDA improved 4% as higher contribution margin and lower costs more than offset lower affiliate income. EBITDA margin exceeded 40%, with lower energy cost pass-through contributing about half of the nearly 500 basis point improvement. ROCE of 11% was relatively flat. Adjusted for cash, our ROCE would have been about 13%. Sequentially, results improved driven primarily by favorable pricing and lower costs despite the seasonal slowdown due to the Lunar New Year in Asia and planned maintenance outages.
 Now please turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $2.57, which included a $0.20 charge for productivity actions. Our adjusted earnings per share was $2.85, up $0.11 or 4% compared to last year, primarily due to favorable pricing and costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume and equity affiliate income.
 Overall, volume was down $0.07 on lower merchant demand and planned maintenance outages. Price, net of variable cost contributed $0.16 this quarter driven by both pricing actions and lower power costs. Other costs were $0.12 favorable, demonstrating the team's commitment to managing costs, while we continue to support our growth strategy. Currency impact was negative $0.03, mainly due to a weaker Chinese RMB. Equity affiliate income was $0.08 unfavorable, driven by lower contributions from affiliates in Europe and the Middle East, partially offset by higher income in America.
 We successfully issued $2.5 billion of green bonds in February to help fund our growth projects. This additional debt contributed to higher interest expense of $0.07. The remaining items, including favorable noncontrolling interests, the tax rate and nonoperating expense together had a positive $0.08 impact.
 To echo Seifi's statement, I would like to express my appreciation to the entire Air Products team for their commitment to our company. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan. 
Samir Serhan: Thank you, Melissa. Please turn to Slide 12 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, underlying sales were positive with price and volume together up 4%. Merchant pricing was 6% higher, which corresponded to a 3% overall price improvement for the region. Volumes grew 1% as a strong demand for hydrogen more than offset weaker merchant volume. EBITDA was up 15% driven by higher price, volume and equity affiliates' income. Of the 1,000 basis point improvement to the EBITDA margin, roughly half was attributable to lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, EBITDA was 5% higher, mainly due to higher price and equity affiliate income.
 Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Asia segment results. Compared to last year, volumes were roughly flat as higher on-site volumes, including new assets were offset by lower demand for merchant products while price remained stable. As Seifi mentioned, we continue to see challenging economic conditions in China. However, we are beginning to see some potential improvement in the electronics market. Currencies were up -- were 4% unfavorable, primarily attributable to the weaker Chinese RMB. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were unfavorable, primarily driven by business mix. Sequentially, volume was 2% lower due to the Lunar New Year slowdown. However, EBITDA was flat as a result of lower cost and higher equity affiliate income.
 Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of our Europe segment results. Sales declined 11% compared to last year with lower energy cost pass-through and volume shortfall each contributing about half of the total. Weaker merchant demand and planned maintenance outage drove lower volume, partially offset by contribution from our Uzbekistan project. Merchant pricing was stable, and combined with declining power cost, it drove improved contribution margin. EBITDA was up 5% as the improved contribution margin and lower cost more than compensated for lower equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin improved over 600 basis points. Approximately half of this was due to the impact of lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, results were stable as favorable contribution margin and cost offset the planned maintenance volume impacts and lower equity affiliate income.
 Now please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Despite lower sales volume, operating income improved compared to last year due to lower costs. Equity affiliate income from the Jazan joint venture was lower due to higher interest and other operating costs.
 Please now turn to Slide 16 for our Corporate and Other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Sales were down primarily due to lower non-LNG sale of equipment activities. However, lower cost and contribution from LNG resulted in a stable EBITDA. Our activities related to the LNG equipment and technology business are robust, and we expect our LNG-related projects to improve the results of this segment moving forward.
 Before I turn the call back to Seifi, I also would like to say thanks to our teams around the world. We're continuing to improve our results. Now I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #17, Air Products has a great business model and continues to operate from a position of financial strength. While we execute our bold growth strategy in this challenging and continuously changing macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, our organization must remain flexible and agile. On a daily basis, our employees are committed to taking action that improves our safety performance, simplifies work and reduces costs so that together we can deliver productivity to the bottom line and continue to earn the right to grow as we pursue our strategy.
 We appreciate the dedicated service of all the people who are contributing to Air Products' success and the people in our leadership who continue motivating and developing our people. As I always say, our real competitive advantage is the degree of motivation and commitment of the people in the company. I am honored every day to be working alongside this team as we focus on delivering near-term results while executing our long-term growth strategy.
 At this point, we obviously will be delighted to answer your questions. Operator, we are ready for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. 
John McNulty: So I think the first one is just on how you're thinking about the cadence of the earnings as it progresses through the year. Obviously, 2Q came in pretty solidly, 3Q, maybe a little bit below what we and the Street were looking for, which kind of makes for a really steep ramp in the fourth quarter. I guess, can you help us to think about what drives that ramp, whether it's some of the projects or the Corporate line coming off, I guess, can you help us to think about the cadence for the year? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: John, excellent question. I would like to answer it in the following way. First of all, there is a question about the -- our guidance for the quarter. The guidance for the quarter is a little bit lower than what people expect. And that is because we have some major turnarounds that we have to do on our plants in Europe and in the United States that is driving our maintenance costs for the quarter, and that is why we have given a lower guidance than what we would have liked to do. So that is the -- for the third quarter.
 As far as -- we are committed to the year, because in the fourth quarter, although it looks like [ hardly a stake ], we expect to bring significant number of smaller plants onstream. We've brought in about 20 of them in the last -- in the first half, and we expect to have a number of clients coming onstream that will contribute.
 Secondly, we have taken significantly productivity actions that should result in better numbers for the fourth quarter. In addition, as you know, our business is seasonal, and the fourth quarter is just about every year our strongest quarter. And the fourth thing is that we are seeing a very strong performance by our LNG business and a lot of that will ramp up in the fourth quarter. So those are the fundamental reasons, John, I hope that answers your question. 
John McNulty: Yes. No, that's hugely helpful. Yes, it definitely helps to bridge in a reasonable amount. And I guess, maybe to that, as the follow-up or my second question, you had alluded to in some of the prepared remarks cost reduction actions and things that were starting to help on the margin side. And then -- and actually just in your last answer, you gave maybe -- you intimated that there's there is some help there. I guess can you help us to think about some of the actions that you're taking and if it's any specific division or how we should be thinking about that. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: We look at the company across the board. And by productivity we mean that we try to do things in a more efficient and more simplified way, which means that we don't have as many costs. That is the action that is normal for productivity. It just means that you are trying to do more with less -- with the same number of people you have or with less people. So those are the specific actions we have taken. 
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: In the Louisiana project, you'll bring on 3.5 million tons of ammonia. Some consultants think that the Japanese market is only 3 million tons of ammonia by 2030. Your competitors have begun to have memorandum of understanding and procuring volume. When your plant comes on in 2027, is there 3.5 million tons of demand for blue ammonia? And where might it come from? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Jeff, very good question as usual. Jeff, first of all, the number that you're saying, 3.5 million tons of ammonia, that assumes that we will take all of the hydrogen that we produce at that plant, all of the deep blue hydrogen that we produce will be turned into ammonia. That is not necessarily the case. As you know, we have a huge pipeline that goes all the way across the Gulf Coast of the United States. There is significant demand for blue hydrogen, for real blue hydrogen, not fake blue hydrogen. And therefore, we expect that a significant amount of the hydrogen we produce will be used as hydrogen through our pipeline to serve the customers that we have because they would be in need of that.
 So the breakdown of the ammonia and hydrogen is not finalized yet. We are installing 2.8 million tons of capacity to make ammonia. So that is the maximum amount of ammonia that we will be making. But we might make less than that depending on what we do with the hydrogen.
 So then the question that you have is, okay, even at 2.8 million, whatever you make, where is it going to be used? I understand that people are making -- announcing letters of intent and all of that. But that is people who don't have a product, selling it to people who don't have a use for it. There is -- we are making real blue ammonia, real blue ammonia, 95% of the CO2 taken. We have a place to sequester that. Therefore, our project is real. We are not having an imaginary or a fake project here. And therefore, we believe strongly that there will be demand for the product.
 Where it is going to go, we have always said that it is going to go mainly for decarbonization of the power plants in Japan and in Korea. But another significant demand that is being developed, and I think there are significant signs that, that is real, is ammonia as a fuel for ships. I'm sure you're familiar that starting January of 2025, in 6 months, every ship that goes to Europe, no matter where it starts from, if it gets to a port in Europe, they have to pay a tax on this carbon emissions that they released since they left their port of origin. We believe this will generate significant amounts of interest in ammonia as a direct fuel for ships. And you can check that people have already ordered ships that will use ammonia as a fuel, and some of them will actually be on the water in 2026.
 And the other thing that I'd like to just stress, we have not said that our Louisiana plant in terms of timing is going to be fully commissioned and onstream in 2028. Okay, Jeff? 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. And then for my follow-up, the -- in the quarter, what seems surprising was the weakness in equity affiliates' income in Europe and in the Mid-East. And in the script, there was some talk of higher interest costs in the Mid-East. And it's difficult to know if that's a onetime event or if that's a sustainable event. Could you comment on that?
 And I think European volume was down 6% in the quarter and maybe in the previous quarter, it was up 9%. And maybe if you can touch on what caused that change. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Okay. I will try to have Melissa answer the -- I got excited, I lost my voice, Jeff. But I'd like Melissa to answer the first question and Dr. Serhan to answer the second question. Melissa? 
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you, Seifi. So Jeff, what you're seeing in equity affiliate income is a little bit of timing, but we did see a bit of a decline in our Jazan joint venture. This is really a onetime item from the previous year and some higher interest expense for this quarter. So again, it's primarily timing, not an underlying business issue and a prior year onetime issue. 
Samir Serhan: And just following up on Jazan, I mean, again, Jazan is delivering $1.35 for earnings per share, and we expect really the project to continue to deliver this amount on an annual basis. I mean, there will be some seasonality depending on operating cost, maintenance.
 When it comes to the volume in Europe, the volume is lower because of the planned maintenance outage we had in the second quarter and a significant outage for our air separation units and SMR in the Rotterdam area. So that really drove the volume down and also what we highlighted before, the weaker merchant volumes in general, especially the liquids. The Uzbekistan project continue to ramp up, and that definitely helped in this area. So... 
Operator: We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. I'm sorry. We'll go next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. 
Steve Byrne: Just curious about the business mix that was unfavorable in Asia. Was that primarily helium? And can you provide an update on how that business is going in Asia? Are you adjusting to the Russian source product coming in, in your outlook in the next couple of quarters? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you for the question. We are adjusting -- I think that's a very good word. We are adjusting to the helium condition -- business conditions in China. And that situation has stabilized, and we expect a stable situation on that for the balance of the year. 
Steve Byrne: And a question about the Alberta project. Are you still expecting that blue hydrogen project up there to start up sometime in late 2025? And just curious, how much of the volume of that plant would you say has now been committed? Can you provide any update on that? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: The answer to your -- first part of your question is yes. And the second part is that I would like to say, that's just about all of it. 
Steve Byrne: And you have contracts on that, Seifi? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: We believe that we'll [ be all sold ] up. We do have it, okay? Thank you. 
Operator: We'll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. 
David Begleiter: Seifi, on NEOM, have you signed any offtake agreements for any portion of the production from that project? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: David, no, we have not signed any contracts that we are in a position to announce for that project yet. 
David Begleiter: Understood. And the same question for Louisiana. Has any portion of that contract been contracted for? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Not yet. And we have been very specific about this thing. That is not by accident. That is by design. We are not going to sign any contract for either 1 of these 2 projects until we get to the stage that we can get the price that we expect. We have taken the risk of being the first mover in this area of green and blue, and therefore, we deserve returns which are more than a plain vanilla, going and building an air separation unit. So we are going to wait until we can extract the right price. 
Operator: We'll go next to Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. 
Patrick Fischer: First question, just on Europe. Could you take out the Uzbek impact and just let us know what volumes did in Europe excluding that? And then what was the split of that number between your turnarounds and the weak merchant business? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: All right. Duffy, you know that that's a very detailed question and very sensitive competitively. But I'll turn it over to Dr. Serhan to see what he wants to disclose. 
Samir Serhan: Yes. I would emphasize what you mentioned, Seifi. We would really not like to get into those details. I mean... 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you. That's the right answer. Absolutely. Sorry, Duffy. Another question... 
Samir Serhan: But we've highlighted before that the Uzbekistan project is expected to really produce around $0.35 per year of earnings. 
Patrick Fischer: Okay. And then the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP, there's $0.20 of charges that are called out as business and asset actions. Can you detail what exactly those are and call out a few of the bigger items to that number? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Melissa, do you want to answer that? 
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure, Seifi, sure will. So thanks for the question. So as we mentioned, we continue to focus on our cost productivity and have taken discrete actions that are reflected in that business and asset action line item. For the vast majority of these, that is severance costs that we're recognizing in that $0.20. And just for your awareness, the full year run rate of that savings is about $75 million. 
Operator: We'll go next to Michael Leithead with Barclays. 
Michael Leithead: Great. First question for Seifi. I think this morning, the European Commission announced the first winning bids for their green hydrogen subsidy auction. I think most of the winning bids were under $0.50 per kilo of hydrogen. I guess, does that outcome surprise you at all? Would you have expected higher subsidy bids? Or just -- is that roughly consistent with the bidding activity you would have expected? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: I have no idea what you're talking about in terms of $0.50. It is impossible to have $0.50 hydrogen. To make hydrogen, you make -- you must have the unit -- to make hydrogen, you need about at least 50 to 60-kilowatt hours of power, and even the cost of power at $0.05, that's $3 a kilogram for hydrogen, excluding your capital costs and excluding your running costs. So I'm not familiar with that number. I don't know what you are referring to. 
Michael Leithead: Apologies. I was referring to the European Union's European Hydrogen Bank auction results this morning, referring to kind of the bid prices that were awarded to 7 different projects under $0.50 per kilogram of what they were awarded in terms of subsidy. But again... 
Seifollah Ghasemi: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Now I understood your question. Yes. They are -- those are not that they are buying hydrogen at that price, sorry, about that. They are giving subsidies for people to use hydrogen. Some countries are giving $0.50 a kilogram. Some countries are giving as high as $8 a kilogram. It depends on the country, and it depends on which tranche and all of that. But whatever subsidies they give, it's welcomed because that encourages use. My apologies at the beginning, I thought that they were buying hydrogen at $0.50. No, no, those are subsidies in terms of -- yes. 
Michael Leithead: No worries. Then again, it came out this morning. So I know it's a quick... 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Yes. 
Michael Leithead: And then second question related to Jazan, maybe for Melissa. Can you just remind us, again, you've talked about the EPS impact. But can you just remind us on the cash portion, are you receiving cash commensurate with your earnings per share? Or how should we think about the cash from the joint venture relative to the EPS impact? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Melissa, you want to go ahead and answer that? 
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, I sure will, Seifi. So yes, we do get regular dividends from the joint venture in commensurate with the earnings. Sometimes in our cash flow statements, you will see a little bit of timing of when those distributions do occur. But yes, absolutely, we are getting the dividends as expected. 
Operator: We'll go next to Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. 
Marc Bianchi: On the earlier discussion around Louisiana, Seifi, you mentioned that there'll be a market for your blue hydrogen into the pipeline network. Investors have asked if that could cannibalize some of your existing gray hydrogen volumes. Can you talk about how we should think about that dynamic? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, it will eventually cannibalize that because I think, eventually, everybody will be using blue hydrogen. I mean, 10 years from now, I don't think anybody will be using gray hydrogen. So -- but the thing is that we expect volumes to grow. The volumes, as you saw even this quarter on our pipeline system is, we are totally sold out. And if we had any more hydrogen today, we could sell it. So we expect that there will be significant growth in addition to what is in the pipeline. And in the long term, we are going to make only blue hydrogen. I mean, 15 years from now, we will not have any SMRs running. 
Marc Bianchi: Okay. And Dr. Serhan made a comment in your prepared remarks about the electronics market outlook. It sounded like maybe looking a little bit better. I was hoping you could expand on that and maybe help us understand how much your earnings are being held back by that. So once the electronics market recovers what sort of uplift in EPS should we expect? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Dr. Serhan, you want to comment on that? 
Samir Serhan: Yes. We do see signs of the electronic businesses picking up, but really, we're not counting on any of that upside in our outlook for the second half of the year. So we're being conservative in this regard. But we do -- especially in Asia, I mean, with our major customers, their volumes are picking up across nitrogen, argon, helium, especially helium. 
Operator: We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Andrews: And I apologize. I fell off the call before. So if this has been asked, please move on. Seifi, I wanted to ask you, you did better in the second quarter. You were above the high end of your guidance. It seems to me that maybe that was a function of costs coming in on the power, and maybe nat gas side, a little bit lower than maybe what you thought 3 months ago. So one, is that the case?
 And then two, just given those costs have indeed come down, whether it was more than you expected or not. But how are you thinking about that on a go-forward basis? Just because we've seen price be nicely sticky despite the deflationary environment. And obviously, many things can happen that could cause those costs to go back up. So if they do go back up, do you think you'll be able to reprice for it? Or should we just assume that there could be a little bit of a give back over the next, let's say, 12 months if we do see some reflation. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Vincent, the thing is that your comment about our second quarter coming out better than we expected is because obviously we have taken -- we are seeing better volumes in U.S. and Europe. U.S. and Europe were very strong for us in the quarter, which was not what we expected. So that was the good news. The addition is that we are taking cost actions.
 In terms of pricing, I think that right now, with the inflation the way it is, I'm sure everybody is paying attention that consumer price index is up 30% in the last 4 years. So we are having serious inflation, and that is giving us the ability to go to the customers and ask for higher prices. And as you saw in the U.S., our merchant pricing was up 6% in the quarter versus quarter of last year. So we -- as I've said in my prepared remarks, our focus is on two things: cost, pricing. Those are the things that affects our short-term results and obviously executing our projects.
 But we have always -- in the last 10 years, Vincent, you know us very well, we have always reacted to the environment. As I said in my prepared remarks, these are the times when the organization needs to be very agile. And that's what Air Products is about. We can adapt. We are not very big, but we can adapt. I mean, as they say, the dinosaurs died. They were very big, but they were not agile and they are extinct. So hopefully, we are the agile ones who are going to survive for the long term, no matter what. 
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. 
Kevin McCarthy: Seifi, congratulations for the results that you outlined over the last decade, and it's nice to see the 10% earnings growth goal moving forward. Unfortunately, one thing that has changed over the last 15 months or so is Air Products' trading multiple of EBITDA. And so I'm wondering, to the extent that the company's hydrogen projects and investor anxiety around that issue may be weighing on the multiple, might Air Products be interested in establishing a market value for its hydrogen business through an IPO and/or a spin-off, for example? Is that something you would consider, if not today, then perhaps in 2025 or '26 when we move closer to sustaining cash flows from the various project startups? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Kevin, Air Products is right now involved in not only trying to deliver short-term results that meet the expectations of our investors and our own goal of 10% per year increase and, at the same time, executing $20 billion of projects. I don't think this is the time to try to do any kind of a financial engineering and all that because that would be significantly distracting to the management and to our people. We should continue doing what we are doing. And when the investor anxiety has disappeared once we have signed 20-year, 30-year contracts for the 2 big projects that we have underway. And once our hydrogen business, blue and green hydrogen business becomes reality and produces EBITDA and producers returns and all of that, that is at the time that one can talk about those kind of things. This is not the time.
 So right now, trying to put any value on the hydrogen business, it all depends on what is the assumption on the price of blue hydrogen and price of green hydrogen. And you talk to people. Some people say green hydrogen is worth $5, some people say it's $10, blue hydrogen the same thing. And obviously, we have other people, our competitors running around and saying, "Well, there is no demand for these things anyway." So how would you value a business like that? I would be very concerned about any effort in that direction because of the distraction that it will cause with especially the management and the team.
 So as they say, there is a time for everything. This is not the time for doing that kind of financial engineering on Air Products. And by the way I did obviously read your thoughtful memo on this. Appreciate that. 
Kevin McCarthy: And I appreciate the feedback regarding timing, hence my reference to future years. But perhaps to follow-up on the logic, if I may. It sounds as though the game plan is to enter into multi-decade long-term contracts and with greater clarity on counterparties and terms, perhaps the pressure on the multiple will be alleviated, as I understand what you're saying.
 And so I guess a follow-up would be, what is the timeline that you have in your mind to lift the veil and put forth these sort of agreements to the Street? Is it 6 months or 24 months or some other period of time? How would you think about starting that disclosure process? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, Kevin, this is a very fluid situation. It can be any time. It depends on -- as I said, our criteria is not to run and announce something so that the stock would go up $50. Our criteria is how do we extract the real value that we deserve for these projects for the next 30 years? That is our criteria.
 And now if somebody steps forward and say, "Gee, I'm going to start paying taxes tomorrow in 2027, in 2028 because of the regulation. And I desperately need this stuff and I want to secure it before somebody else does it, and I want to sign a contract 3 months from now." We'll do that. If it is 20 months from now, then we'll do it 20 months from now. These clients are not coming onstream until 2027, 2028. The part that I can confidently tell the investors, believe me, there is demand. Do not buy into this business that there is no demand. There is demand.
 The issue is at what point in -- and not only there is demand, but Air Products is the only company who is going to have real products being made. We have a real green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia being built. I can show you the picture of the wind turbines installed. Nobody else has that. Therefore, 3 years from now when people need this product, where are they going to get it? Therefore, we having taken the risk and losing a lot of the, as you said, our market value because we have taken the risk, we deserve a better return on these projects than running around and trying to panic about the fact that our multiple is, instead of being a 30x EPS, it is 20x EPS. But the value of the company hasn't changed.
 Our base business is the most profitable with the highest margin business than anybody else. So if anybody's business is trading at 30x, ours should be trading at that, too. And now people are worried about these big projects. There is demand. Please take a look at the regulations in Europe, regulations at California, take a -- regulations that are coming in Japan, Korea. There is demand.
 So it is obviously a great deal of pressure, but I am absolutely willing to stick my neck out and take the heat because I think my job is to create long-term value for shareholders, not try to panic on a short-term basis. Sorry for the long answer to your question. 
Operator: We'll go next to Patrick Cunningham with Citi. 
Patrick Cunningham: You cited major turnarounds in Europe and Americas potentially dragging on 3Q. Can you give us a sense of the volume and margin impact and what are those turnarounds there? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Dr. Serhan, you want to take that? 
Samir Serhan: Can you please repeat the question again, if you don't mind... 
Patrick Cunningham: Yes, on the major turnarounds in Americas and Europe. 
Samir Serhan: You're talking about the third quarter? Yes. I mean, we have 3 major turnarounds basically in the Americas in the third quarter. And that's why really our maintenance expense for the quarter is pretty significant. And they're also finishing a major turnaround in Europe, that's also going to contribute to basically significant increase in our maintenance costs for the third quarter. And these are mainly for like hydrogen plants... 
Patrick Cunningham: Got it. And then do you have an update on permitting and preliminary engineering for the North Texas project? And when do you anticipate FID there? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: I'd like to take that. We have done a significant amount of engineering on the North Texas project. But we are not going to make a commitment on FID on that project until the rules for the implementation of IRA are finalized. There is a significant impact. And as you know, there is significant amount of controversy about how those rules should be interpreted.
 Currently, the way the rules have been stated, they are fine with us. And if that was final thing, we would commit to FID. But they are not finalized yet and we expect those to be finalized by June, July. But we will wait. We are not going to make FID on that project until those rules of what is the definition of green hydrogen is final on the books and on which basis one can count on the tax credit. 
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. 
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Can you just quickly take us for a trip around the world in terms of the merchant operating rates and what you're seeing? I think those on the Street are hearing a few varying kind of takes on what's happening with the global economy. So we'd love to hear yours. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Chris. If I may just -- in general terms, China has been weak for us in the first half. Right now, there is stock. We haven't seen any evidence yet. But there is stock and some actions taken that might indicate that China's economy will improve in the second half. We are waiting to see that, and we have not included any improvement on that in our forecast.
 When it gets to Europe, Europe is no change in the -- as compared to the last few quarters. Actually, European economy is growing a little bit better than we expected, as I said before. And the U.S. economy is doing better than we expected. And then Latin America is not material to our business. I hope that covers what you were looking for, Chris. 
Christopher Parkinson: Sure. And just a quick follow-up, just given all the puts and takes, I'm sure you've seen, but in various public appearances, a lot of your competitors and peers, whether it's been Exxon or Shell or Aramco or Total, they've had, let's just characterize it as a very mixed commentary on a lot of the initiatives that you've been saying -- in terms of your potential offtakers over the next 3, 4, 5 years, do you think their comments during present day affects your positioning in terms of being a potential partner of choice on many of these projects? Or how should we interpret that industry rhetoric versus your own? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Chris, the products that we are going to make, the potential users for green hydrogen are steelmaking, refineries, shipping, using green ammonia as fuel for ships to meet the very stringent requirements in Europe and hydrogen for mobility. Those are the 4 areas that will eventually -- the offtakers for the product. And we are obviously talking to people in all of those 4 sectors. We don't have anything to announce. And if we are talking to anybody, we are under NDA, therefore, we cannot announce anything or give any details. But those are the sectors that we will be using green hydrogen.
 On the blue hydrogen side, the developments, the way I see, it is still using blue hydrogen as a fuel to -- using blue hydrogen as a replacement of coal to decarbonize power plants. Blue hydrogen can also be used -- as I mentioned before, I think a significant use will be as fuel for ships. And blue hydrogen will be used in our pipeline for decarbonizing refineries and chemical operations along the Gulf Coast. Those are the sectors that we are talking to. 
Operator: We'll go next to Josh Spector with UBS. 
Joshua Spector: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Just to follow up on the turnaround and maintenance side of it, are you able to size the EPS impact that you think -- in 3Q since you called that out as a bridging item for second half? And would you characterize this year as a heavier maintenance year versus normal? I mean, obviously, there's turnarounds going on all the time but we're maybe not talking about them typically as much as we are today. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Serhan, do you want to take that? 
Samir Serhan: Yes. Sure, Seifi. I mean, definitely, our hydrogen -- our portfolio of hydrogen plant is really getting more and more which basically again, you need to maintain these units like every for 4 years -- around 4 years, you have to do a major turnaround. This year, without really mentioning a specific number, it is at a record high especially in the U.S. with our U.S. Gulf Coast, our assets in California, our assets in Canada. Basically, we have a significant amount of expense when it comes to maintaining our facilities. So -- and also coincided this year, we also -- we have our 4-year turnaround for our major facilities in Rotterdam in Europe. So... 
Joshua Spector: Okay. All right. And if I could just ask then on Asia with helium specifically, you commented earlier that it stabilized. But I think from the last call you were talking about lowering pricing and regaining margins -- or regaining volume, sorry. Has that played out? Has it stabilized lower? Or have you regained any volumes? Where is that? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: We have lowered prices in order to stabilize the situation. 
Operator: We'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. 
Laurence Alexander: Just two very quick ones. Just on the pricing -- merchant pricing in North America, is there any quirkiness in the end market mix where you're seeing pricing? Or is this 6% across the board? And then secondly, how much capital do you have invested in gray hydrogen currently? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: I would like to have Dr. Serhan answer the first question. And the second question, I'm not sure we want to disclose that in detail. 
Samir Serhan: I mean, when it comes to the merchant, it's really across the board. It's -- I mean, it's nitrogen, oxygen, argon, helium. It's really across the board that we really have pricing discipline there in this inflationary environment. So -- and I just also want to highlight in the Americas, I mean, we've mentioned it before in the prepared comments that again on-site -- hydrogen on-site has been really doing very well. I mean -- and that's helping the volume for the year. And we continue to see this going for some extended amount of time because of the refining activities. 
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. 
Michael Sison: Nice quarter. In terms of the fourth quarter, what volume growth do you need to hit the range that you have? I know you gave us a lot of -- 3 or 4 different reasons why it's going to be a lot stronger than the prior quarters. But any thoughts on what type of volume growth you need? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: We have really not -- volume growth, not on the base business. But we will have volume growth based on new plants coming onstream. But most of it -- yes, sir. 
Michael Sison: Got it. And then just a -- yes, sorry. But yes, just a quick follow-up on your NEOM and Louisiana. I know you can't really or want to tell us what price, but what is the return premium that you're looking for to sign the offtake? Is there a certain way for us to look at it at -- from that standpoint? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: As high as we can get. Because if we have a product that nobody else has, then why should we be satisfied with a specific return? And I, obviously, do not want to disclose that, but -- any kind of a return. We are -- we have a product that is going to come onstream that people are going to need. Nobody makes that product today. So what is the price for that? The price for that is not calculated on the basis that this is my capital, this is the return, and therefore, we do that. When you have somebody that people need, you extract the maximum price.
 We all go to the gas station and pay what we are paying for the gas station. The cost of taking oil out of the ground in the Middle East is $5 a barrel. If you sit down and calculate it based on the return, we should be paying $0.25 a gallon for gas. But people are sitting there saying, "I have it. You need it. It's $80 today. It might be $200 another day or it might be another price another day." So we are not basing the pricing from our products based on return. We are basing it on what we can get out of the market because there is significant value that we bring to the market for the investor.
 Right now, if you have deep blue hydrogen that you can give to somebody where they can make renewable diesel to sell it in California, there is a significant premium for that. So that's how we look at it. 
Samir Serhan: And if you allow me, Seifi, I just wanted to highlight, today, we already have 3 major on-site blue hydrogen contracts for 15-plus years with a premium for the blue product. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Right. Obviously, we haven't disclosed some of that yet. But we know what is going on in the marketplace, and our goal is to get the maximum return for our investors, not to sit down. And if it was just a matter of saying, "This is my investment and this is a 10% return and this is the [ price ]." Then you don't need to pay somebody $15 million to be CEO of Air Products. Then anybody can do that. 
Operator: We'll go next to John Roberts with Mizuho. 
John Ezekiel Roberts: Seifi, did you say 15 years from now, Air Products will not have any SMRs running? Did you mean not running without carbon capture? Or -- can you talk about the average useful life left on the SMRs? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Yes. I very much appreciate you bringing up the point. I should have mentioned that we will not have any SMRs running without carbon capture. That is correct. I'm glad you clarified that. 
John Ezekiel Roberts: On the lower natural gas feedstock cost for hydrogen, besides the pass-through impact on margin, I think you also get to key the benefit of efficiency improvements. And those efficiency improvements, I guess, are worth a lot less when gas is low. Is that a meaningful headwind? Or is that immaterial right now? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, I wouldn't want to say it's meaningful, but it is a hit, and I really appreciate you picking up on that. That is exactly right. When natural gas price is at $12 a 1,000 cubic feet, those bonuses are significant. Now the natural gas is $3, $2.5, the bonus has become a lot smaller. 
Operator: At this time, there are no additional questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much. I would like to again thank everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Please stay safe and healthy, and all the best. And thank you for your very good questions today, everybody. We really appreciate that. 
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-02-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products' First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar. Please go ahead sir.
Sidd Manjeshwar: Hi, thank you, Jenifer. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2024 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on slide number two. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. As always, I would like to begin with the slide number three, our safety performance, which is our number one priority at Air Products. I'm very pleased to share that our employee recordable injury rate in first quarter was 78% than in 2014, and our employee lost time injury rate was at a record row, the best in the industry. Our ultimate goal will always be zero accidents and zero incidents. Now, please turn to slide number four, which summarizes our management philosophy. These principles remain fundamental to how we manage and grow our company. Now please turn to slide number five. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the results for this quarter. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.82 was 7% higher than last year. Our business performed well and we are moving forward. There were several positive contributions to this result that included strong conversion margins, robust on-site activities in Americas and Europe, and higher quality affiliate income globally. Despite the year-to-year improvement that I just mentioned, our results diverged from the guidance range that we have given you due to several items that they're not factored in our first quarter 2024 outlook. We have given you a forecast and we are delivering less than the forecast, but again I’d like to express that we are 7% higher than last year. These factors that affected our guidance are: number one, larger than anticipated volume headwinds from weak economic growth in China. We were too optimistic about performance in China. Second one is lower helium demand in electronics especially across the world. But I would like to mention that our pricing in helium is very stable and very robust, but we have the volume was lower than we expected. There is a high -- we had experience higher cost for a sale of equipment project and the impact of Argentinian currency devaluation. With this, let me talk about our revised full-year guidance range. Please turn to slide number six. We now expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.50, which reflects the first quarter events I just discussed. It also reflects evolving geopolitical developments and uncertainties and continued weakness in Asia and Helium volumes. This new range is supported by expected positive volume contributions from several new onsite plans and improvement in our LNG sale of equipment business, as well as continuing cost productivity that we always pursue. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.60 and $2.75. We continue to expect our CapEx to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2024. Now please turn to slide number seven. We are proud of our adjusted earnings per share improvement since 2014 and we have delivered on a consecutive basis for the last 10-years more than 10% annual growth in our earnings. I would like to take the time to thank each and every one of our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication and commitment, which has made it possible for us to deliver these excellent results. Now please turn to slide number eight. In addition to investing in high return projects, we believe creating shareholder value includes returning cash to our investors by paying a healthy dividend directly to them. In January, we again raised our quarterly dividend to $1.77 per share per quarter, extending our record of 42 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to our shareholders in 2024, while continuing to execute hard return industrial gas and clean hydrogen projects that support our customers in their sustainability journey, and drive the energy transition. This balanced approach to capital allocation, which allows us to meet our capital needs, while maintaining our A2 credit rating. Now please turn to slide number nine, which shows our EBITDA margin trends since 2014. Our margins have returned to roughly 40% since the second-half of fiscal year 2023, going to 1,500 basis point improvement versus 2014. And our margins are leading industry margins and they reflect the continued strength of our business model. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer our Chief Financial Officer to give you a summary of our first quarter 2024 results. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to slide 10 for a review of our first quarter results. As Seifi stated, our business fundamentals are strong. In comparison to last year, we continue to show underlying sales growth with both positive volume and price. Overall, price for the quarter was up despite lower energy costs across most regions. Volume improved 3% driven by strong on-site volume, including higher demand for hydrogen and contributions from new assets, but partially offset by weaker demand for helium, particularly in Asia. Declining natural gas prices in Europe and North America resulted in 11% lower energy cost pass-through for the company overall. This had no impact on profit, but contributed to higher margins. EBITDA improved 8% as favorable volume, price net of power cost, and equity affiliate income, more than offset higher costs driven by higher plan maintenance, activities and inflation. EBITDA margin of 39.2% jumps more than 500 basis points with lower energy cost pass-through contributing to about three-fourths of this improvement. ROCE remains steady at about 12%. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been about 13%. Sequentially, results were unfavorable primarily due to seasonality in the Americas and sale of equipment headwinds in our corporate segments. Now please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our first quarter adjusted earnings was $2.82 per share up $0.18 or 7%, compared to last year due to favorable volume, pricing, and higher equity affiliate income partially offset by unfavorable costs. Volume was $0.11 due to improvements in America and Europe, which more than offset shortfalls in Asia and the corporate segment. Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.15 this quarter, driven by both pricing actions and lower power costs. Costs had an unfavorable impact of $0.21, driven by higher planned and maintenance costs, inflation, and our efforts support our growth strategy. Equity affiliate income was $0.18 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of the Jazan project and positive results from our unconsolidated joint ventures across most regions. The remaining items including lower tax rates, higher interest expense and other non-operating expense together had a modest negative $0.05 impact. Before I turn the call to Dr. Serhan, I would also like to thank the people of Air Products for their commitment to the company. I am proud to be working alongside them as we continue to execute our strategy. Now to begin to review our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan.
Samir Serhan: Thank you, Melissa. Please turn to slide 12 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year price and volume together were up 5%. Hardware, merchants and price increase of 6%. This represents a 2% price improvement for the region overall. This shows contribution margin improvement. Volume grew 3% due to strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA was up 9% driven by strong price as well as favorable volume and equity affiliate income, while partially offset by higher planned and maintenance costs. EBITDA margin was up by almost 800 basis points driven mostly by lower energy cost pass-through. Eventually, EBITDA decreased 7% mainly due to seasonality as demand moderated and maintenance activities picked up during the winter. Now please turn to slide 13 for a review of our Asia segment results. The challenging economic conditions in China and the weak electronics market continued to put pressure on the region. Prior to last year, our volumes were flat for the region as higher on-site activity offset lower helium demand. Price jumped 1% as we continued to focus on price over volume. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were down primarily due to the unfavorable helium volumes and higher costs. Sequentially, results improved relative to the unfavorable business mix in the previous quarter. Please turn to slide 14 for a review of our Europe segment results. Volumes were up 9% benefitting from better on-site activities including the new project in Uzbekistan. Compared to last year merchant pricing remained stable relative to the decline in energy costs, contributing to margin improvement. EBITDA was up 28%, driven by favorable volume, lower power costs and stronger currencies against the US dollar, which more than compensated for increased cost due to inflation and planned, maintenance activities. EBITDA margin was over 1,000 basis points higher about half of which was due to the impact of lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially results improved driven by favorable price, volume and costs. Now, please turn to slide 15 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results, compared to last year sales decreased due to lower volume, EBITDA improved due to the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in mid-January of last year. Please now turn to slide 16 for our corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses, as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Despite higher sales from LNG activity, EBITDA declined due to higher costs in our non-LNG sale of equipment business as Seifi mentioned before. Our activities related to the LNG equipment and technology business are robust. We continue to have constructive conversations with customers, who are interested in our offerings. And we expect our LNG related projects to improve the corporate segment moving forward. At this moment, I also would like to thank our teams around the world for their effort and demonstrating their determination to overcome the challenges we are facing. Now I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to a slide number 17. As I always say a real competitive advantage is the commitment, dedication, and motivation of our people. I am proud to see that commitment and motivation in action every day in our company, and I'm very proud of our people. The fundamentals of our existing business are strong and we are moving forward. The short-term issues we have discussed do not change the compelling long-term prospects of Air Products. Air Products is pursuing a first mover growth strategy with our core industrial gases business as the first pillar and our blue and green hydrogen projects as the second pillar. Executing our strategy in these two pillars with sustainability underpinning, both of them, enables us to fulfill our higher purpose as a company, which is to help solve significant energy and environmental challenges in our world, that is our highest purpose. First, our industrial gases business and technology solutions help customers across dozens of industries improve yield, increase production, reduce energy consumption, and lower emissions. In other words, to make more with less, while reducing the impact on the environment. Second, the world needs more energy and wants that energy delivered with a lower carbon footprint. At Air Products, we are demonstrating our leadership position, leveraging our decade-long experience, core competencies, core technologies, and our ability to execute world-scale hydrogen projects. By producing and delivering low and zero carbon hydrogen at the scale for heavy duty transportation and industry, we can meaningfully contribute to the goal of decarbonizing the world. We believe that the first mover advantage will be substantial and deliver enduring long-term shareholder value, both in terms of return to Air Products and in generating a cleaner future for everybody. With that, we are now more than happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. When did the Gulf Coast ammonia project come on and is that a meaningful income stream for you?
Seifi Ghasemi: Gulf Coast ammonia is consists of two different parts. One if the hydrogen plant and other one is the actual ammonia plant. I can comment on the hydrogen plant, because we own that and that is a sale of gas. That is on the stream and it's producing revenue. And on the other part, I don't want to comment, because we don't own that facility and I like the owners to make a statement on that if it's necessary.
Jeff Zekauskas: In the quarter there was -- yes thank you for that. In the quarter the expense was materially higher year-over-year that your expectations for 2024, you have a large cost-cutting program. Heavy losses on sale of equipment would be smaller. There was significant room for improvement, particular line. Is that the case or things changed?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, you are absolutely right that is the case. In the first quarter, our costs were higher, because of the sale of equipment issue that you mentioned. And we expect that in the -- as we go forward, that would not be repeated and therefore our year-to-year costs will be lower as I had mentioned to you before.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning.
Samir Serhan: Good morning.
Mike Harrison: I was hoping that you could give a little bit more detail on what is going on within the helium business? Is that a situation where demand is lower or a situation where you guys are struggling to get the volumes of helium that you need? And also, which regions have the biggest exposure to helium? It seems like this is mostly an Asia issue at least in the first quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you for the question and that's an excellent question. Number one, we do not have any issues with having helium molecules for sale. We are actually the best -- we have always been the supplier that has delivered helium to people when they need it, we have pattern, we have significant production facilities around the world, so we are a very reliable supplier and we have always been. The issue with helium is that number one demand is lower especially in electronics across the board and particularly in China and in Asia. And the other thing is that as I said we operate on the basis that we want value for the product that we are selling. So we have held on the pricing and whether we might have lost some market share, that is possible. But we have no issues delivering the product, but we definitely see, as I said, a weakness in demand across the world. And in terms of Air Products, in terms of helium volumes, obviously Asia is a significant part of that. It's not the other regions use a lot of helium too, but Asia is the biggest.
Mike Harrison: All right that's very helpful and then my second question is related to your guidance. It looks like the implied guidance for the first-half of the year is around $5.50 in EPS and you're expecting maybe something closer to $7 in the second-half? Can you talk about the visibility that you have that gives you confidence on a much better second-half and maybe help us bridge the improvement that you're expecting in the second-half versus the first-half that, that $50 or so.
Seifi Ghasemi: That's an excellent question. Obviously the guidance is what is our best estimate at this point, right? We can foresee the world events. But fundamentally, when you look Air Products during the years, we consistently deliver about 46%, 47% percent of the year results in the first-half, and we deliver around 53%, 54% in the second-half, so the second-half is usually our strongest quarter because of seasonality. So you should take that into account and then the other thing that we are right now by giving you the guidance is that we are expecting that in the second-half of the year some of the onsite projects that we have will be running very strong and therefore we will have a higher income from those. That is our estimate as of today. But how the world will turn, we'll see. But that is how we bridge the gap of why we will be able to deliver the $7 versus the $5.50 in the first-half.
Mike Harrison: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to John Roberts from Mizuho.
John Roberts: Thank you. Seifi, is the weakness in China also related to on-site operations? And maybe you could separate the gasifier business from other on-site?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, first of all, thank you for your question and I hope all is well with you. There is no weakness in on-site in China. You know, our on-site business is take or pay across the world, therefore we don't see any issues there. The fundamental issue is on the merchant side and helium, and that is related to the economic activity. I just like to caution everybody on the call that the economic situation in China is not as robust as people might think. We, as you know, we make products that are used instantaneously. We are a great leading indicator. And things are not really that exciting, that part of the world.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Steve Byrne from Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. I was just looking at the location of Jazan and it seems to be within 100 miles of quite a few of these recent strikes in Yemen and just wanted to ask, is everything there okay at the plant or do you see any access to labor or risks of this issue going on right now?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well first of all, up to now we have not seen any incidents none of these missiles and so on have been directed at the facility. So I mean, I can't predict the future, but up to now there has not been any issues. The refinery is running fully our business -- our investment I mean our performance there is great I'm very proud of our people. We are operating 16 gasifiers, which are the largest in the world for gas declined the bottom of the refinery and despite predictions for the worst those things are actually working and they are producing syngas, they are supplying hydrogen to the refinery and we are making close to 4,000 megawatts of power that is delivered to the Saudi grid. So up to now everything is fine. Thank you.
Steve Byrne: Very good. Thank you. And can you provide any more detail on the CapEx target for the year, the $5 billion to $5.5 billion. Can you just highlight what are the largest project within that list. I was just curious whether you are moving forward with the project in North Texas this year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Right now in that $5 billion and $5.5 billion that is not a significant amount of money for the project on Texas, because we are in the process of getting the permit and doing the preliminary engineering. But we did spend a few $100 million, but it is not significant part of that $5.5 billion. The $5 billion to $5.5 billion is mainly going to be spent on our continuing operations in NEOM in Saudi Arabia for our green hydrogen facility, a substantial amount of it will go to our blue hydrogen facility and other substantial amounts will be our blue hydrogen facility in Canada and then obviously our expenditure on the sustainable airline fuel facility in Los Angeles. And then obviously we have our maintenance CapEx and about $1 billion a year that we spend on our day-to-day investments like any other industrial gas business that they don't usually talk about it and we don't put out press releases about how many small projects won, because we do win small projects like everybody else, but that is about $1 billion too and our maintenance CapEx is around 500, 600 and so $1.5 billion is those and then the rest of it is for the big project.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, we'll go next to John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, [Indiscernible]. So we had a question on the dividend hike that you guys announced earlier. It strikes us as kind of smaller than I guess what we've seen in the past from Air Products. And I guess the question is, why is that? And is there any concern from, say, the rating agencies around the comfort with your capital spending or is there some change why that hike would be as kind of modest as it's been? I guess how should we think about that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well for the past six or seven years I have always been telling people that I personally believe that dividend should be a percentage of the stock price and we had given people a guidance that we target that we pay about 2.5% of our stock price as dividends and we were doing that. But now with the stock price where it is, and you are talking about now more than $7. It is significantly higher than that. So I don't see why we should significantly increase the dividend than the stock prices where it is, because the shareholders are getting more than 2.5% from the stock and then 10% growth and it becomes at least almost again 12.5% return if they buy the stock. If there is no issue with respect to our cash or our cash flow and so on, but we also have investors who believe we shouldn't pay any dividend, but obviously that will never happen and they are never going to reduce the dividend. But the rate of increase is very directly related to the stock price, my friend.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. So it's more about the yield, not necessarily the earnings growth or anything like that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
John McNulty: Okay, and then just as a follow-up question, it would just be on the, I know you mentioned earlier in kind of first-half versus second-half, there's a bunch of projects that should be running a little harder, running up more or coming on. I guess can you remind us what projects, you know, aren't necessarily fully running in your first-half of the year, but will be in the second-half of the year just so we can kind of model that out or map that out a little bit better?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well that's one then I'm going to get into disclosing the operational details of our customers and I'm not -- I don't have the privilege of doing that because of the confidentiality agreements we have. So if you give me a break, I cannot answer that question in detail. Sorry about that.
John McNulty: No, no problem. No problem at all. We'll definitely give you a break on that. Thanks for the time.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask on the helium, what was sort of the surprise in the quarter on the electronic side of the equation, like so what's really changing with those customers? Is it something in particular, or is it just the economy there is decelerating? And are we at the point with it in the electronics piece that you're comfortable that, you know, that aspect has flattened out at a level that you're comfortable with. Maybe we could start there.
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, good morning, Vincent. Thanks for the good question. You know, usually what happens with the electronic industry and you know this better than I do, is that they run very strongly during the third quarter of the calendar year to make all of the chips and so on which are used for all the toys and everything that people are going to buy for Christmas. And then when that period is over, usually the fourth quarter of the year for the chipmakers is slower. That is the general thing. And then in addition to that, you do have economic conditions and all of that. I am not an expert in terms of the dynamics of the electronic industry, but I would like to tell you that, that is what we are seeing, that a lot of these people are slowing down. And then the other thing that might be in play is that the helium price is being high, it significantly affects the operational people at the chip manufacturing facilities to try to conserve as much helium as they can or other users. So there might be a little bit of a demand destruction too.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And then as a follow-up, in the fiscal second quarter, you know, we obviously just had another winter storm or winter freeze in the Gulf Coast area. Are you anticipating that, you know, you're going to have some downtime associated with that or customers are going to have downtime from some plants being turned off in preparation for that weather event?
Seifi Ghasemi: That's a very difficult question to answer, to be honest. That might be the case, but I don't want to predict that, Vincent. I don't know.
Vincent Andrews: I just meant what had already happened, the storm that happened in January. Is that already baked in?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Dr. Serhan, do you have anything to add to that?
Samir Serhan: Minor issues really that happened. We still see very strong hydrogen demand even during that phase.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, Vincent. Thank you.
Vincent Andrews: Yes, thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Excellent.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hey, David.
David Begleiter: Good morning. Just staying on helium, can you quantify the impact of the year-over-year helium profit decline in Q1? And your expectations for the full-year in terms of helium profit decline?
Seifi Ghasemi: David, you are asking a question that we have never answered, that is we have never really disclosed the details of the performance of our helium business for competitive reasons. And I'm sure you understand that. So I do not want to quantify that exactly. But if you look at the, you know, when you compare to last year -- when we compare to last year, we are still ahead. But we are trying to explain is the difference between what we delivered versus guidance versus last year we are still ahead. But we expected, we did not expect the weakness in helium the way it has materialized. Would it continue in the second quarter and the third quarter -- I mean in the second, third and fourth quarter of our fiscal year remains to be seen and that is one of the reasons we lowered our guidance, because we are allowing for the fact that it might continue. But we don't know for sure.
David Begleiter: Understood. Thank you. And just on the Alberta project, now that we're within 12 months, hopefully a startup, do you have timing of that project ramping up earlier next year? And how should we think about the earnings contribution throughout the calendar year ‘25 for Alberta?
Seifi Ghasemi: David, you broke up, I didn't understand which project you were referring to?
David Begleiter: The Alberta project. When will it come on stream and how are you thinking about the earnings cadence post its start-up early next year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Excellent. I'll have Dr. Serhan answer that. Samir?
Samir Serhan: Thank you for the question. We remain incredibly excited about our first blue net zero hydrogen project that's in the construction phase right now. We look to bring it on stream in fiscal year ‘25 in line with our customer plans. There are no updates in regard to the deployed capital and also the government incentive we provided that already. So again, we're really fully committed to this asset and things are going well, and we're aligned with our customer IOL.
David Begleiter: We'll be online in the first-half of this fiscal year? Sorry.
Samir Serhan: It's in fiscal year ‘25, I mean, in the second-half.
David Begleiter: Second-half, Thank you.
Samir Serhan: This is really an alignment with the plan, the renewable refinery.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: So basically everything is going well for that up to now.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Josh Spector from UBS.
Josh Spector: Hi, good morning. So I wanted to follow-up just on the guidance and maybe ask specifically, you know, when you talk about the challenges and uncertainty, China and helium demand, et cetera. I guess to hit your second-half, do markets need to improve or are you assuming any improvement there? Or is status quo plus what you see coming online enough to get to what your expectations are today for the second-half?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, we don't expect any improvement. We expect things to be the way they are. I just hope that things don't get worse because of the geopolitical developments. But we are not factoring in any significant improvement in the world economy. No, that's correct.
Josh Spector: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And just on the sale of equipment, so when you talk about the increase in cost there, is that cost to execute? Is that material issue a specific contract? Just thinking about how unique or one off that is. And when you talk about your LNG wins and you've been talking about more projects coming online or sales in the next couple of years, is that a risk we need to think about with some of those contracts underwater or some other cost issue?
Seifi Ghasemi: If I may answer the second part, the LNG thing we expect the projects that you're talking about are the projects which are already under execution and we have won. So the risk on that is low. With respect to the sale of equipment thing, what we are talking about is inflation and delays in execution and all of that that is costing us money. Okay?
Josh Spector: Okay, yes. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Marc Bianchi from TD Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: Hi, thank you. The question was asked earlier about the large components of CapEx and you mentioned NEOM, the two blue hydrogen projects and SAF. You provided an update on Alberta just now. I'm curious if you could update us on the status of the other three?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, on the other three, we don't have anything substantial to report other than what we have told you before. So, things are going okay with them as of right now. So we do not have anything material that has happened to report to you.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thank you, Seifi. Could you just remind us the start-up expectation for NEOM Louisiana and SAF?
Seifi Ghasemi: NEOM, we are expecting December 31, 2026. With Louisiana, what we have said up to now has been fiscal year 2028 and with SAF it is somewhere around fiscal year 2027, depending on us getting all of the permits that we need. So, I'm sorry, with [Indiscernible], I'd like to correct that to 2027, I think I said ‘28, but in 2027. That's approximately the timeline for those projects.
Marc Bianchi: Okay, thank you for that. The other question I had was there have been some reports in news stories lately about natural hydrogen, so naturally occurring hydrogen deposits that could be quite meaningful. I'm curious what your view of that is and if you have any involvement?
Seifi Ghasemi: We do not have any involvement in that and I don't want to give you a scientific answer, but that's a little bit of a pie in the sky that there's hydrogen sitting there that you need to do to reveal and it will come out at zero cost. But we are not involved in any projects like that. And we are not going to get involved in that because we just do not think that that is reality.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Leithead from Barclays.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: Good morning. Could you maybe update us on the state of your ongoing discussions for green and blue ammonia potential off-take? Should we expect some off-take announcements later this year? Or do you still believe it's better to wait until closer to project start-up to formalize some of those?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, on that one, you are raising an excellent point. We have basically told people that do not expect any announcement about any off-take until about a year or year and a half before the plans come on stream. And the main reason for that is that we believe that as we get closer to the deadlines that companies have to comply with the new environmental rules. They would certainly realize that there are not that many real commercial facilities coming on the stream that has the product. Therefore the value of our product will be higher than what people think it is today. So we are not in a hurry to sign any agreements. We think the demand is there. So we are going to take our time. But in the meantime, if somebody wants to act sooner and gives us a contract, a long-term contract, at the prices that we expect, we might announce that sooner. But I wouldn't want the investors to expect any announcements soon.
Mike Leithead: That makes sense. That's Great. That makes sense. And then maybe on a similar note, I believe that the Treasury Department recently came out with guidance around the green hydrogen tax credit. I think most people viewed it as fairly strict although I also believe Air Products' plans are pretty well aligned with this guidance. Bigger picture, do you have any concerns about the strict interpretation limiting the U.S. industry's ability to take off or do you actually see it as advantageous for Air Products?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, we absolutely disagree with that point of view that this is limiting. I mean, how is it limiting? We are complying with every single part of what the Treasury Department has put out, the three pillars, and we are committing billions of dollars to build these facilities. Other people can do the same thing. Some people are trying to get money from the government by continuing to pollute the atmosphere. And we don't believe that. We believe very strongly in the three pillars. That means that any electricity used for production of green hydrogen needs to be additional. Otherwise, you're just going to use coal to replace that power that you use. So it has to be additional. The second thing, it has to be hourly. Because otherwise in the middle of the night when there is no sun, if somebody makes green hydrogen, then you're drawing power from the grid and that has to be replaced again from coal-fired plants and all of that. And so additionality, hourly and then the other thing is that it has to be on the same network. We are fully supportive of what the Treasury department has put out, I'd like to applaud them for sticking to their principles that the IRA was designed not to make companies rich, but IRA was designed to save the environment. And this should not allow people to get some subsidies if they are not doing something to reduce their pollution into the atmosphere. The IRA is not a handout. The IRA is designed, that is why Congress approved it, to improve the environment, And we should all abide by that. Therefore, we are fully in line with the those rules that Treasury put out, and I really hope that they keep their nerve and execute those principles because those are the right principles, And we are fully supportive of that. And again, I'd like to stress that we are spending billions of dollars. We are -- and executing projects right now even before those rules come out, complying with those rules because we think they are the right rules, okay?
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Duffy. How are you?
Duffy Fischer: Good. Thank you. Question on cash flow, if I could. At least in the first quarter, cash flow was down or operating cash flow was down double digits even though earnings was up. Will that invert throughout the year? Would you expect operating cash flow to grow roughly at the same level of EPS this year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Duffy, I'm glad you asked this question, but I'll have Melissa go through the details. But my friend, our EBITDA is going up. If our EBITDA is going up, the cash coming to the company is going up. What we are reporting is accounting and it's the timing of the cash. We report the number because we book it, but when we get the actual cash it's different because of our equity affiliates. But I think the best person to qualify to answer this, because I don't want to get into accounting details, Melissa, would you please explain that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Seifi. And hi, Duffy, how are you? So first of all, Duffy, so our EBITDA cash eversion is stable and our distributable and investment cash flow are both positive. So that's in line with our year-over-year EBITDA improvement. Additionally, we have industry-leading DSO, so all very strong. We did see an incremental reduction in our operating cash flow to EBITDA this quarter. There are a few items that attribute to this, namely it's really timing component related to our distributions of earnings for our large equity affiliate. Again, not an issue with profit, just timing. And the second one is we do manage and look to derisk our helium supply chain and then so we are building some of our helium inventory, which obviously has an offset to operating cash, but obviously, we'll attribute to process moving forward.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, Duffy?
Duffy Fischer: Thank you. You bet. Thank you on that one. And then just on the announcement that the EPA was given to the state of Louisiana the authority to deal with the CO2 sequestration there. Roughly, can you kind of explain how your relationship is with the state and how quickly you think that will speed up the process there and when we might get permits for Louisiana?
Seifi Ghasemi: Duffy, I'm glad you asked that question. We are very excited about that. I think it was the right decision and that will cut about -- we think about a year on the time line of us getting the permit for the Class 6 well. And we do have an excellent relationship with the State of Louisiana, but it's not the relationship. We are going to do the right thing by having the State Louisiana review that. We gain time because the State of Louisiana will have less Class 6 wells to deal with than EPA. So it's just a matter of the workload and they did the right thing by distributing the workload. Therefore, now the State of Louisiana will have fewer applications, and therefore, they can approve our project by about a year faster than the federal government would have done that. So that is why it is very helpful and very impactful and gives us a lot more confidence in terms of our ability to get the Class 6 permit if we need it.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Thank you and good morning. Seifi, I wanted to come back to the helium market dynamics. I heard your comments on the demand side. My question is, have you witnessed any material changes on the supply side of the global market such as the operating status of Gazprom's Amur project in Russia? Or is it strictly a function of demand in terms of the volume shortfall that you cited in the quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that is a very good question. Theoretically, whatever Amur produces in Russia, theoretically there is global sanctions on that. That, that is not supposed to be getting into the market. Is it getting into the market illegally and therefore increasing the supply of helium, and therefore that is why people are buying from other people? It could be the case. I am not sure. But the detailed dynamics on that are. And I don't want to be interpreting sanctions laws and all of that. But what you are suggesting is a possibility. We are looking into that. We haven't seen any significant factor from that yet, and at least we don't see it yet, but it might be the case.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I had a few sort of housekeeping questions possibly for Melissa. I think you mentioned devaluation of the Argentine peso and we talked about the cost overrun from the sale of equipment project. Can you quantify the impact of some of those issues in the quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: I don't think we want to quantify the details of every one of them, but the Argentine currency is easy. I'll answer that, make it a lot easy for Melissa, is that effect was about $10 million on our bottom line, for the Argentine currency about $0.03.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. And the SOE, no comment on that one?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, the rest of it, we don't want to break down how much was helium, how much was the sale of equipment and how much was the slowdown in China because then we will be giving you very too much competitive information, if you don't mind.
Kevin McCarthy: I see, okay. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Patrick Cunningham from Citi.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. Could you maybe comment on the direction of price in Europe, how sustainable these margins are going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, quite frankly, we did -- that is one of the areas where we did better than we expected. Our results in Europe are excellent, the margins are up 1,000 basis points, and that is because people have done a good job hanging on to the price while energy prices are going down. How this will develop in the future obviously depends on what happens to energy prices and so on. But I'm very proud of our people in terms of their performance and in terms of making sure that they maintain the pricing and we have been successful. And as Dr. Serhan was saying, our European business did very well during the quarter.
Patrick Cunningham: Great. And then maybe just a related follow-up on the Uzbekistan project. How much volume was up on Uzbekistan? And what sort of contribution should we have throughout the year? I know previously you talked about $0.35 per share. How is Uzbekistan performing relative to your expectations?
Seifi Ghasemi: Dr. Serhan, would you like to answer that?
Samir Serhan: Yes. I just want to start by saying this project really has been a great fit for both Air Products and Uzbekistan. It leverages our core competencies and address the country's desire for energy independence and socioeconomic development. This project includes the world's largest ATRs, auto thermal reformer. And just to remind everybody, to produce blue hydrogen, you need to use auto-thermal reformers and those are the largest in the world, or you need to use box units, which are the partial oxidation, which is the technology we bought from GE gasification. We are excited about the operational and technological synergies by operating these large ATRs. The asset was brought onstream in October '23. We expect that to contribute around $0.35 for the full-year.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay.
Patrick Cunningham: Great. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Operator this would be the last question, okay.
Operator: Thank you. Okay, we'll go to Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sorry. I made a mistake about the timing, we can answer some more questions, if necessary. If people have questions, go ahead.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess my first question on fiscal '24 EPS growth, the projects that's recently come onstream before that you've noted in the slide, Are those contributing what you thought they would contribute in 2024? And I guess sort of the follow-up is that the delta between the 13% growth to the 6% to 9% growth now has nothing to do with the projects, more of the other stuff that you talked about in terms of headwinds?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that -- I don't like to give you a general answer in the sense that if you're up year-on-year and in the meantime China is going down, helium volumes are lower and we have had these headwinds, then the only reason that it's going up is because some of the other projects are contributing, of course. So that's the way I would like to leave it with you, okay? Negative is still going up. Therefore, the other products are contributing, yes.
Mike Sison: Yes, that's great. And then beyond 2024, when you think about '25, '26, '27, more of a longer-term sort of view, how do you think the growth algorithm changes or maybe doesn't change as we look out of those years in terms of EPS growth?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think Air Products will deliver on the average an EPS growth of the 10% that we have delivered before. That's our goal. And one year, we might be 9%, one year we're going to be 11%. But overall, we are going to continue on that trend. And we promised that 10-years ago, we have delivered, and I fully expect that we will continue to deliver that.
Mike Sison: Right. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go to Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Dan Rizzo: Hi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for getting me in. I just want to make sure that of the projects under execution that's listed on page 19, the next one that's going to come online is the one in Alberta, Canada, correct?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Alberta, Canada is the next one, which is going to come onstream. And as Dr. Serhan said, we expect that to be in fiscal year 2025.
Dan Rizzo: Are there, and this will be my second question, should the other projects come on right behind that? Or will there be, I don't know, year like delays? Or I'm just trying to think of the cadence as these are coming online.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, after that, we will have in '26 -- by the end of fiscal year '26, we will have -- by the end of calendar '26, we will have our green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia, The year after that, we will have our blue hydrogen project in Louisiana. And the year after that, we will have hopefully other projects that we will announce.
Dan Rizzo: Okay, thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Laurent Favre from BNP.
Laurent Favre: Yes, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I'd like to go back to the SAF project, actually. I think you just mentioned that the start-up would be in 2027. In May last year, you had in, I guess, for startup in '25. And in August, it was still part of the group of projects that should be up and running by 2026. So I was wondering if you could talk about, I guess, what are the specific reasons for this more than one year delay. Is it the customer side? Or is it execution on your side? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it is related to the fact that we are building this plant in California. And you know in California, it usually takes a long time to get permits. So it is dependent on the timing of the permits for construction for that facility. Once we have a final, final ruling on the permit, then we will be able to give you a definite date about when that plant is going to come onstream.
Laurent Favre: And could you size for us the potential cost of a run on top of the $2.5 billion that was initially slated? Are we talking about a material difference?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'm not sure I understood the question.
Sidd Manjeshwar: No. I think Laurence, on that one, the capital, we earn the return on the capital of the project. We won't anticipate any capital update there.
Seifi Ghasemi: The return on the project is fixed. We are going to get a return on the capital that we spent, no matter what the capital is. Okay?
Laurent Favre: Okay, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Laurent Favre: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from Sebastian Bray from Berenberg.
Sebastian Bray: Hello, good morning, everybody and thank you for taking my questions. My first one is on merchant pricing as it stands today. Is this stable in Europe or the U.S.? Has it started to decline? Or has it started to go up? So it seems to be stable, but I wanted to double check? My second one is on guidance. Are we just assuming when setting the EPS growth rate guided for '24 the dollar rates as they stand today hold for the rest of the year? My third one is a more philosophical question on pricing. Is the desire to wait longer for the clean ammonia and clean hydrogen project offtake agreements a reaction to try and hedge out for risk that IRA subsidies maybe changed from '25, i.e., if that industry shakes out and it turns out the projects need clean -- higher clean hydrogen pricing to be economic with fewer subsidies available? Is the APD approach to say, well, we'll wait for the industry to shake out and see what comes? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, you're asking a very, very good question and I would like to tell you that we are the first mover in these projects. We are investing significant amount of money being the first mover. We -- obviously, my job is try to maximize return for the investors. And if we were the first mover and we took the risk, as they say, building these facilities before we had contracts, we should get rewarded by that and not just have projects which have the standard returns but be rewarded with a higher return. That's one thing. And then the second thing is that we genuinely believe that where we are in these projects, we will have a product which will be in significant demand as we get closer to people trying to comply with the rules that are already in place, in Europe especially. By 2028, a lot of the industries have to use the products that we make, and we don't see that many people making the product. So in that case, we are not in a hurry to give it away. Obviously, our job is to maximize profit for the company, get the best that we can, and that is the philosophy that we are following. It is not because of concerns about the other things that you mentioned, no. I think that the subsidies and so on are going to get enacted. Every day that goes by you see the governments taking action. Recently it was Japan, before it has been Europe, it's well established, U.S. with the IRA. So events as you go forward every day points in the direction that hopefully our strategy is the right strategy, and we want to take maximum advantage of that.
Samir Serhan: Actually Seifi, there has been a report from the International Energy Agency that indicated that out of all of the projects announced for green hydrogen by 2030 to come onstream, only 7% will eventually come onstream by 2030.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Sorry, we gave you a long answer, but I hope we addressed your issue.
Sebastian Bray: No, it's appreciated, Seifi. Thank you. And the merchant pricing and the question on FX assumption for the rest of the year on a more tactical or short-term basis.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Well, that's again a very good question. We make our estimate -- Melissa, why don't you answer that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So let me give you an answer the merchant. So merchant-on-merchant pricing was up slightly. So we had stronger merchant-merchant pricing in the Americas and Asia, which was partially offset by some small decrease in Europe. However, I do want to mention that in Europe, our conversion margin stayed strong because the power cost decreased at a faster rate than our -- so the conversion margin maintain strong in all three regions.
Seifi Ghasemi: And with respect to FX, when we give you an estimate, we give you an estimate based on the exchange rates as of today. So that is -- we are not assuming any significant change in the exchange rate.
Sebastian Bray: That’s very helpful. Thank you, Seifi all the best for the time and questions.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Operator, since there are no other questions, I would like to thank everybody for joining our call today. We again appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you in 3 months. All the very best, and thank you for listening.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-11-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products' Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar. Please go ahead sir.
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Annette. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter 2023 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide #2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. I would like to begin with the Slide #3, our safety performance which is our number one priority at Air Products. I'm pleased to share that our safety record has improved compared to last year continuing the significant progress we have made since 2014. Our ultimate goal will always be zero incidents and zero accidents. Now please turn to Slide #4, which summarizes our management philosophy. We reiterate these principles every quarter because they are fundamental to how we manage the company and continue to profitably grow our earnings per share. Now pleased to turn to Slide #5. Air Products has a very strong business model and a long-term strategy to deliver consistent earnings growth for the short and the long-term and I stress the long-term. Projects in our onsite business where we have long-term take or pay contracts with our customers drove our volume growth this year despite economic weakness across the regions. Our onsite business generates stable cash flow and consistently contributes about half of our total sales. Also noteworthy is that strong pricing action in our merchant business as well as our ability to contractually pass through energy costs in our onsite business, helped us mitigate inflation as well as higher power and energy costs, which we experienced last year. We also continue to successfully execute our long-term strategy to be the leader in blue and green hydrogen for the future with a significant number of clean hydrogen mega projects and their execution. Nobody in the world is matching what we are doing. Finally, our backlog of over $19 billion sets up a multiyear framework for double digit earnings per share growth, which has been our goal since 2014 and remains our goal for the future. Now please turn to Slide #6. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $3.15 per share exceeded the top end of our guidance for the quarter and improved $0.30 or 11% versus last year. For the full year fiscal 2023, our adjusted earnings per share of 11.51 one improved $1.26 or 12% over prior year, continuing our strong track record of consistently delivering double digit average earnings growth per share since 2014.
NEOM: Before I go any further, I want to take time to thank all of our employees around the world, every one of the 23,000 of them, for their dedication and hard work, which has made it possible for us to deliver these impressive results despite significant economic and geopolitical headwinds. Now please turn to Slide #7. We are continuing to deliver on one we promised to our shareholders in 2014 executing to deliver an average of at least 10% growth in earnings per share each year as we move forward. We believe our two-pillar strategy of focusing on our base business while extending our leadership in the growing demand for clean hydrogen, that enable us to continue to deliver double digit growth in our EPS as we go forward. Now please turn to Slide #8. We are proud again of our accomplishment of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increases. As you can see on this slide since 2014 we have increased our dividend on an average of 10% every year. Slide #9 shows our EBITDA margin trend continuing to be my favorite slide. Our margins have increased to nearly 40% in the second half of fiscal year 2023 confirming the strength of our business model and the significant cash flow that we generate. Now please turn to Slide #10 for our fiscal year 2024 outlook and guidance. Although there will continue to be challenging economic conditions in the near-term. I remain very optimistic about Air Products future. Our capital deployment strategy and strong business model will sustain our double digit average earnings growth rate. Therefore fiscal year 2024, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $12:80 to $13.10 per share, up 13% at the midpoint over last year. We expect new projects, many of which are already on stream, to drive our earnings per share growth next year. Additionally, we also expect improved LNG sale of equipment activities to add to our favorable results in 2024. And for the first quarter of 2024, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.90 to $3.05, up 10% to 16% over last year. We also see our CapEx for next year somewhere between $5 billion $5.5 billion. Now please turn to Slide #11. I know that some of our investors refer to our major project commitments slide to track our projects. However, the size and scale of these projects, which all have multiyear execution time frames, certainly now warrant more than time and attention than we can give them in a single line on a single slide. Therefore, we remain committed to providing investors visibility and meaningful update to a scheduled capital and off taker status as we continue to progress our major projects. So from time to time, we will give you a more depth look into our projects. Today we have decided to give you an update on our blue hydrogen and blue ammonia clean energy complex in Louisiana, which is one of the largest projects that we are executing. Please turn to Slide #12. We announced our intent to build this broader scale facility in Louisiana in October 2021. As we moved forward with detailed planning to execute this project, a significant positive event happened in August of 2022 when the United States Congress passed the RRA legislation which created tax incentives for the production of blue and green hydrogen. In addition, by 2022 it was becoming more and more evident that the future demand for blue hydrogen and blue ammonia is improving significantly supported by positive developments in other regions of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan. Not only is there growing need to decarbonize the heavy transportation and industrial sector such as a seed, but also other growing applications including using low carbon intensity blue ammonia to fuel ships, reduce emissions from power plants and more. These events, especially the passage of the RRA legislation, LED us to consider that now rather than later is the best time to build the infrastructure for this project to accommodate future expansion. It is important that we pre-invest in the infrastructure needed for future expansion now, so that when the demand increases rapidly, as we expect it to, we will be able to bring the next phase of this project on stream as fast as possible. In addition to the increased cost to build the infrastructure, obviously the project cost has gone up due to inflation that we are seeing in the past three years since we announced the project and anticipate in the future to build this facility. In addition to all of this, we have included in the $7 billion funds to cover the interest on capital that we will be using as we build this plant. This facility is a huge facility. We are very excited about its future. We remain totally committed to this project and its profitability. It is a unique one-of-a-kind project that will put us significantly ahead of anybody else in the world in the production of this product. We see significant demand for the product that this plant will produce. As a result, I am very pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors has given us final investment approval to proceed with the project at the new capital estimate of $7 billion. We expect this project will deliver double digit returns to our investors when it is fully on stream. As you know, this project will produce hydrogen and ammonia at very low carbon intensity. As the first company to make these unique low carbon hydrogen and ammonia products at a large scale, we expect to get a premium for the product which will allow us to achieve double digit returns on capital. Additionally, the scale of our activities will provide a cost advantage over other similar projects in development at this time. We are really excited about the future of low carbon hydrogen and ammonia that is by this project in Louisiana is well underway and we are laying the groundwork to meet the expected additional demand in the future. The additional infrastructure we are building now will continue to be a competitive advantage for Air Products in the future. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you a summary of the fourth quarter 2023 results. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. And my thanks to the people of Air Products who have again delivered double digit average earnings growth in a difficult environment, an impressive trend that we have achieved in nine of the past 10 quarters. Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our fourth quarter results. In comparison to last year, we have again achieved underlying sales growth despite ongoing economic weakness. Merchant price was 4% higher compared to last year with positive pricing in most regions. This corresponds to a 2% price improvement for the whole company. Higher onsite volume, including strong demand for hydrogen and higher LNG sale of equipment activities, were offset by one-time opportunities in the prior year, resulting in flat volumes for the company overall. Declining natural gas costs in Europe and the Americas reduced energy cost pass-through to our onsite customers. This 14% decline in sales has no impact on profit, but was a significant contributor to our higher margin. The overall impact of currency was minimal as a strengthening of the euro and British pound against the U.S. dollar was mostly offset by a weak Chinese RMB. EBITDA of $1.3 billion improved 10% as favorable price, variable costs and equity affiliate income more than offset higher other costs. EBITDA was up in four of our five reporting segments. EBITDA margin jumped more than 700 basis points with lower energy cost pass-through contributing to about two thirds of the improvement. ROCE progressed steadily to reach 12%, which is 90 basis points higher than last year. We expect to maintain this steady progression as we continue bringing new projects on stream and put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been relatively flat at 13.4%. Sequentially, results improved primarily due to increased LNG sale of equipment activities as well as onsite. Now please turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $3.15 per share, up $0.30 or 11% compared to last year, due to strong pricing and higher equity affiliate income, partially offset by unfavorable costs. Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.44 this quarter, benefiting from both price actions and lower power costs. Cost has been unfavorable impact of $0.28 driven by higher inflation and higher maintenance as well as our ongoing efforts to support our growth strategy, including bringing new assets on stream. Accurate affiliate income was $0.19 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of the Jazan project and positive results from other unconsolidated joint ventures across the region. The remaining items including non-controlling interest, interest expense, and the tax rate together had a modest negative $0.03 impact. Now please turn to Slide 15. We remain committed to maintaining our current targeted A/A2 rating. And with our strong cash flow and additional debt leverage, we estimate that we can put more than $30 billion to work over the next 10 years. Today, we have a backlog over $19 billion with approximately $15 billion of projects focused on the energy transition. We believe that investing in these high return projects is the best way to create long-term shareholder value. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call to Dr. Serhan.
Samir Serhan: Thank you, Melissa. Given our first [ph] fourth quarter, we again saw broad based improvements across our businesses. Profits were favorable in four out of our five segments compared to the previous year. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, merchant price improved 10%, which corresponded to a 4% improvement for the overall region. Volumes grew 3% due to a strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA of just over $600 million improved 17% driven by strong price, volume and equity affiliate income while partially offset by higher cost. EBITDA margin of 44.5% jumped more than 1100 basis points. About two thirds of the margin improvement was driven by lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 6% mainly on better hydrogen volume. Now please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Asia segment results. Compared to last year, Asia volumes were negatively impacted by slower economic recovery in China, a weak electronics market and one-time opportunities that benefit last year results. Despite these volume headwinds, our teams maintained focus on price. EBITDA and margin were down primarily due to the unfavorable volumes. Sequentially price and volume were flat. However, EBITDA declined primarily due to unfavorable business mix. Please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Europe segment results. Compared to last year, our costs subsided while merchant pricing remained stable. Strong volumes in our onsite business were offset by weaker demand for merchant products resulting in flat volumes for the segment overall. EBITDA was up 15%, driven by the lower power cost and stronger currencies against the U.S. dollar which more than compensated for the other cost increases. EBITDA margin was 1000 basis points higher, approximately two thirds of which was due to the impact of lower energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, the region's EBITDA was relatively flat as higher volume was offset by unfavorable price and costs. Like we mentioned before, we brought the new project in Uzbekistan on stream last month earlier than previously anticipated. We expect this project to gradually ramp up and significantly contribute to growth in this segment going forward. Now please turn to Slide 19. Before we move on to the next roboting segment, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the recently announced largest blue hydrogen project in Europe. Blue hydrogen project is being developed in conjunction with Porthos CO2 Transport and Storage project in the Port of Rotterdam. But we have an extensive hydrogen pipeline network. Porthos will transport the CO2 emission from participating industrial companies and sequester them in depleted gas fields in the North Sea. Air Products will build, own and operate the carbon capture and CO2 treatment facility which will allow us to capture the emissions from our existing hydrogen facility as well as the customer refinery. The resulting low carbon hydrogen produce will be supplied to Exxon Mobil under a long-term off-take agreement. European regulations are supportive of low carbon projects. We have secured additional support from the Dutch Government. We expect the project to be on stream in 2026. Now please turn to Slide 20 for a review of our Middle East and India segment. Compared to last year, sales were lower due to lower volume. The second phase of the design project, which closed in mid-January of this year, added to equity affiliate income and it drove the region's overall results. Now please turn to Slide 21 for our Corporate and Other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. The sales and profit for this segment improved this quarter primarily due to higher LNG sale of equipment activities. We continue to have robust discussions with customer interested in our LNG technology and equipment. We were pleased to announce a significant and new project involving sale of equipment in Malaysia last week adding to our already robust project pipeline. Echoing Seifi and Melissa, the outstanding result this quarter again demonstrate the strength of our businesses. I also would like to thank our teams around the world for their hard work and commitment. I would like now to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Dr. Serhan. I appreciate that. Now please turn to Slide #22. We present this slide during every earning call because it is our core belief that the commitment and motivation of our people are the key drivers of our success. After all, technologies, processes and physical assets, which are often cited as competitive advantages, are all created by people in the organization. At Air Products, we have built an outstanding organization. Our people working together are creating innovative technologies, processes and facilities that are making us a first mover in supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon energy and decarbonizing the transportation and industrial sectors. We are doing this alongside our excellent core industrial gases business which is also underpinned by sustainability and delivering significant productivity and environmental benefits to our customers around the world. At Air Products, our higher purpose is to bring people together to collaborate and innovate solutions to significant energy and environmental challenges in our world. I can say that our entire team is focused on sustainable growth opportunities generating a cleaner future for humanity. With that, we are now ready to answer any of your questions and we welcome them. Operator, we are ready for questions please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take your first caller, John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess I wanted to dig into the Louisiana project a little bit more and the incremental $2.5 billion dollars of spend. I guess it sounds like there's a bunch of buckets including capitalized interest, taking over more utilities, kind of expanding the scope of the project. I guess, can you help us to put into buckets where the bulk of that $2.5 billion is going?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. John, excellent question. Number one, obviously, as we said, we announced this project two and a half years ago, everybody knows that there has been inflation, there is no skating that, and there will be inflation as we continue to do this project. The labor markets are tight. Some of the supply equipment and so on are tight. Therefore, there is significant inflation that we have had to deal with, and we have included that in the new capital project. Order of magnitude, I mean, let's say that it's about $1 billion or more is inflation. The rest of it is the fact that we have, as I said during the call, we have put in interest on capital. Obviously, as capital goes up, we do charge ourselves interest during our own capital, because otherwise, we would apply it under. So that is a significant part of that $2.5 billion. And then in addition to that, we have decided – because we see demand for this product being significant, that right now, some of the fundamental infrastructure, we want to build it bigger, so that when we want to expand, we don't have to build smaller units again, right? Things like water supply, things like land preparation, things like we bought additional 1,000 acres for expansion. So it's a combination of all of that, that adds up to the $2.5 billion, you would say, increase. We also have put in contingency and we have reviewed this thing in detail with our Board, and I'm very happy that they have supported us, but I keep going back to the fundamental issue that we are reiterating, but we are pleased, very carefully that we expect double-digit return now on $7 billion better than double-digit return on $4.5 billion. So if you want to look at it in a glass half full, we are actually going to make more money than before. John, I cannot overstress the fact that we see the demand for the product, materializing, it is serious. And as we go forward, we will be able to demonstrate that to you. But this is a very exciting project. It's a unique project. We are executing it. We are in the field and our people are very excited about it, and we are all very excited and very positive about this project.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color on that. And then I guess my second question would just be on the Netherlands project. It sounds like it's an interesting kind of emerging opportunity. Can you help us to think about how much capital may get put to work on that project and how you're thinking about the returns for it as well?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. I'm going to add Dr. Serhan will give you more color, but obviously, the return for that will be double digits as like anything else we do. But Dr. Serhan is very close to that project, and I'd like him to comment on that. Samir?
Samir Serhan: Thanks, Seifi. We're really not going to talk about the specific about the capital for the project. But again, it's a very exciting opportunity. It's our third project in our first mover advantage when it comes to blue hydrogen. We started with the net-zero blue hydrogen project in Edmonton, Canada, and we went to the Louisiana Darrow project. And now this is really the third and it's really the biggest also in Europe. Very excited about it with long-term off-take agreement with a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Esso. We capture -- we will capture CO2 from our existing hydrogen facility in the Port of Rotterdam and we will also capture CO2 from another Exxon hydrogen plan where we basically provided to Porthos to sequester under the North Sea. Again, emphasizing the double-digit return for the project and coming on to the…
John McNulty: Thanks very much for the color.
Samir Serhan: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
Operator: We'll hear next from John Roberts from Mizuho.
John Roberts: Thank you. Nice quarter. Staying on the blue hydrogen project in Europe, anything unique about the gas sourcing for that project? Given Europe's disadvantaged gas situation? And is that replacing existing hydrogen capacity? Or is your customer expanding their demand?
Seifi Ghasemi: I can answer that, and then if Dr. Serhan wants to add to that. But fundamentally, it is an existing plant that we have – existing plants that Exxon has. We have their technology and the know-how, we are going to put carbon capture on these existing units and capture the carbon and put it in this pipeline to go and be sequestered. So we are actually reducing CO2 emission into the air. This is not a new plant that people say, what you are building a new plant you are capturing the CO2, but you're not really reducing existing emission. This is really reducing existing emissions. And that is where our technology is, and that's where our know-how is. And therefore, it's a very positive project, it's received very positively. And it is a significant project. You don't want to disclose the exact amount because of the NDAs that we have. But it is not a $10 million project, but it's not a $2 billion project either, but it's a substantial amount of capital. Dr. Serhan, do you want to add in?
Samir Serhan: Again, it's really emphasizing no additional hydrogen. It's just really converting a gray hydrogen to blue hydrogen, and again, with full support of the Dutch government for low carbon and hydrogen.
John Roberts: And on the volume weakness in China, could you peel apart syngas versus electronics versus merchant boxline [ph]?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, that is a very, very good question. I've been trying to get a handle on that myself, which is not that easy, but where the weakness is. But there is obviously weakness in the electronics, but there is a weakness in the fundamental Chinese economy and we are beginning to see that. So I don't want to go through all of the details of the breakdowns, but we are seeing a general weakness. And hopefully, that trend will change, but that -- despite that, we are giving you the guidance that we are giving you, because we are saying that if the Chinese economy doesn't develop as well as it should, then what we will take additional productivity measures to make sure we deliver the guidance that we have given.
John Roberts: Great. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning. Seifi, I wanted to follow up on Louisiana in two ways. One, it sounds like some of the incremental CapEx will be spent now, but the benefits won't necessarily accrue to the company at the time the first phase starts up. So, I just want to understand, you'll have $7 billion of total CapEx spent when the project starts up. And traditionally, we think of your return coming to the company in that first year. Will you not get the full – would you not get the return on the full $7 billion of CapEx when you start up? Or you have to wait until Phase 2 to get some of the return on some of the infrastructure and real estate spend that you're doing incrementally?
Seifi Ghasemi: Vincent, excellent question. We are not going to leave any money on the table. We are going to price the product in such a way that we get double-digit return on the project on the $7 billion right from the start.
Vincent Andrews: And then secondly, if I – go ahead.
Seifi Ghasemi: No, no, after you.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about your Canadian project. I believe your – one of your off-take partners is also constructing a facility up there in part to use your product. And I believe that at an investor event earlier in September, where that project might be delayed. If that project is delayed, how does that impact Air Products economics and their ability to market their own product?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the way I would like to answer that is that first of all, we are committed to meeting the requirements of our customer. So whenever our customers comes on stream, we will have our plans ready for them. They are a very valued customer. You know who they are, Exxon, and they are one of our largest customers, and we have a lot of respect for them. And we worked with them very closely. In terms of if they are delayed, then we are ready not 100% of the product is going to them. We have other customers that we believe will be taking the product on time. We have a liquid hydrogen plant that we are going to feed. Therefore, we would expect that the effect on products would not be that material.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you very much for all the details. I appreciated.
Operator: We'll hear next from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi good morning. This is Steve Huang [ph] here for Dave. I guess, on the major project slide, are there any other material changes on other projects in terms of project cost and the time line that you haven't updated? And also, I guess, on project costs, if I think about the cost inflation on Louisiana project, that's about 20%. Why shouldn't that be the case for other projects that you have in your pipeline?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, with respect to other projects, there is no material change in the profitability of those projects that we want to bring to your attention now. And as I said in my call, with some of these bigger projects as we go forward in our earnings calls, we give you more detail about the different projects. The second thing is that if you take a look at the inflation thing, we -- one of the biggest projects we are executing was Jazan. That is already done. The next project, a big project was NEOM. We have already given you the capital for that, and we don't expect any significant inflation on that. That is in our backlog. Vidara [ph], we gave you the numbers right now. The projects that we are doing, the other projects that we are doing are in such a way that the return is connected to the capital. So even if the capital goes up, the return doesn't go down. So there is nothing that material to report at that stage.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. Yes. And then in F Q1, European pricing was down 1%. Is there any specific competitive dynamic that resulted in that 1% decline because I don't think you have a decline in pricing for a long time. And I think your peer is still seeing some price increase in Europe F Q4. Can you just talk about what's causing that and then your expectation on pricing in Europe and then just in general for next year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I would obviously love to answer your question in detail. But you know that we do have a very strong policy and we adhere to that. All of us at adhere to that. We do not talk about forward-looking on price. That is not appropriate in our industry, and we can talk to you about what has happened in the past, but we do not have any opinion or any suggestions about what is going to happen in the future. And so my apologies, I will not be able to answer that question following our policy and my Chief Legal Officer is nodding, he said that I'm doing the right thing.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Mike Leithead from Barclays.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning. First, I want to circle back on Louisiana. You just answered an earlier question, I think, talking about pricing the product appropriately to get your double-digit return upon startup, which is great. But when should investors expect the signed off-take agreement to help us get a bit more comfortable with the revenue stream from the projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, on that point, I have been very kind of -- very clear about what is our philosophy. We could have signed agreements, long-term agreements for selling that product two years ago. But we always said that we do not want to do that because as we go forward, it is going to become very clear to prospective customers that there are not that many plants or sources of low carbon – the level of low carbon intensity, hydrogen and blue ammonia that we are going to produce. And therefore, the value of our products will go higher. We are not in a hurry to sign long-term agreements. The demand is going to be there. But right now, if you are negotiating with any of these prospective customers, to be very frank, they give you a list of 20 projects that, oh, wait a minute, I can buy from this guy in the Middle East and this guy in Louisiana and this project and this project. All of those projects are paper projects. Nobody is doing anything. We are the only people who are actually building a plan. So we have another two years, three years before these plants come on stream. We should not be in a hurry to go and sell this stuff cheap just because that makes everybody feel happy. We – our business, our goal, our responsibility is to make as much money as we can for the shareholders. We think the value of these products will become higher as we get closer to where the demand is there, and there is not that many people who are supplying it. So do not expect for us to come in and make a big announcement about selling this product in the near future, because we are just not going to do that. We believe that the demand is there. Our customers know that the demand is there. It's just a little bit of a game about at what point people are going to come to the table, and we just don't think that right now is the time to do that. But obviously, at some point in time, we do want to sell the product, there's no question about that. But it's just the fact that we are trying to get the maximum value for the very unique product that we are going to be making. Nobody else in the world is producing this kind of product. And by the time this plant comes on stream, there is nobody else who is going to be producing this product at this scale because nobody has made the commitment and it takes a long time to develop these projects and build these projects.
Mike Leithead: Thank you for the very thoughtful answer. And then second, just a quick follow-up on cash flow maybe for Melissa. I think operating cash flow the past two years is about $3.2 billion, whereas CapEx is running about $5 billion, and the dividend is about $1.5 billion [indiscernible]. So leverage is obviously moving a bit higher short term. When in your multiyear outlook, would you expect that to peak out? Or when should we start to see operating cash flow helped by the project start to move meaningfully higher in your view?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'll make a general comment, and then I'll turn it over to Melissa to give you more details if necessary. But fundamentally, we have always been telling you that we are committed to maintaining our A rating. That means that we will not lever the company more than about 3.5 times. If we ever get to that stage, we'll stop doing projects. We are going to be responsible. We have significant opportunity. And as Melissa has shown you on the other slides, we still have a lot of headroom to lever the company before we run out of cash. But if we ever get to the stage, I just want to make the point, if we get to the stage that we are getting to the limit of 3.5 times then we would slow down on the projects. We are not going to be irresponsible and try to lever the company because we are very committed to our A rating. That is the general comment. Specifically, Melissa, do you want to add to that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Sure. Thanks, Seifi. Hi Mike, how are you? So as you mentioned, we do continue to have very strong cash flow to support our ongoing business. We do continue to increase dividends, which is our commitment and we are executing against our global project backlog. With that situation, because of the cash outlay, we do expect to go to the debt market this year -- this fiscal year. With that being said, as we bring these assets on stream, we will, of course, naturally be delevered. So that will be a decrease in our leverage and obviously, we'll continue to maintain at A/A2 rating as Seifi mentioned. So again, likely will go out this year with the cash needs, but we do feel very comfortable that we will stay within that two times leverage so that we can maintain our AA2 rating.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. The working capital was a use of $424 million this year and your undistributed earnings of equity method investments was negative $260 million [ph]. So if you add that up, that $685 million, that was pulled away from cash from operations. And so your cash flow was flat year-over-year. For 2024, what do you expect the $3.5 billion, $4 billion, more than $4 billion is working capital and outflow or an inflow? Can you explain your cash flow dynamics for next year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning Jeff, as usual you are asking a very good and a very detailed question. And I'm going to refer that details to Melissa to give you some color on that. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate your questions, and you always definitely have very interesting and detailed questions. So as we mentioned, we do still have a very strong cash inflow. This year, we had a few significant large cash outflows, including the closing of our Phase 2 for Jazan that happened in January. However, with that being said, working capital is still being largely funded by our ongoing influent trade activities. This year, as we mentioned, we do expect to have CapEx at around $5 billion to $5.5 billion, which is not far off where we were this year, including the closing of the Jazan joint venture. So we are very comfortable given our current cash flow that we will be able to meet ongoing working capital needs as well as execute against our growth strategy.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. All right. For my follow-up, if your investment in Louisiana is going to be $7 billion, is that $7 billion to be spent by 2026? And so should we assume that your CapEx in 2025 and 2026 should be higher than the $5 billion to $5.5 billion range you've got for 2024?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, I'll take that question. We have announced officially today that we expect the project cost to be $7 billion. We have not announced that we expect that Air Products will spend $7 billion of building the project. We can, as we go forward and we sign long-term agreements to sell the product, we can and we will seriously consider like we did with NEOM to lever the project and finance the project. So you might end up that out of the $7 billion our actual cash outlay for the project might be $2 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion, not $7 billion. So there is a possibility of doing that. Please don't forget that. So we are -- we have the capacity to spend our own cash, but we would rather project finance these products so that we have more cash for future projects. And this -- they have demonstrated, we did this with Jazan, where it was a $12 billion project and the project finance that. We have done that with NEOM. And there is a good possibility, I'm not saying 100%, but there is a good possibility that we will do that with this project, which is a very interesting project and very amenable to having project finance. Okay, Jeff?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: Moving next to Marc Bianchi from TD Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: Hi. Thank you. I'd first like to ask for an update on the NEOM project. Can you talk about progress there, remind us of the time line and any updates on potential off-take agreements?
Seifi Ghasemi: Our NEOM project is moving forward very nicely. We are certainly almost done with the engineering. We are actually constructing the plant. We have, as you saw an announcement today by a NEOM Green Hydrogen company that they are taking delivery of the wind turbines. So that project is expected. But right now, the time line that we have announced is at the end of 2026, beginning of 2027, and we fully expect to meet that deadline. So that -- in terms of discussions about the uptake, again, there are comments that I made about Louisiana apply to that. But also at the same time, there has been public announcements by other people about their demand for green hydrogen in Europe? You saw that one of the largest oil companies in the world announced that they will need 500,000 tons of green hydrogen by 2030, just to put it in perspective, 500,000 tons is equivalent of three times the capacity of NEOM. So there is going to be plenty of demand for that project but we will wait, as I said, in terms of our strategy to price that appropriately so that we can get appropriate return on that project.
Marc Bianchi: Okay, thank you Seifi. That's a great overview. Thank you. The other question I had was on the targeting greater than 10% internal rate of return. Does that suggest that there's – this is an upgrade from your prior messaging of sort of an EBIT contribution of 10% of the project cost? And does this now include the benefit of IRA, I believe, before the comment was that you were not including the benefit of IRA?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it's a combination of all of that. We have always said that 10% IRA is the minimum. That really translates to what you said, $0.10 of operating profit on a dollar of investment. Those two go together. We do expect, and we have demonstrated that. Now that you have all of the detailed numbers, please take a look at the return we are getting on Jazan. In Jazan, it's a $12 billion project. And if you look carefully, you'll find out that in terms of IRR, the return on that is more than 15%. So we obviously, as I said, the price our products not based on just the return, the price is based on what the market bears. And -- but if it goes below 10%, you usually don't do the projects unless it is phenomenally strategic and we don't have that -- too many of those. So overall, the 10% IRR is our minimum. And we expect most of our projects to produce more than that.
Marc Bianchi: And the inclusion of benefit from IRA?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the IRA, it depends on which project and how much it affects that and all of that. But IRA obviously, we've had. But as you know, IRA was designed in such a way that we would be able to get a good return, but also price the product to encourage the customers to use that because it was an incentive for that. So it's going to help both sides.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Mike Sison from Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter and outlook. I apologize. I just want to ask Louisiana again. Maybe I just don't understand. So I take the $7 billion and then your normal 10% of capital should be applied on the $7 billion? Or is that less than $7 billion?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the rule of time thumb that we said you should expect once that plant is fully operational you should expect if we have financed that ourselves and the $7 billion is our money, you should expand the $700 million uplift on the operating income of our products. But as I said, we might decide to project finance it, which, in that case, it will be in accordance with how much cash we put in there. But if it was our money you should expect $700 million.
Mike Sison: Okay. And then given that the cost has gone up from 4 5% to 7%, is the pricing assumption on what you're going to sell has that changed? And does that 10% return change on a certain price that you need to get for the product?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, we believe that – but this is why our Board approved the project at $7 billion because they see that we expect that we will be able to sell the product at a price and at a premium to get that return. Look, it is not very difficult for the investors to take pen to pencil and just go through order of magnitude that plant to make it simple, assume it is making 3.5 million ton a year of blue ammonia. Assume a price for blue ammonia, you know where the price of gray is obviously, blue is going to be higher than that and then see what the revenue is. And then the cost, it is natural gas costs that you can calculate; it is operating cost that you can calculate, its electricity cost that you can calculate very easily. And then by the time you get done with the math, you'll find out that, that plant has – at a reasonable price for blue ammonia, it can easily make more than $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion of EBITDA. So then that or $7 billion becomes a decent return project. So it is not difficult to actually do the calculation. Right now, you know the price of gray ammonia is. But it is not very difficult to convince yourself that, that project is a very, very good project. The important thing for Air Products is to execute the project and bring the project, get the permit for the classic, well, do the sequestration, those are the execution is the challenge for us, but I think the rest of it will work out very nicely.
Mike Sison: Understand. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. Seifi, about three weeks ago, the U.S. Government announced its intention to establish seven regional hydrogen hubs at a cost of $7 billion to be funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law. Be curious to hear your thoughts on that program. I believe you're involved with the so-called Arches [ph] project or hub in California. On the one hand, I suppose this accelerate some market development. On the other hand, there are many dozens of partners in these hubs, some of which might be customers; others might be existing competitors or possibly future competitors. So maybe you can put that into context for us in terms of your involvement and how you see that market developing?
Seifi Ghasemi: For that particular project, which is part of the infrastructure project, we have never really emphasized that too much because that in terms of helping what we are doing is not comparable to the IRA. It is $7 billion spread over a lot of different projects. By the time it gets to any one-off individual company and so on, the amount is not that much to move in either. We obviously welcome any kind of investment to promote the use of hydrogen. That is a positive thing. But in terms of any kind of a material – we are part of the [indiscernible] in, I mean, they have an NDA, we cannot talk about it that much. But fundamentally, that contribution from that infrastructure bill, as you said, $7 billion divided by all of these projects is not going to move the needle for us in terms of what we were or we were not going to do that. We have never counted that as being anything significant. That is not comparable anything like the IRA because with the IRA, it becomes very meaningful when you start. We are sequesting in Louisiana, 5 million ton of CO2 at $80, that's $400 million a year of contribution. Obviously, it costs some money to sequester is. But as I said, the numbers are not comparable. So on the infrastructure bill, we have always said it's a good thing. It obviously is a good thing, it's better than nothing, but it's not something that will make any material difference to what we are doing or not doing.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you for that. And then secondly, if I may, would you comment on your outlook for the corporate and other line. It came down quite a bit in the fiscal fourth quarter, and you've been active on LNG. So maybe you can comment on the forward profile for LNG as well as the controllable expenses flowing through that line in 2024.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. I have made this statement in the last quarter, and I'd like to reiterate that, that we do have programs in order to control our corporate cost. We had a significant amount of corporate costs in 2023 because we were pursuing a lot of projects and starting up a lot of projects, those things do cost money, we don't expect that the amount will be as much in 2024. In addition, the fact that our LNG business and so on and the other businesses are doing well, will help on that. So we do expect a reduction of that corporate cost in 2024 versus 2023, quite a significant amount.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Moving on to Stephen Byrne from Bank of America.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Was the strength in hydrogen demand during the quarter in the Americas, specifically in your U.S. Gulf Coast pipeline? And if so, what fraction of those pipeline customers are you in dialogue with about switching them from gray to blue? And if the demand outlook in that region for Blue hydrogen is so robust, are you – might you potentially consider reducing the design and scope of the Louisiana project and drop the ammonia piece of it, which would include the offshore port and so forth in addition to an ammonia reactor?
Seifi Ghasemi: You are asking a very, very good question. I do not expect that we would get to the stage that we would drop the ammonia part because there will be a robust demand for blue ammonia. But you are very right, the demand for blue hydrogen is growing in that part of the world. We are engaged with all of the customers and the interesting thing is that if we ever expand the project, that is where we can focus more on what you said that maybe produce more blue hydrogen than trying to produce more ammonia. So overall, the story is very positive, as you said, and the fact that Air Products has a 700-mile hydrogen pipeline in that part of the world gives us significant advantage in being able to optimize this. But that is a very good position to be. And I think you're pointing out a very good point.
Stephen Byrne: And then one follow-on with respect to the Netherlands blue hydrogen project, I believe Air Liquide is also involved in a project with Porthos. And my question for you is, as Netherlands is moving in this direction of blue hydrogen, do you see potential that the rest of Europe might relax its preference for green and embrace blue more?
Seifi Ghasemi: Right now, the blue hydrogen project in Netherlands is very practical because you do have these steam methane reformers there, and it's very efficient to capture the CO2 from the and produce blue hydrogen, it's better than the gray hydrogen. But I do not think that, that signals that the fundamental demand for new applications in Europe, especially for mobility and for some of the refineries will go to blue. I think green hydrogen will still be – will end up being a preference for Europe, as you have seen in the announcement of some of the major possible users. So I think it will be a combination of the two.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. [Indiscernible]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from Josh Spector from UBS.
Chris Perrella: Hi, good morning. It's Chris Perrella on for Josh. A follow-up on, I guess, the volume outlook for this coming year with volumes in Asia down and some of the one-off deals that you did in 2023 rolling off, what are the volume assumptions underpinning your guidance for this coming year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, on that point, the way we have looked at this thing and – it's very difficult to obviously predict the future. But overall, the way we have looked at this thing that you know that our business is very much related to – not to GDP but to industrial production. So the way we have kind of budgeted ourselves is that industrial production in the U.S. will be positive. And not double digit or anything like that. Last year, it was about 2.5%, something like that, maybe a little bit less than that. So positive in the U.S., flat in Europe, and down in Asia. That's the very much overall economic condition under which we have produced the guidance for next year.
Chris Perrella: All right. And one quick follow-up on the Rotterdam project. How should we think about the capital spend? And will – with Porthos taking the CO2 from you, what's the cost involved in having them essentially dispose of it?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, they are going to charge us $10 per ton for disposing the CO2, which we will obviously pass through to our customers. We wouldn't be paying for that. And then we obviously – we have a charge for our capital, and then there is a charge for the sequestration. And I don't think we are at liberty to quote the number that Porthos is going to charge us but at some point in time, they might decide to make that public.
Samir Serhan: But the Dutch government providing incentives for the CO2 sequestration.
Seifi Ghasemi: But Dr. Serhan is adding that the Dutch government is also contributing on the cost for the sequestration.
Chris Perrella: All right. Is there a capital – a rough capital number for this -- for the carbon capture?
Seifi Ghasemi: We haven't disclosed that. We are not allowed to disclose that. But as I said, it is more than $100 million and less than $1 billion, so somewhere in between.
Chris Perrella: Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: So sorry about that. We are not allowed to disclose the number. Okay.
Chris Perrella: All right. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much. Okay. With that, I think we have significantly gone over time. Is there anybody else in the queue, operator?
Operator: At this time, there are no additional callers in the queue.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Well, with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call today. We appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Stay safe, stay healthy and all the best, and have a great day.
Operator: That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-08-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar. Please go ahead.
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' third quarter 2023 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings and capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide number 2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. The committed and dedicated people of Air Products, delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter driven by a strong organic sales growth, demonstrating the strength and stability of our business. At Air Products, we have an excellent and resilient industrial gas business, that is the foundation of who we are and what we do. We supply customers in dozens of industries. Customers would depend on our people's expertise to make their products and processes more efficient and sustainable. We have been doing this for the last 83 years, and we will continue to do all we can to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the Board, providing outstanding service to our customers. But at the same time, we are using all of our experience, financial strength, and core competencies as the Board's leading supplier of hydrogen. We'll implement our low and zero-carbon hydrogen megaprojects around the world. When it comes to generating a cleaner future now, we want to lead the way, decarbonizing heavy-duty transportation and heavy industry around the world, with clean hydrogen at very larger scale. This combination is our growth strategy, and it is the path forward for our continuous success and profitable growth in the quarters and years to come. I want to thank the hardworking and talented team at Air Products, we make all of this possible. Now please turn to Slide number 3, our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. We have worked hard to realize significant progress since 2014, but we always drive and strive to do even better. Our goal is to achieve zero incidents and zero accidents. Now, please turn to Slide number 4, which summarizes our management philosophy. We have shown you this slide every time that we have an earning call. But I cannot emphasize enough our commitment to the basic principles delineated in these slides. These principles will guide our actions in the future. Now please turn to Slide number 5. Our third-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.98 per share improved $0.40 or 16% versus last year and exceeded the top end of our guidance for the quarter. Both price and volume were again positive. We continued to demonstrate significant pricing strength while our volume improved for the ninth consecutive quarter, driven by strong onsite performance, including improved hydrogen demand in Americas and over 30 new assets that we have brought onstream. Additionally, we anticipate the recently announced $1 billion acquisition of the natural gas-to-syngas facility in Uzbekistan and the new LNG sale of equipment projects will add significantly to our future earnings. As you can see on this slide, we have delivered an average of 11% cumulative average growth rate of earnings per share in the last nine years. Now please turn to Slide number 6. We are committed to rewarding our investors by providing a healthy dividend and return cash to them. We are proud of our record of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increases. We expect to return more than $1.5 billion of dividend to our shareholders in 2023 and also this slide demonstrates that we have increased our dividend by an average of 10% in the last nine years. Now please turn to Slide number 7, which shows our EBITDA margin. This continues to be my favorite chart. This graph is self-explanatory and clearly demonstrates the significant improve of our margins as compared to nine years ago when I had the honor and privilege of becoming the Chairman, President, and CEO of Air Products. Now please turn to Slide number 8. I would like to again highlight the two fundamental pillars of our growth strategy. Our resilient core industrial gas business and the low-and zero-carbon hydrogen projects, the mega projects each underpinned by sustainability. By running our existing business efficiency every quarter, we were able to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in eight of the last quarters. And we continue to advance our blue and green hydrogen projects to help decarbonize the transportation and the heavy industrial sector of our economy. We expect these world-scale green hydrogen project to significantly add to our already strong profit stream in the future. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi has said, the consistency and resilience of our business was on full display this quarter. Price and volume gained 4% and 3%, respectively, at all profit metrics were up again double-digits over last year in a difficult environment. Thanks to the people of Air Products for your continued commitment to serving our customers around the world. We are proud that our NEOM Green Hydrogen joint venture, the world's largest green hydrogen production facility achieved financial close in May. The joint venture successively secured over $6 billion of non-recourse financing from over 20 global project finance leaders. The project was two times over-subscribed, a clear demonstration of confidence in this project. Now please turn to Slide 9, for our view of our third quarter results. In comparison to last year, volume increased 3%, driven primarily by our on-site business. Merchant price was 10% higher compared to last year, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This equates to a 4% price gain for the total company, with positive pricing across all regions. Declining natural gas costs in Europe and the Americas reduce energy cost pass-through to our on-site customers. This 11% decline in sales had no impact on profit but had a positive impact on margins. The overall impact of currency was modest however, Asian currencies were particularly weaker and contributed to slightly unfavorable currency impact against the U.S. dollar. EBITDA improved 12%, as strong price and equity affiliate income, including the contribution from the second phase of the Jazan project, that closed in January, more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin jumped almost 600 basis points, with lower energy cost passthrough, accounting for two-thirds of the margin improvement. ROCE progressed steadily to reach 12%, which is a 130 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects onstream and continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.6% this quarter. Sequentially, favorable volume and price net of variable costs drove improvement to the EBITDA and EBITDA margin, lower energy cost pass through also benefited EBITDA margin by about 200 basis points. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our earnings per share. Our third quarter GAAP earnings of $2.67 per share included two non-GAAP items that together negatively impacted EPS by $0.30 per share. First, we recorded a $0.23 charge for business and asset action. Second, the non-service components of our defined benefit plan resulted in a $0.07 cost this year versus a $0.03 gain last year. Excluding these non-GAAP items, our third quarter adjusted earnings was $2.98 per share up $0.40 or 60% compared to last year, driven by strong pricing and higher equity affiliate income. Price and volume and costs added $0.34 to our third quarter adjusted earnings. Price, net of variable costs contributed $0.52 this quarter, and volume - improvement contributed an additional $0.09. Costs were unfavorable $0.27, driven by inflation, as well as our ongoing efforts to support our growth strategy, including bringing new bringing new assets on stream. Equity affiliates' income was $0.18 higher due to the contribution of the second phase of Jazan project, and good results from our other unconsolidated joint ventures in the Americas and Europe. The remaining items, including non-controlling interest, interest expense, and non-operating income and expense together had a minus negative $0.06 impact. We expect our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%. Now please turn to Slide 11. Our ability to steadily grow distributable cash flow, especially in challenging conditions, is a hallmark of the strength and stability of our businesses and underpins our divided and capital deployment programs. Over the last 12 months, we have generated about $3.2 billion of distributable cash flow or over $14 per share. We prioritized over 45% of - or about $1.5 billion as dividends to our shareholders, while still having roughly $1.8 billion to invest for growth. Now please turn to Slide 12. We have made significant progress in developing or deploying our capital since 2018, committing most of our estimated investable capacity available in 2018 to the 2027 timeframe. Because our strategy related to the energy transition extends well beyond 2027, We have revised this slide to show a rolling 10-year time horizon. We have not changed any other assumptions or calculations. We remain committed to maintaining our current targeted AA2 rating with our strong cash flow and additional debt leverage, we estimate that we can put more than $30 billion to work over the next 10 years. Today, we have an $18 billion backlog with $11 billion of projects focused on the energy transition. We believe that investing in these high return projects is the best way to create long-term shareholder value. Now to begin the review of our Business segment results. I'll turn the call over to Dr. Serhan.
Samir Serhan: Thank you, Melissa. During our fiscal third quarter, we again saw broad-based improvements across our businesses, extending the positive trend from previous quarters. Results improved in each of our regional segments versus last year, driven by strong price, strong volume, productivity actions, despite the challenging operating conditions around the world. Before I discuss the results of each region, I would like to provide a brief update on our major projects. First, turning to Slide 13. You will see that, we have enhanced how we present our major projects, clarifying the project investment amounts, specifying the long-term nature of the related offtake agreements, and highlighting energy transition projects. We believe this new format provides a clear overview of key projects in our backlog and provide near-term and long-term visibility. Now please turn to Slide 14. I'm pleased to say that the Jiutai gasification project is in operation. Our team executed the project in the midst of COVID lockdown and supply chain disruption, including several months of severe lockdowns during the start-up period. We were able to complete, this complex project with outstanding safety performance and come in under budget. The team of over 3,300 workers during peak construction completed nearly 13 million hours without a lost time incident. I would like - to thank the team for a job well done. Our team in the America has also overcome many challenges to execute the Gulf Coast ammonia project, which had nearly 1,300 workers during peak construction and completed over a 3 million hours without a lost time incident. The facility is currently in a start-up and we expect to begin delivering hydrogen to our pipeline system this month. Finally, following many years of hard work, we announced the $1 billion acquisition of the natural gas-to-syngas plant in Uzbekistan. As part of one of the most advanced energy plants in the world. This acquisition include the two largest auto-thermal reformer in the world in short ATR. This is the same ATR technology, we're deploying in our net zero energy complex Edmonton, Canada. This will further enhance our industry leading hydrogen production capabilities driven by our own partial oxidation technology in short POX, P-O-X. This is the technology, we have acquired from GE several years ago. This POX technology which we are deploying in our clean energy complex in Louisiana has been a proven mainstay for efficient syngas generation for many decades. We will operate multiple POX units at the Louisiana facility, each of which will be the world's largest. POX and ATR are the two leading processes for the production of a blue hydrogen. Having the capability and the flexibility to use both leading technology to produce a blue hydrogen at world scale will further extend our leadership in low carbon hydrogen production. Now please turn to Slide 15. For a review of our Americas segment's results. Compared to last year, Americas EBITDA was up 18% driven by higher price and volume. Merchant price improved 11%, which corresponded to 4% improvement for the region overall. Volume grew 6%, driven by on-site including strong demand for hydrogen. EBITDA margin jumped more than 1,100 basis points driven by strong price, lower energy costs pass through, which drove about three quarters of the margin improvement. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 10%, mainly on better hydrogen volume and lower variable costs. Lower energy costs pass through also drove roughly around two-thirds of the margin improvement. Now please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Asia's segment results. Our results in Asia improved despite the currency headwinds for recovery in China and higher energy costs across the region. Compared to last year, EBITDA was up 10% despite a 5% negative currency impact. Positive price and volume more than offset higher costs. Merchant price increased 9% which more than offset higher variable costs. Volume improved 8%, primarily to better onsite, including the addition of over 30 new assets in the past year. Our activities in the electronics sector [indiscernible] calendar robust accounting for many of the new projects. We also added projects in the chemical, glass, and other applications. Sequentially, volume was up 2%, following the Lunar New Year holidays. Please now turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Europe segment results. Our team in Europe has worked hard to maintain positive momentum. Compared to last year EBITDA increased more than 20%, driven by the impact of our pricing actions. Merchant price improved 10%, which equates for a - towards 6% gain for the overall region. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit merchant price gains for the region. Volume was up modestly, on better onsite. This is particularly driven by improvement in hydrogen. This more than offset weaker demand for merchant products. EBITDA margin was about 800 basis points higher and included the impact of lower energy costs pass-through, which benefited margin by around 300 basis points. Sequentially, the region's EBITDA held is steady, as favorable energy costs offset the lower price. Lower energy cost pass-through also benefited EBITDA margin by about 150 basis points. Now please turn to Slide 18 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Compared to last year, our merchant volume and price pushed sales higher, but the increased costs negatively impacted operating income. The second phase of the Jazan project, which we closed in mid-January of this year added to our equity affiliate income, and it drove the region's overall results. The Jazan project has contributed as we expected, consistent with our commitment. Please now turn to Slide 19 for our Corporate and other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses, as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. The sales and profit for this segment were lower this quarter due to lower sale of equipment activities and higher cost resulting from ongoing support for our growth strategy. We do however continue to have robust discussions with customers interested in our LNG technology and equipment. But I'm pleased to announce two significant sale of equipment project wins with Qatargas and NextDecade. This is in addition to the two project wins announced in May. We plan to expand our production facility in Florida again and expect increasing LNG project activities to improve the segment results. Echoing what Seifi and Melissa have mentioned earlier, the outstanding results this quarter again showed the resilience of our people and our businesses. I also would like to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of our teams around the world. I would like now to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide number 20. Our third quarter results exceeded our previous guidance. However, the outlook for economic conditions around the world remain uncertain. We have again raised our fiscal year 2023 guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint of $11.40 to $11.50 earnings per share for the year versus the $11.30 to $11.50, we had provided last quarter For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share guidance is $3.04 to $3.14, up 7% to 10% over last year. We still see our CapEx for the year to be about $5 billion $5.5 billion. Now please turn to Slide number 21. The people of Air Products are passionate about helping to solve the more significant energy and environmental challenges. Their commitment and motivation continues to drive our performance. In our core industrial gases business, we are demonstrating continued strength and resiliency even against a soft economic backdrop. And we continue to bring plants online and enter a new phase where we will bring additional larger-scale projects onstream. This as a result of that, we see a great future for Air Products, and that is what makes all of us very excited about working here and being part of the global energy transition movement. At this time, we will be delighted to answer your questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Seifi, one of my emerging favorite slides is Slide 12 for what it's worth. Specifically the estimated future capacity in terms of what you can allocate the projects in the coming years. Can you - I understand this is a very fluid situation, but can you just kind of help us with the thought process around how much you believe could or will be allocated to projects oriented to the U.S. IRA? Or something along those lines, just to help us really think about the next few years on that capital allocation process? Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Chris. You are asking a very good question. We provided this slide to give you a 10-year view because we are at a long-term strategy and we wanted investors to get as clear a view of the future as we can provide right now. We obviously appreciate that there is a very dynamic situation about different projects in different parts of the world. So I'd like to say, that the comment that I make is based on what we know today. Based on that, I think a significant part of that investment is going to be in the United States, as a result of the IRA and the opportunities that that creates for us. But obviously, the Board is developing different people or coming up with different projects and all of that, and we participate in those. But right now I would say that a significant part of that $30 billion will be investments in the United States that we have already committed to and we will commit as we go forward. Okay, Chris?
Christopher Parkinson: That's fantastic. Thank you so much. And just a very quick - as a very quick follow-up, can you just give us just a very brief overview, there is three questions. I'll take - the buy side inclusive of obviously longer-term holders, just the update on the Jazan 2 ramp, obviously, I think, I believe that started in January between that Gulf Coast Ammonia and Jiutai, those all trending basically in-line with your expectations. Just trying to compartmentalize those names as we're thinking about fiscal year '24. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: I'm just trying to make sure I understood your question because the sound wasn't that good.
Christopher Parkinson: Yes. Is Jazan performing as expected?
Seifi Ghasemi: I would like to have - Dr. Serhan is the Chairman of the Company, that we have formed to run Jazan, so I'd like to turn it over to him to answer the question.
Samir Serhan: Yes, Chris, everything is going as it planned really since we took over the group to assets. We've been commissioning them, putting them on-stream. And really supplying the product to power to the grid and supplying also products like hydrogen to the refinery and steam. So things are really going well with that project. I mean, we're really fortunate to have a very strong 800 people doing this - running that facility.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from David Wong with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Wong: Hi. I guess you have very strong margins this quarter in Europe. How sustainable are those margin levels, then how should we think about those going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for the question. Obviously, from my point of view, I hope it is sustainable for a very long-time. But obviously, time will tell. We as you know very well, as a matter of policy do not comment on forward pricing. We comment on, what the pricing that we have achieved, but we don't comment on forward pricing. So our goal is to maintain our margins as high as possible and create as much value for our shareholders. But it is that - I don't want to make any predictions. Dr. Serhan, do you have any additional comments on that?
Samir Serhan: I mean, really the team in Europe has been doing an outstanding job. I mean, we deal with all of the challenges in Europe about the war, about energy cost fluctuation. But no doubt about it, the industrial output in Europe is not growing at all. I mean, and that is definitely a challenge that we're monitoring. But to make - I mean, some of the segments we support is better than last year. We see a gradual improvement in electronics, with some of the customers there. The low natural gas pricing, we see some of the chemical-defining fertilizer business are picking-up activity. Construction is still challenging there, which helps our package business that it's still really down compared to previous years. So, again measured costs.
David Wong: Okay, thank you. And then in your corporate costs for this quarter, how much was the increase loss from lower equipment sales? And then how much was from increased investment spending?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'd like to turn that over to Melissa to answer. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: So, thank you very much, Seifi. So just to make sure I understand your question, you're asking what was the additional contribution from our sale of equipment.
David Wong: Just your corporate costs overall, it's higher than the prior year. I guess, how much was from lower equipment sales? And then how much was from increased investment spending this quarter?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you very much. So I think you asked a great question and I will focus on cost, not just within our corporate segment, but perhaps across our organization. So a portion of our costs are really associated with our good results. We increased our variable pay program across our organization, as our results come in positively. Additionally, like most organizations, we continue to feel the burden of the wage inflation across the organization. Finally, another notable contribution is the fact that we have several plans that are pre-onstream for commissioning phases. This obviously adds to our headcount in preparation for the onstream of those plans, which will add to our cost stack for a period, without support from the program - or from the invoicing of those plants. So those three combined is really where you see the cost increase across the organization.
David Wong: Okay. Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Your increased demand that you're seeing in hydrogen, just curious which of your pipelines are you seeing that from and are these your legacy refining customers or is this from renewable fuel? And would any of those customers justify your installing some carbon capture in the near term to generate some blue hydrogen for those customers?
Seifi Ghasemi: Dr. Serhan, you want to answer that?
Samir Serhan: Yes. Steve, good question. We really see the demand for hydrogen, it's really significant. I mean, the main driver for us, for our business is - because you know that, we have the biggest network in the world in the U.S. Gulf Coast. That's really fully utilized. I mean, we have there more demand than we can really supply. And definitely, there is also demand for lower carbon and hydrogen for the renewable diesel refinery. So it's been really very robust, we see some activity also picking up, the hydrogen also in our Rotterdam pipeline system there. The same thing we see it in Canada, California. So it's overall really been robust, that mean the demand for hydrogen with also some buckets for low-carbon hydrogen.
Steve Byrne: Okay, I'm just curious - yes. Yes. Thank you. With respect to NEOM, have you reassessed whether or not you need to invest downstream in distribution? It's been three years since you announced that project and you at that time you were thinking you would need to build some downstream pipeline capacity for the green ammonia. Do you have a view now of where you might be able to sell that green hydrogen from NEOM?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, we do. And that we have announced some of it, and I can elaborate on that right now. We see a significant demand for that product in Europe because it is - it being very clear with the policies that has been finalized in Europe, that they were not finalized even two years ago. Europe, basically most of Europe, especially Germany has decided to go green. As a result of that, we plan to build at least three terminals in Europe. One in Hamburg, one in Rotterdam, and one in Immingham in England, to bring the product - their ammonia into those ports, associated and then sell it or mobility and for industrial applications. We might add additional terminals. In addition to that, there is a demand, a potential demand for that green hydrogen and other green hydrogen that we might make in the United States. And we are making in the United States in the State of California, because of the regulations that have been put in place, in terms of conversion to very low-emission vehicles. Therefore, the possibility and another terminal also in California. That is our current plan, but this is a dynamic situation, the regulations around the world continue changing. And as that develops, we will obviously update you. There is significant demand being generated and being discussed in Korea. It is obviously the demand for blue hydrogen in Japan and all of that. But we will update you as we go forward, but that is how we see it today.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay?
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. Hi, Seifi. I'll just ask one question here. When do you think we'll get the first conversion of an existing U.S. hydrogen plant from gray to blue?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, that is an excellent question. I can definitely confirm that we are working on that. I do not want to predict an exact time and schedule because we are talking to customers and it is sensitive, and they don't really want us to talk about these things too much. But as you know better than anybody else, have significant number of SMRs in the United States that generate CO2, and we are very interested in capturing the CO2, from as many of them as possible. And with the help of the IRA and the demand, and the higher prices that people are willing to pay for blue hydrogen, we have a significant opportunity on that. And we will do that. Dr. Serhan, do you want to make any additional comments on that?
Samir Serhan: No, it's fine. Nothing to add.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thanks.
John Roberts: Right. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, John?
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Hi, good morning, Seifi. I wanted to - 
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. How are you doing?
John McNulty: I'm great. I'm great. Hopefully, you are as well. Wanted to ask on the Uzbek project, that you're bringing on. I guess, I guess a couple of questions on that. Can you help us to understand, because it looks like it comes on at some point relatively early in '24, but -- so can you help us to understand the timing of it? And also the EPS contribution that you expect it to give, as you look to 2024? And then I guess also tied to that project, yes, how do you think about the returns for - I know you look for a 10% plus return, but I also know you risk adjust those as well. So, I guess, how should we be thinking about that for the Uzbek project?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I will - I'll make some general comments and then I'll turn it over to Dr. Serhan to kind of elaborate even more in detail. But we expect that project, which is a very good project as Dr. Serhan mentioned, that project has the largest ATRs in the world and we are very happy to own it now. We expect contribution from that project in our bottom line for sure in 2024 - in our fiscal year 2024. In terms of the exact number, obviously, I can't give you the exact number, but order of magnitude, order of magnitude we expect a contribution of about $0.35 per share at least. So Dr. Serhan would you like to comment.
Samir Serhan: It starts really with what is really included in this acquisition. So this is really the two largest world scale ATRs in the world. There is also a hydrogen unit through a large air separation units around 12,000 tonne per day. The plant is already built, it's in the process being commissioned right now and that's why we see it is going to be a set of our earnings next year 2024 and it would be fully in the numbers for 2025. Again, we're very proud of the project and really operating those ATRs with Haldor Topsoe technology is really going to give us lots of know-how about how to really optimize our positioning in blue hydrogen in the future.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, John?
John McNulty: Got it. Perfect. No, thanks for the color. And then maybe just as the follow-up, you've got the Alberta project or Edmonton project coming on next year. It does seem like the demand for clean hydrogen is picking up in the region. Is that project sold out at this point based on the contracts that you've locked up?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, on that front, we have announced, what the signing of a long-term contract with Imperial Oil, which is part of Exxon, and we have given you the details of that. The rest of it we have very clear visibility to where we are going to sell it. So I think it's a matter of semantics when you say sold out, that means contracts that have been signed and finalized for the fact that we feel that it is going to be sold out. So we feel very strongly that we will sell all of that product and we might actually need more than that. I'd like to have Dr. Serhan to make some comments about where we are on this thing and any additional color.
Samir Serhan: Thanks, Seifi. IOL is the anchor customer for this project. We're working together with them to bring our respective facilities onstream. Please note the products out of this project will go into our existing pipeline systems, which we have a system in Edmonton, Canada. And this will be feeding IOL, our customers and also hydrogen for mobility because we are building a fueling station also they have to use low-carbon hydrogen for mobility. It's going very well. I mean, working very closely with IOL as the anchor customer.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, John?
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks. Thanks very much for the color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Mike Sison: Hi, good morning guys. Yes, just one question, when you think about 2024 or next year. How much earnings growth, you get some projects that are coming on-stream. And this CapEx go up next year because of you have such a big backlog of growth projects.
Seifi Ghasemi: In terms of 2024, and what comes from there, I would - I appreciate if you have some patience and we will disclose that to you in - at the end of October, obviously. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But in terms of our CapEx, our expectation today is that our CapEx next year will be approximately $5 billion to $5.5 billion, the same as this year. That is based on what we know today. Okay, Mike?
Mike Sison: Understood. Yes, thank you. Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just first on the Canada Blue Hydrogen project, just the slide that you updated on the backlog, maybe has a little bit less of a discreet timing elements out there. Do you still expect that in 2024, and I guess, fiscal '24 for you guys or has anything changed there? And same thing with the SAP project, has that moved from 2025 to 2026, or is the timing relatively unchanged?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well - I'd just like to - with respect to the project in Canada, as Dr. Serhan said, that project when it comes onstream, we are committed to process and supply hydrogen to IOL. So we can only do that when their plant comes onstream. But in addition to that, we do have our pipeline, we do have existing customers, who would use hydrogen, and they are increasing their demand for hydrogen. So we have the option of putting that into our pipeline. So we have a lot of different options in terms of how we help - we're going to deal with that. Dr. Serhan you want to make additional comments?
Samir Serhan: No, over the year.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. You're okay with this?
Samir Serhan: Yes.
Seifi Ghasemi: So that's where we're with that. Okay?
Josh Spector: Yes. I guess how about the SaaS plant? And just my follow-up, I guess, on Canada would just be are you looking about the returns there as being the three-year post grant number. So the $1.2 billion or $1.6 billion. What are you basically returns off of?
Seifi Ghasemi: The project costs that we have disclosed includes the brand. Correct. That means the net is - that number that we have given you minus the CAD 475 million that we will get from the Canadian government. We have given you the gross number.
Josh Spector: The $1.6 billion minus the $475 million.
Seifi Ghasemi: Exactly. And then with respect to the Sat plant, the Sat plant we are working on that. It is in California - and we are at the mercy of exactly when the permit will get issued. We have the air permit and all of that, but now we are working on getting the actual construction permit so that then we can start working on that project. The dates that we have given you is the best estimate that we have at this time, but that is subject to the issuance of the permit by the state of California or when we can actually start construction. Again, Dr. Serhan, any additional comments on that?
Samir Serhan: The visibility we have, and we expect that by the end of the year, that we will get the construction permits. But again, it really will depend on the officials and the state of California. Okay.
Josh Spector: Yes. Thanks. But just what I was asking on the Canada project was more the basis of what the returns are off. So the 10% pretax return, is that based on the net number or the gross number?
Seifi Ghasemi: It's - Melissa, do you want to answer that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Absolutely. So yes, thank you for the question. So there's two components of the grant. The first component is a capital grant that we are getting from the government. The second component is around a production credit. But for your specific question around where you should expect to take our normal run rate of return, it's associated to the net number, the CAD 1.1 billion that we have listed on the project side.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay.
Josh Spector: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Seifi, just one question…
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: On your blue ammonia facility, a large fertilizer company last night paused their clean ammonia project, basically saying the costs are coming in higher and they're not seeing downstream applications develop as fast as they thought. I was hoping if you could speak to those two factors, cost and offtake agreements as it related to your projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Mike, obviously, I cannot comment on what other people are saying. The blue ammonia project that we are building in Louisiana, there are many different options that we are considering in terms of the exact final scope of that project, as things develop with the markets and all of that. You know very well that, that project, we are going to make 750 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen. One of the issues for us is finalizing how much of that hydrogen we are going to put in our pipeline, and how much of that hydrogen we are going to put and convert to ammonia. That obviously makes a difference in terms of our total capital cost and all of that. I do not want to dispute the general statement that, obviously, the cost of these projects are going to be probably higher than people expected because of inflation, because of labor shortages and all of that. But we have not finalized anything yet, that is at this stage that we would want to talk about that. But, because our scope is still under definition the sequestration, how do we do the sequestration. It will make a difference whether we do the sequestration ourselves or be subcontracted to somebody. So there is a lot of moving parts. But I'd like to turn it over to Dr. Serhan to make some additional comments.
Samir Serhan: Thanks, Seifi. I mean, definitely in the context of the soft global economy, global COVID pandemic, shortages in labor materials, supply chain disruptions, record inflation rate, I think we definitely at the bar sure that we can deliver. I mean, we show that on Jazan, we showed it on Jiutai. We showed that on Gulf Coast ammonia and projects that you don't really hear too many about 160 of them were closed and bought on stream during the COVID period. So I think, again, we managed to show that we are walking the talk basically and we delivered on these things. With the challenges that exist, we do see something like the inflation subsiding slowing down. But it's not going any - but we're really having the execution, basically where managing these challenges and deliver on our commitment, which is the 10% EBITDA during the contractual life of these assets.
Seifi Ghasemi: I'd just like to make one additional comment. I can't help, but make the comment. As I said, I don't want to comment on what others are saying. But I do like to make a general comment that a lot of people sometimes start on this journey of blue ammonia and green ammonia, based on back of the envelope things without really understanding what they're talking about, because they have never done it before. As a result, they come up with numbers that looks pretty attractive. Then when they start actually doing the project, defining their scope and finding out the complexities, then they get surprised. So, I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, many of the people who have embarked on this energy transition would come up with realization, that some of these projects that are a lot more complex than they think. It takes a lot more. And not everybody who has never made a pound of hydrogen in their life can become a supplier of blue or green hydrogen and participate in the energy transition. We have been in this business for 60 years. We think we know what we are talking about. But anyway, I just couldn't help, but make that general comment. Okay.
Mike Leithead: Fair enough. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Seifi, maybe if you could, you've seen quite a few business cycles - so I'd be interested if you'd pontificate a little bit how you see Europe and China, in particular, playing out kind of the rest of this year into next year from a macro standpoint?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you for the question, and I really appreciate the fact that you use the adjective pontificate, because that is what I continue to be doing, because - it's very difficult to see the future. But right now, the way that we are seeing right now, things developing in China and in Europe. China, we have seen some slowdown. It is not affecting our business in a significant - in a material way, but it is affecting our business. But the future is very much dependent on what the Chinese government decides to do in terms of any kind of a stimulus or not. That is very hard to predict. And obviously, we will react to that. The good thing is that a significant part of our business in China, something like 65% of it, is on-site business. So there is a lot of stability there. In terms of Europe, I hate to put it this way, but it really depends on the weather and the energy cost. Because if the weather becomes significantly core and energy costs go up, it will have a significant effect. If they become lucky like they were last year, then the effect will be less and the energy cost will stay low. But overall, it is a little bit of an unpredictable situation. That is why we, as a company, the way we deal with this, is we are very focused on productivity. And as you saw and as you heard Melissa explained, we have taken actions in terms of productivity, and we are taking a charge for that in order to make sure that we are prepared just in case things do not turn out, to be as rosy as some people are predicting. Dr. Serhan and Melissa, any additional color on this?
Samir Serhan: It will be Europe is the one business or one region we have where we have significant amount of merchant, I mean, versus the other regions. So definitely, the industrial out, but not growing in Europe is a concern. I mean we see some signs of picking up, but it's still there. We don't really see it picking up full steam. China, again, we saw some recovery, but it is slowing down. I mean, we're keeping an eye on this and what type of incentives they're going to have there to really incentivize the economy.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So I'll just add one comment specific to Europe. So, we are in a situation where we have now lapped the strong pricing momentum. So that although we are seeing a slight decrease sequentially, we still have very strong pricing in Europe. And so I think we just need to remember that lapping the comps are tougher, but it is still very strong pricing in Europe. So we need to hold on to that, to continue to show the strong returns in Europe.
Duffy Fischer: Great. And maybe - Europe, in kind of switch back to the hydrogen question, obviously, you're talking to a lot of folks there, you have both blue and green hydrogen to offer. How do you see Europe playing out? How much do you think will be mandated kind of at the green level and how much will just care, is it CO2 reduced, so you can use blue hydrogen? How do you see that playing out over the next three, four or five years?
Seifi Ghasemi: Duffy, that is a very good question. Right now, our best information based on discussions with customers, is that Europe is very much committed to green. That they are - that the argument is that blue hydrogen is a transitional thing. So why go through the channel - go to blue and then go to green. You know, we're going to go green, therefore, let's make the leap. And therefore, I'm sure you have seen some of the announcements with respect to, for example, the €2.2 billion that the European Commission approved for Tyson Group, that is clearly was approved for use of green hydrogen. So that is the direction we see in Europe. In Korea, in Japan, I think it will be more oriented at the beginning towards blue because that is going to be used for decarbonizing the power plants. And in the United States, we have to see, but the good news for us is that, we are seeing significant discussion on both, but that it is not as people predicted, that in the U.S. it would all be blue hydrogen. Right now we are talking to companies who are very interested in green hydrogen in the United States, to make their products in the United States, whether it's a seed or chemical.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Samir Serhan: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Duffy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I have one question with two parts. The first is, when I look at your results, your volumes are up 3%, your prices were up 4%. When I look at your competitor in Denbury, I think it's volumes are maybe down 1% and it's prices are up 7%. And in the different regions, it seems like your volumes are growing at a higher rate than theirs and their prices are growing at a higher rate than yours. Can you reflect on that general phenomenon? And then secondly, Air Products claims to dissociate hydrogen at a 10% loss rate rather than 20%, which is sort of the general view that people have because of the energy you need to crack the ammonia. Can you just quickly explain to us in layman's terms how you're able to have a more efficient process.
Seifi Ghasemi: Very good, Jeff. And good morning, to you. Jeff with respect to comparison, you are comparing us to a company which has a different strategy and a different - so I don't want to comment on their results. You are comparing year-to-year because last year, our pricing was significantly better than the other people. So year-to-year, we are not going to show as much as an increase, because if they had a very low performance last year, this year, year-to-year, it looks better. I think that is the main reason for the price increase. And so that is my general comment on that. But overall, we are very much focused on being a green energy growth company. We are an industrial gas company and at the same time. So we are pursuing a totally different strategy, as you know I have talked before. The fact that our volumes are up, and I think this will continue to be the trend that we will beat other people on volume growth is because we are investing in the future, and we are winning our share or even better than our share of the smaller projects than people have been talking about. So as a result, volume growth is obviously the key thing we're focused on. Pricing, we are holding our own. There is no significant difference in the pricing because if it was that the market shares will change. And the market shares are staying stable. So that is the question that I have, first one. On the second question that you have in terms of the efficiency of the crackers that we think we have versus the conventional list that you use 20% to 30% of that. We have talked about this thing. It is a technology we have been developing but the person who is doing that on a day-to-day basis is Dr. Serhan and I like him to make some comments about that. Samir?
Samir Serhan: I mean it really goes safely to what you mentioned before. I mean it's that know-how we developed over the last 60 years in producing hydrogen. I mean this is really what - we had this challenge a few years ago. We looked at the market, we saw that there are ammonia crackers, but the efficiency is really not acceptable. You end up wasting lots of the valuable product. And again, we put our team of expert on this. And basically, we developed a product where we feel is very, very efficient. I mean, to a single-digit loss. And that's really what we have without giving more details. I mean.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Dr. Serhan just gave you more information, but you were saying 10% and he's not talking single digits, which is good news. But Jeff, if I may just summarize, I'm very proud of our team. We do have very good people, and they have developed this technology. And this is going to be a competitive advantage that we will end up having as we go forward on this conversion of ammonia to hydrogen. All okay Jeff?
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Do we have time for one more question? And please go ahead.
Operator: Our last question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Steve Haynes: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. This is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Maybe just a quick one on the fourth quarter guide. I think 4Q usually steps up a bit more seasonally than what you have baked in? I know you just kind of talked about some macro uncertainty in China and in Europe, but is there anything else in there that's causing a little bit of the more muted 4Q ramp? Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for your question. When we give you guidance, we put touch together about what it is that we can see in terms of our best judgment of what we think we can deliver. When you look at our fourth quarter, I do agree with you that compared to seasonally adjusted results in the previous years, it seems that there is not as much of a jump as you would expect. So on that front, maybe you can tell us that we are being a little bit cautious, but we are being cautious because we are totally uncertain about some of the economies. But that is our best judgment at this time. And obviously, I certainly hope that we can do better than that. Okay?
Steve Haynes: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much. That concludes our session. And I would like to again thank everyone for joining our call today. We really appreciate your interest and your good questions. And we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Stay safe. Have a great summer and talk to you soon. Take care. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-05-09 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar. Please go ahead.
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' second quarter 2023 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, including those about earnings, capital expenditure guidance, business outlook and investment opportunities. Please refer to the cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements that is provided in our earnings release and on Slide number 2. Additionally, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures, including earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE, both on a total company and segment basis. Unless we specifically state otherwise, statements regarding these measures are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I am proud to say that our people delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter, continuing to grow our business in a challenging environment. Our team also continued to make great progress in executing our growth strategy, which is focused on the production of low-carbon and zero carbon hydrogen. I would like to thank each one of our talented, dedicated and motivated employees at Air Products for their commitment and hard work. Now please turn to Slide #3, our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. As you can see, we have made significant progress since 2014, but we are always working hard to do better. I want to make it clear that our goal is to achieve zero incidents and zero accidents. Slide #4, which we have shown you many, many times before, summarizes our management philosophy which is critical to Air Products' success and will continue to guide our actions as we move forward. Now please turn to Slide #5. Our second quarter adjusted earnings of $2.74 per share improved $0.40 or 17% versus last year despite the lingering economic headwinds in many parts of the world and exceeded the top line of our guidance for the quarter. We have consistently delivered earnings and top line growth driven by both price and volume, which were collectively up 14% for the quarter versus quarter of last year. We also brought new projects on-stream that further enhance our earnings. Our roughly $16 billion of backlog with more than $11 billion focused on energy transition will continue to drive long-term earnings growth. Now please turn to Slide #6. As mentioned last quarter, we have again raised our quarterly dividend this year, up 8% to $1.75 per share per quarter, extending our record of more than 40 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to pay out more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in 2023, demonstrating our commitment to return cash to shareholders. Now please turn to Slide #7, which shows our EBITDA margin trend. This continues to be my favorite slide as it shows our business performance over time. We were happy to see our margins improve over the past two quarters after the decline which was caused largely due to the dilutive effect of higher energy cost pass-through that increases our sales but doesn't increase our bottom line. We expect our margin to move higher as energy costs decrease while we continue to improve productivity in our base business and add new projects. Now please turn to Slide #8, where I would like to share a few thoughts on our hydrogen strategy. We knew being a first mover in real mega projects has its challenges and that novel ideas and approaches are sometimes met with skepticism initially. When we launched the NEOM green hydrogen project three years ago, we were the first hydrogen producer to capitalize on the ideal renewable energy resources in the Middle East and the first to recognize ammonia's potential as an effective transport medium for hydrogen. When we announced the Louisiana blue hydrogen project in 2021, we were again first mover to act on carbon capture and sequestration on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Now the promise of clean energy is a reality. These projects have gained significant government support around the world, and many companies have since followed our lead and want to become a hydrogen company, announcing large clean hydrogen projects and exploring ammonia dissociation innovation. We believe these developments are actually good for the industry because a successful energy transition will require the work of many different companies, organizations and governments around the world. However, as a global leading hydrogen producer, we are confident that our experience, know-how and proprietary assets will continue to capture the first mover advantage and support Air Products' success in leading clean energy and clean hydrogen development for the decades to come. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, our business performed very well this quarter despite significant macroeconomic headwinds. Price and volume gained 14% and all profit metrics were up double digits versus last year. I, too, would like to thank the Air Products team for their continued outstanding efforts. In March, we were proud to announce the successful issuance of our first-of-its-kind green bond with principal amount of $600 million and €700 million after publishing our green finance framework. With these offerings, Air Products became the first investment-grade U.S. issuer to execute multicurrency green bonds on the same day. Additionally, we are very proud to be the first U.S. chemical company to qualify green and blue hydrogen projects as an eligible expenditure category, which further demonstrates our position as a leader in advancing the world's energy transition. Now please turn to Slide 9 for a review of our second quarter results. In comparison to last year, volumes increased 6% driven primarily by better on-site activities. Volume has been positive for eight consecutive quarters. Merchant price is 18% higher compared to last year, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit increases. This equates to an 8% price gain for the total company, for which we saw positive price gains across all regions. This partially was offset by a 1% lower energy cost pass-through and currency translation from the strong U.S. dollar, which reduced both sales and EBITDA by about 4%. Despite this headwind, EBITDA improved 13%, and EBITDA margin was 140 basis points higher as strong price, volume and the contribution from the second phase of the Jazan project more than offset higher costs. ROCE climbed steadily, reaching 11.7%, which is 140 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on-stream and continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.5% this quarter. Sequentially, volume was up 3% driven by improvement in merchant and our on-site business. EBITDA was up 6%, driven by better volume and equity affiliate results. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our earnings per share results. Our second quarter GAAP earnings of $1.97 per share included two non-GAAP items, which had a combined impact of $0.77 per share. First, we recorded a $0.69 charge for business and asset actions primarily related to our previously announced decision to withdraw from Indonesia coal gasification and permanently suspend the construction of a plant in Ukraine due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding Russia's invasion of the country. Secondly, the non-service components of our defined benefit plans resulted in an $0.08 cost this year versus a $0.04 gain last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items, our second quarter adjusted earnings was $2.74 per share, up $0.40 or 17% compared to last year, driven by strong pricing and higher equity affiliate income. Price, volume and cost together added $0.40. Our price actions more than offset variable cost increases. Price, net of variable costs, contributed over $0.70 this quarter, and volume improvements contributed an additional $0.12. Cost was a headwind of $0.44, but this increase does not represent our new run rate. In addition to inflation and costs related to the execution of our growth strategy, this quarter we saw increased planned maintenance activities, the on-stream project costs and other onetime items we do not expect to repeat. Meanwhile, the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project and good results from our other unconsolidated joint ventures in the Americas and Europe drove equity affiliate income $0.16 higher. Our consolidated joint ventures also performed well this quarter. And we shared the improved results with our partners as shown in the non-controlling interest line. The effective tax rate was 120 basis points unfavorable due to lower tax benefits this year. We still expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% for FY 2023. Now please turn to Slide 11. Our distributable cash flow continued to improve, driven by growing EBITDA and stable cash expenses, including interest, cash tax and maintenance CapEx. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $3.2 billion of distributable cash flow or over $14 per share. From our distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% and $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders while maintaining more than $1.7 billion to invest for growth. Our ability to grow cash flow, especially in challenging conditions, demonstrates the strength and stability of our business, which enables us to continue creating shareholder value by increasing dividends and deploying capital for our high-return projects. Slide 12 provides an update of our capital deployment. Our capital deployment potential through fiscal 2027 remained stable at roughly $35 billion, which includes over $7 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, about $15 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and $13 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity. As always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. We have adjusted our backlog to reflect our recent developments, including the successful completion of our second phase of the Jazan project, the lower equity contribution for NEOM expected from the finalization of the project financing and our withdrawal from coal gasification in Indonesia. Our current backlog of about $16 billion will provide a substantial amount of growth in the future, and we are looking to add additional projects. We have already spent 37% and committed 17% of the updated capacity we show on this slide. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. We continue to evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use the available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Serhan.
Dr. Samir Serhan: Thank you, Melissa. During the second quarter, we saw broad-based improvements across our businesses. Results improved in each of our regional segments versus last year, driven by strong price and volume. Our commercial teams around the world worked hard to make sure that we realize the value of our offerings. And we successfully brought in new projects on-stream to help drive our results. We saw elevated planned maintenance activity due to customer turnarounds in multiple regions, but our volumes again improved this quarter. In addition to energy transition-related investment, we see significant investment opportunities of various project sizes in our base business. We continue to win our fair share of traditional projects across the region and in various industries. Our small- to mid-sized project activities in Asia were particularly robust. We continue to see strength in our small to midsized on-site business globally. Now please turn to Slide 13 for a review of our Americas segment results. Compared to last year, Americas EBITDA was up 14%, supported by higher price and volume. Merchant price improved 21%, the third quarter in a row that we exceeded a 20% increase. On-site volumes were up on a strong hydrogen demand. EBITDA margin of 37% was roughly flat as positive price offset higher costs, largely driven by higher planned maintenance activity, inflation and other onetime items. Sequentially, EBITDA was flat as favorable price and equity affiliate income offset higher costs. Additionally, we also enjoyed successes in larger traditional projects. Yesterday, we announced two new world-scale carbon monoxide projects in Texas with secured long-term off-take contracts from Eastman and LyondellBasell. This project will expand our world's largest carbon monoxide pipeline network in the U.S. Gulf Coast and enhance supplier reliability to our customers. We are committed to our base business while pursuing our growth strategy in low- and zero-carbon hydrogen. Please turn to Slide 14 for a review of our Asia segment results. Our results in Asia improved despite the lingering effect of COVID-19 in certain parts of China and higher energy costs. Compared to last year, EBITDA was up almost 10% despite a 7% negative currency impact. Merchant price improved to 12%, which more than offset higher variable costs. Volume improved 7% driven by [indiscernible] on-site, including the addition of over 13 new assets in the past year, mostly in electronics, glass and chemical application. Sequentially, volume was flat as the new assets offset the seasonal Lunar New Year slowdown. Now please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Europe segment results. For Europe, compared to last year, the story is price. And nearly 20% gain in merchant pricing drove the region's profits and margins significantly higher. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit merchant price gain for the region. Additionally, on-site activities backed up as we saw a recovery in our hydrogen volumes. EBITDA increased more than 30%, while EBITDA margin was more than 750 basis points higher as energy costs continue to come down. Sequentially, EBITDA was higher driven by favorable volume and equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin also improved, driven by the higher volumes and equity affiliate income as well as the lower energy cost pass-through. Now please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Middle East and India segment results. Stronger base volume increased sales but higher maintenance activity negatively impacted operating income. The second phase of Jazan project, which we closed in mid-January, added to our equity affiliate income and it drove EBITDA higher. Both the first and second phases of Jazan project have contributed as we expected, consistent with our commitment. Please turn to Slide 17 for our Corporate and Other segment results. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. The sales and profit for our Corporate and Other segment were lower this quarter, driven by a lower contribution from our sale of equipment business and higher cost as we continue to add resources to support our growth strategy. Customers are very interested in our LNG technology and equipment, and we are pleased to see that our work resulted in four project wins recently. We announced two significant LNG sell of equipment projects and we look forward to making additional announcements in the future. As Seifi and Melissa have already mentioned, the outstanding results of this quarter are a testament of the resilience to our business and the hard work and commitment of our people around the world. I would like now to turn the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing remarks. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #18. Our second quarter results exceeded our previous guidance. However, the outlook for the global economy as a whole remains uncertain. Therefore, we have modestly raised our fiscal year 2023 guidance to $11.30 to $11.50 per share versus $11.20 to $11.50 announced last quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share guidance is $2.85 to $2.95, up 10% to 14% over last year. We still see our CapEx at around $5 billion to $5.5 billion for this year, including the approximately $1 billion that we paid for the second phase of the Jazan project. Now please turn to Slide #19. Air Products was, 80 years ago, the pioneer of the on-site business model, and we were also the first to develop the on-site hydrogen business. Now we are again spearheading the development of large low-carbon intensity hydrogen projects to address the enormous opportunities provided by the energy transition. This drive to lead is part of our culture and shared by our people who have the courage to lead the charge. As I have mentioned many times, the long-term competitive advantage of an enterprise is rooted in the commitment and motivation of its people. This principle has been clearly demonstrated by our past and the leaders into the future. It is our people and their commitment and motivation. Now we are very pleased to answer your questions. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Huang: This is David Huang here for Dave. First, can you talk about the merchant volume trends you're seeing in April and May, maybe by region?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we usually don't comment about the quarter in the middle of the quarter. But in general, I would like to say that we are pleased with the improvement in the economy that we see in China after the Lunar New Year, the Chinese economy gained strength, and we are seeing the benefit of that as you have seen in the last quarter, and we should continue to see that in the next quarter. In Europe, the volumes remain flat and maybe a little bit down. But obviously, we are compensating that with the pricing action related to energy costs. And in the U.S., you know very well, David, it's just flat. They are not gaining significant amount of volumes, the economy is not growing that much, but at the same time, we are not going into a recession, at least we don't see that yet. Is that good enough?
David Huang: Yes. And I guess, second, the projects. Just going back to the Indonesia project cancellation, can you give us the background related to that decision? Is that related to the higher coal prices? Was that a factor in your decision? And then I guess the Jiutai project has been delayed for another two quarters. Can you discuss what's driving that delay?
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. With respect to Indonesia, I mean, coal prices have nothing to do with these things. Coal price is going up and increase the price of the final product. The main reason that we withdraw from Indonesia was that we had started the project about almost five years ago. The project had condition precedents that had to be met and we just were not getting those conditions approved at the different levels. And therefore, at some point in time, you kind of just can't continue waiting for approvals, and we decided that we have opportunities to deploy our cash at other places, and that was the basis of the decision to be drawn. I hope the investors give us the benefit of the fact that we are flexible. We are not -- we react to the circumstances. And we can't keep millions, billions of dollars of Air Products money sitting somewhere for a long time without getting an income for it. And therefore, we decided to deploy the capital at other places around the world, and you will hear about where we are deploying it in the future. The second comment with respect to Jiutai, we have completed the facility on time. But like any on-site business that you're very familiar with, the customer has to give us utilities and provide this raw material for us to get it started. The customer is having some issues with doing that, and that is why we are delaying two quarters.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Regarding the higher hydrogen volumes in the U.S., is that presumably driven by renewable diesel? And just wondering whether those customers would be willing to pay a premium for blue hydrogen to get a lower CI score? And if so, are you reconsidering whether to add carbon capture on your existing methane reformers?
Seifi Ghasemi: Steve, yes, you're absolutely right about the fact that if we can provide the customers that are making renewable diesel hydrogen with a lower carbon intensity, that increases the LCFS credits that they get for selling that renewable diesel in California. Therefore, our customers are asking for blue hydrogen and we are considering converting some of our existing methane reformers, put carbon capture on them and provide blue hydrogen to our customers. In addition to that, as you know, our project -- our big project in Louisiana is all about producing blue hydrogen. So you're absolutely right. Those things will drive demand. We are very excited about that, and it will create a significant opportunity for anybody who can come up with blue hydrogen first and that would be Air Products.
Steve Byrne: And can you provide more granularity on what drove the $0.44 drag in other costs? It seems as if this was primarily in the Americas, it looks to be more than $100 million year-over-year. What is in that? And what is your outlook for it?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, it is really twice what it usually should be. And the main reason for it is that we had some one-time items in the quarter, which throw that. It has to do with incentive compensation. Obviously, if the businesses are doing better, the incentive comp that people will receive will go higher, we have to accrue for that. And there were some other one-time items that drove that cost. We expect that to come down to something more like $0.20, $0.22 that it has been in the past. And that is driven by the fact that we are investing in the future projects and a lot of the cost -- those development costs, we cannot capitalize and therefore, that number will be with us. We have to compensate a bit productivity and other measures.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: So, Seifi, you guys had put out some really cheap green bonds. It looked like it was like 4% to 4.8%, so almost in line with treasuries. I guess when we think about the cost to borrow for green and blue hydrogen projects, is this kind of a reasonable baseline to be thinking about? And does it make you think about potentially putting some of these projects into more of a project finance mode in North America? How should we be thinking about that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, good morning. John, hope all is well. John, you are absolutely making very, very appropriate and correct statements. We were very pleased with the interest rate that we got for the green bonds. It took us only one day to raise the $1.1 billion, which means that there is a lot of demand for that. And it does encourage us to look for project finance on a lot of our projects. And that will increase the firing power that Air Products in terms of doing more and more of these big projects. So we are very happy about that. And obviously, at the end of the day, the interest rate that we pay, that would depend on what the federal reserve does. But right now, as you said, we borrowed almost -- closest to treasuries, which is very good news for us, and we are very happy about that. And you are very right, it will help us significantly in financing the projects in the future and doing more of this .
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. And then the first kind of big blue hydrogen project you have coming up is -- or at least net zero hydrogen project is the Alberta project. I guess can you give us an update on that as to how it's progressing? And also, I know you've got one customer that's taking more than half of the product or projects of product. Can you speak to the demand for the rest of the -- of that blue or net zero hydrogen demand or production and if you've largely allocated the bulk of that?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, that's a very good question. First of all, that project is moving well. We are seeing a significant amount of demand there. We clearly see that we will be sold out of that facility, and we are actually looking at the possibility of expanding that operation to include more. When we announced it, we did say that this is the first phase of a three-phase operation and we expect to do more there. Considering all of the oil industry in that part of the world and the demand for -- obviously, in Canada, it's a little bit different than in the United States. Canada is moving towards the actual carbon tax. A lot of these refineries actually had to do something. And hydrogen is -- blue hydrogen is the solution. We are in a very good position with our pipeline there, with the land we have there. So, we are very optimistic about that, John, very optimistic.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: So obviously, everyone's focusing on some of the aspects of the Indonesia project. But how much of your considerations for the next few years has to do with your increasing ability to bid on blue hydrogen projects and everything that's kind of being brought to the forefront from the U.S. IRA? I mean, from a relative basis, how are you thinking about that capital being used elsewhere for your backlog growth on a go-forward basis, once again, specifically geared towards the U.S.?
Seifi Ghasemi: Chris, thank you for your question because that gives me an opportunity to address it. When we look at projects, I've always said, we look at the specific project, the viability of the project and the profitability of the project. If there is a very, very profitable project that makes sense for us to do in another part of the world, we will look at it and we will do some of those things. But there is no question that the IRA has created a significant opportunity for hydrogen in the United States, especially blue and green hydrogen. Air Products is the leader on that. And therefore, I expect a significant part, a significant part of our investments in the future, will be in the U.S. because definitely we are building a green hydrogen facility in Northern Texas that we've announced. We definitely need to be -- there's another giga green hydrogen project in the United States because of the demand. There are significant opportunities for blue hydrogen in the United States that can be realized because there is possibility of sequestration of the Gulf Coast of the United States. So the -- and natural gas prices are cheap because for blue hydrogen production that we can easily make it and then export it. Therefore, we are very bullish about that. We are very excited about that. And IRA is designed to promote investment in the United States. That is going to happen, and we will be a big participant on that. So I mean, I can't give you exactly the book in the next five years, 80% of our investment will be in the U.S., but it will be a substantial part of it. But at the same time, if there are other interesting projects, as I was telling John McNulty a few minutes ago, with the increased ability to project finance some of these, we will do projects in other parts of the world if they are interesting and lead us to further growth in other parts of the world.
Christopher Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, just on Asia in particular, it seems like things were a little bit more flattish on volume when, I'd say, a lot of us were suspecting that things would improve on a sequential basis. Can you just give your latest and greatest update on how you're thinking about the macro specifically in Asia versus the rest of the world?
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Chris, we have seen significant growth in Asia because of our smaller projects. We did say we have executed about 30 smaller projects. They are not -- they used to be big projects by the old standards, but now we call them smaller projects, $100 million, $200 million, $300 million project. In semiconductors, we have significant additions. In glass, we have significant additions and in other traditional nitrogen generators and all of that. So, we are doing very well. We are gaining more than our fair market share in that part of the world, and we continue to be optimistic about that part of the world in terms of economic growth.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Just wanted to follow up on your intentions to allocate more capital in the U.S. going forward post the IRA. Just curious, if you have a thought or a preference towards the structure of those investments, whether they'll be akin to the big Louisiana mega projects or if they will be more sort of on-site at customer projects or perhaps a mix of both, or if you have any thoughts or preference between those two?
Seifi Ghasemi: Vincent, it's always good to talk to you. It will be a mixture of those things, as you have seen from our announcements, Vincent, the announcement that we put out last night, those are on-site projects at customer sites. The Eastman project is on the side of Eastman and the other one is on the side of LyondellBasell. So, we will do a mixture of both: stand-alone ones where we can feed our pipeline or dedicated ones or a combination of the two of them which has been our model and we will continue doing that. The interesting thing is that this increase in demand for green and blue hydrogen is across the board. It is not that one customer has decided they want to do that. Everybody has to do that. Every refinery in the United States has to decarbonize. Every steel plant has to decarbonize. Every cement plan has to decarbonize. Every glass plant has to decarbonize. Therefore, every heavy transportation has to decarbonize, and the only way to do that is using hydrogen. So that demand will be there, and it will be a mixture of on-site, standalones and all of that. So we will be doing all of the above, as they say.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And as a follow-up, with all of this activity post the IRA, there's obviously more competition for capital to invest in gas projects of all types. So in sort of the more traditional gas projects, sort of non-IRA-driven, are you seeing better project returns available because of the competition for capital? Or has that not happened yet?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think it will happen in time. Your assessment on that is very correct. It will happen in time, yes.
Operator: We'll move to our next question from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: First question on Europe. Can you just speak to the improvement in earnings sequentially? It looks like versus last quarter, volume was up 3%, price was down and EBITDA was up 21%. So can you just talk to the big margin improvement there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, the big margin improvement is driven by the fact that when energy prices were going up significantly, at the beginning we lagged it. As you recall, 1.5 years ago, we had a lot of issues with the investors about erosion of our margin because we couldn't keep up -- increase prices fast enough to keep up with energy prices. So, now we have caught up with that. So, now at the other end of the cycle, energy prices are decreasing and therefore, it gives us an opportunity to increase our margins and make more profit to the bottom line. It's kind of making up for what we lost before.
Mike Leithead: Great. That's helpful. And then second, John asked earlier about your next upcoming net zero hydrogen project, if I could maybe take that one step further and ask about the following project. Could you just update us on the current status of the World Energy SAS facility for 2025?
Seifi Ghasemi: We are working on that project. We have gotten almost -- most of the permits that they need, and we are waiting for one or two of them to start actual construction. Engineering is going on. So that project is moving forward as planned, as of right now. Now we have to look at other opportunities and how we can enhance that project. But the project is moving forward, and the demand for sustainable airline fuel seems to be improving. And other people seem to be very interested in the product, so that they can decarbonize.
Operator: We'll move the next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.
Chris Perrella: It's Chris Perrella on for Josh. I just wanted to follow up on the volume impact from all the customer maintenance in the quarter and potentially how that boost volumes sequentially as those customers begin to operate again.
Seifi Ghasemi: Chris, well, we are hoping to see that. And that is why when you look at sequentially in terms of the earnings share guidance that we have given you, you'll notice that if you do the math, you need to have a pretty decent and robust fourth quarter to meet our guidance of $11.30 to $11.50. So, we do expect that exactly what you said.
Chris Perrella: Right. And then just a follow-up with the European volume, I know that the on-site had picked up in Europe. Just could you give some more color on what you're seeing both in the merchant and the on-site business in Europe?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Our on-site business compared to last year is doing better, and our midstream volumes are kind of flat, nothing significant to report.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: I'll ask just one question here. Where is Air Products on its disassociation technology? And when do you think we'll see the first one of those major projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, excellent question. We have developed the technology in terms of how to crack the ammonia back to hydrogen. And we are going to -- we are in the process of designing and building one of these. And I expect that in about 2 years or 2.5 years, you will have one of these things at commercial scale operating even before we actually have blue or green of ammonia to put into it. We are going to build it and test it with ordinary ammonia. I'm very optimistic about that. We have the technology, it works. So that's competitive advantage that we have over people, John, as we have talked about before.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Maybe a follow-up on the question that John just asked about the dissociation technology. Is that something that you could potentially sell as a sale of equipment for others who are interested in cracking ammonia to get to the hydrogen?
Seifi Ghasemi: Mike, on that one, I think what we will probably do is that if anybody is interested in cracking ammonia, we will suggest to them that we build the plant for them and crack the ammonia back to hydrogen and sell it to them a sale of gas. Even if they have the molecules, the original nitrogen -- the ammonia comes from somebody else. I don't think we will be licensing that at this stage. But I don't want to predict the future. And if there is specific customer who wants huge quantities, we take a look at it. But it is a proprietary technology the same way that we don't license our LNG technology. I don't see us doing that.
Mike Harrison: All right. And then in terms of energy and power costs in Europe, obviously, they've come down quite a bit from where they were over the winter. But what are your expectations as you start to look at the fall and winter for this year? Are you expecting that we could see another increase or spike in energy and power costs there?
Seifi Ghasemi: If I make any comment on that, it would not be that credible because nobody knows how that will move, right? I don't know. I really cannot answer that question because it will be a very difficult thing to pretend to project what is going to happen to energy prices in the future in Europe, right? It depends on the world. It depends on what else will happen. So I just don't want to pretend as if I know something that I don't -- I have no idea, Mike.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Seifi, would you comment on the recent and future trajectory of your backlog? If I look at Slide 12, you show $11.3 billion as the amount remaining to be spent on the backlog. I think that's down about $4 billion sequentially. Presumably, some of that's Indonesia. But as you redeploy that capital, can you comment on how you would expect that number to trend maybe over the next year or so?
Seifi Ghasemi: Go up. It will continue to go up because we are working on a lot of projects, Kevin. And I fully expect that, that backlog will grow because one of the things that is -- one of the things which is not in that backlog is that we have put zero amount for the green hydrogen project that we are doing in Northern Texas. And obviously, we will not put it in our backlog until we get cleared -- get the permits and so on. But that by itself is a significant amount.
Kevin McCarthy: I see. And then secondly, if I may, with regard to your carbon monoxide projects and new contracts that you announced yesterday, I normally think of CO as a co-product of hydrogen. And so will you get additional hydrogen from the new plant in Texas City? And if so, maybe you can speak to what process and what color hydrogen and the fate of those molecules?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that is a very good question. We did put out the announcement because we are obviously transparent and we want you to know what we're doing. But the other end, there's a lot of constraint from the customers about the price and the volumes and all of that. They don't want us to disclose that. But here is actually a very good example of the competitive advantage that Air Products has, is -- you're absolutely right. It can make CO and then by-product is hydrogen. But we do have our pipeline. Our pipeline is sold out. We do need additional hydrogen, and therefore, we will put the hydrogen in our pipeline and sell it. The demand is there. So that was one of the main reasons that we were able to get those projects. And basically on one of them, we displaced an incumbent who has been there for a long time because they didn't have the competitive advantage that we have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with CD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Could you comment on the status of the NEOM project finance? I believe there was supposed to be a dry close shortly after the last earnings call.
Seifi Ghasemi: The dry close has happened. And now, we are basing on what is called the wet close. The dry close is kind of the banks make their commitments. And then the wet close, where we actually receive the money and the commitment, happens usually two, three months after that, after all of the condition, precedents has happened and the lawyers have spent enough time to make a lot of money. So, that is -- that process is underway. So we have had the dry close, and the process is underway in order to get the wet close done. It's going to take some time until we get there. And when we get there, we'll obviously put out a press release immediately and let you know.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. But still on track versus what your prior expectations were?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is correct.
Marc Bianchi: The other question I had is, first, a specific question, but also more broad around IRA, with the specific part relates to how the IRS is looking to handle tracking the carbon intensity of electricity that's going into making electrolysis hydrogen. I think there's some uncertainty as to how that's going to happen. And I'm wondering how that might apply to any of the projects you've got either in backlog or under consideration. I think perhaps, New York might have some exposure to that issue. And then more broadly, I think there's some question as to are there areas of IRA where there's uncertainty with how IRS will handle things. And then Republicans seem to be trying to dismantle IRA, and I'm wondering if that gives any pause to the project opportunities that you're looking at.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, with IRA, you're absolutely right. It's a law. Now it has to be translated into rules in terms of how you apply it. I would just like to make comments. From what I see -- we think that IRA is a good legislation for the world because it promotes decarbonization and addresses global warming. It is focused on hydrogen, which is obviously our business. That was the right thing for them to do. Now in terms of what will happen to it and all of that, I cannot comment on the political situation. But specifically, I would like to say that Air Products position is very clear. First of all, with our project in New York, we are getting power from the Niagara Falls. It is continuous power, 24 hours a day, green. Therefore, we don't see any issue with that. But we have been very public that we believe that you can only make green hydrogen and call it green and not faking it is when you can prove that you are doing that every hour, not average over a year and so on because that doesn't make sense. That is the rule that Europe has adopted. And besides that, anything that you make in the United States has to be a product which is tradable. So we need to follow the lead that Europe has had in terms of the audit production and measuring it on an hourly basis, prove that you are making green rather than saying, well, the sun is shining. I'm making green. But during the night, I'm using the dirty grid to make hydrogen, but we call it green because I made more -- I sold some power during the day to be green. So we have a position on that. We have expressed that position to the government, to the Department of Energy and all of that. So, that, we are very public about where we stand on that. But you are very right. All of these things do need to get translated into law. But I would like to stress that the projects that we announced, they were -- our project in Louisiana and so on, they're all pre-IRA. So IRA will help. But that wasn't the primary reason we did that. The primary reason that we did that is because we think there will be demand for these projects. If IRA doesn't exist, then the price of hydrogen will be higher. If there's -- IRA exists, the price of hydrogen will be lower because you have the incentive and the customer will benefit from someone.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Ghasemi, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, I really do appreciate that. I would like to thank everyone for joining our call today. I know how busy everybody is. We appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter sometime in early August. Please stay safe and healthy, and all the best to everyone. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-02-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today’s call is Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar. Please go ahead.
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Katie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products’ first quarter 2023 earnings results teleconference. This is Sidd Manjeshwar, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Simon Moore, our Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. As previously announced, he will be retiring at the end of March. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2. In addition, throughout today’s discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, operating income, operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our Website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very, very busy schedule to be on our call today. I am proud to say that the people at Air Products delivered great results this quarter despite the significant macroeconomic headwinds. I would like to thank each of our talented, dedicated and motivated employees for their hard work. Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. As you can see, we have made significant progress since 2014. But we always work hard to do better. Our goal is to achieve zero incidents and zero accidents. Now please turn to Slide #4. For the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, our earnings per share was $2.64, an improvement of 0.16 per share or 6% versus last year. But our underlying performance versus last year was much better than that. The items that you need to consider to make a fair comparison versus last year are a $0.15 negative impact from currency, and a one-time gain of $0.20 in the first quarter of last year from the finalization of the Jazan ASU joint venture. I would like to point out also that our guidance for the first quarter was to deliver earnings per share of 2.60 to 2.80. Our actual EPS is $2.64, which is within our guidance but at the lower end. The principal reason is that the Chinese and European economies were weaker than our expectation in early November, [indiscernible] (512) forecast. Now, please turn to Slide #5. We are committed to recording our shareholders, while pursuing our long-term growth strategy. I am pleased to say that we have again raised our quarterly dividend this time by 8% to $1.75 [ph] per share per quarter, or $7 a share on an annual basis, extending our record of more than 14 consecutive years of dividend increase. We expect to pay out more than $1.5 billion to our shareholders in 2023, reflecting our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. Now, please go to Slide #6, [technical difficulty] which shows our EBITDA margin trend. While energy costs remain high, our margin improved this quarter. Our team has worked hard on increasing prices to offset the higher energy costs in our merchant business, and we continue to work on productivity. I would also like to point out that three quarters of the margin declined since the peak margin of around 42% is due to a higher energy cost pass-through in our upside business, which increases our sales but does not impact our profit. Now please turn to Slide #7. In addition to delivering strong results, we also achieved several significant project milestones during the quarter. In December 2022, we were very excited to announce our $4 billion green hydrogen project in the United States. This project will be located in Northern Texas, and is our latest mega-scale zero carbon, which means green hydrogen project since the announcement of our revolutionary NEOM green hydrogen project in 2020. And it will be by far the largest green hydrogen project in the United States. The information about this project and the recording of our December paid net cash is -- for this project are available on our website. Now please turn to Slide #8. We were pleased to announce in January 19, the completion of the second phase of the $12 million Jazan gasification and power project, which is 51% maturity owned by Air Products, and it is 60% project financed. During the first quarter, with the first phase of this project, which was completed in October of 2021, Air Products contributed around $0.5 billion for the purchase of $7.1 billion of assets from Saudi Aramco. In the second phase, which was just completed, Air Products contributed an additional $900 million for the purchase of $4.2 billion of additional assets. Our total cash contribution for this project is $2.5 billion. As expected, the first phase of the project at the end was $0.80 to $0.85 per share on an annual basis, which significantly contributed to our results in fiscal year 2022. With the completion of the second phase, we now expect about a total of $1.35 per share of earning contribution on an annual basis. This is fully in line [technical difficulty] the announced investors more than 3 years ago. Now please turn to Slide #9, [indiscernible] to provide you an update on our great NEOM green hydrogen project, which is appropriate to give you an update, since we are very close to completing a major milestone, which is signing the definitive project financing agreements for this project. And therefore, we wanted to give you an update, before you read about that in the next few weeks. We have been making excellent progress on this large-scale project to bringing green energy to the world. The engineering is now about 30% complete. All major subcontracts for the project have been awarded including [indiscernible] the power plant [technical difficulty]. Land preparation is completed and construction has started. And the joint venture team is in place and executing the project. Now, please turn to Slide #10. As you know, Air Products has a [indiscernible] ownership position of the NEOM production joint ventures. But importantly, and this is very important. We remain the sole offtaker of 100% of the green hydrogen produced in the form of green ammonia produced at this facility and an exclusive 30-year contract. We continue to see significant opportunities to use this [indiscernible] to bring green hydrogen to consumers around the world. And as I said we are the sole offtaker and distributor of this product. Then I want to emphasize that the offtake price for this green ammonia, it remains the same as when we negotiated the original project in the summer of 2020 when we announced the project. This is a very key point than the fact that now we are project financing this project, and as a result, we are absorbing all of the financing charges and so on that has not changed the offtake price. Then, now please turn to Slide #11. Initially the three partners [technical difficulty] which are Air Products, NEOM, which is owned by PIF; and ACWA Power, we intended to use our own cash to fund the project, the total project. Over the past 2 years, we’ve seen significant interest from the global financial institutions who see tremendous value proposition on this project. Therefore, we got tendered [ph] and reconsidered and we decided that the best course of action to minimize our cash contribution and maximize the return on the cash is to do non-recourse project financing of this project. The partners will contribute 25% cash and the remaining 75% will be non-recourse project financing. And obviously, if you are doing non-recourse project financing, you want to maximize the amount of money that you can borrow. Therefore, you put a lot of your ongoing cost and you bring it forward to the real present value and borrow against that. I would explain this a little bit more when we get to the detailed chart. This means that Air Products -- this project financing means that now our cash contribution to this project will be $800 million, less than $800 million, which is significantly less than the $1.7 billion that we originally expected. That is what you would expect us to do, that is the ballpark point of project finance. Now please turn to Slide #12. I’m pleased to say that the non-recourse financing is well underway and we are more than 2x over-subscribed from what we want to borrow. We have received commitments from over 20 global financial institutions, demonstrating their confidence in this project. Later this month, we expect to complete what we call the dry close, which is the signing of the definitive financing agreements, and we expect the full financial close to be completed a few months later. We will obviously let you know as we make progress on the project finance. Now please turn to Slide #13, so that I can provide you with an overview of the total project capital needs. First, the original $5 billion that we have mentioned before, for the capital required to build the facility. We have increased that -- it has increased by about $0.5 billion due to inflationary pressure that everybody expects. Then in addition, we have further increased the investment by $1.2 billion to include [indiscernible] service from other people, but now we want to provide those services ourselves in order to make the project totally self-contained and we wouldn't be dependent on others. These include power transmission lines and other infrastructure that was needed for the project. This increases the capital cost, but it decreases the operating cost and we decided that was a better trade-off. But the key point was to make sure that the project is not dependent on other people doing [technical difficulty] that people have control over the whole thing so that [technical difficulty] we have everything that we need for the project to be operated. Now the other item that I'm sure will be a subject of questions from people is the $1.8 billion for project financing costs. That is a big number, but it is really explaining why that is. Again, as I said, if you have project financing, you want to put and borrow as much money as you can. First of all, about $1 billion of that $1.8 billion is the interest during construction. So we are spending money. We want to borrow that money. There is an interest to that borrowing. Therefore, that adds up for the [indiscernible] of the project to about $1 billion. We want to finance that and borrow against them. Then we are using [technical difficulty] instead of leasing the land for 50 years, we decided to pay for the land upfront that reduces our ongoing cost, and we can finance that. That is a few hundred million dollars. Spares for the project. Usually you buy the spares as you go forward, we decided to buy all the sales upfront and finance it. So those are the kind of costs that comprise the $1.8 billion. It makes a lot of sense, and that is the beauty of finance that you can [technical difficulty]. You have the flexibility of bringing forward a lot of your costs that will save your operating costs in the future. So all together, the total funding needed for the project is $8.5 billion. Now please turn to Slide 14, which is the overview of the funding. As I described before, the $8.5 billion is made up $6.2 billion of non-recourse debt, which we wanted to maximize and $2.3 billion of cash from the three partners. Therefore, obviously, the Air Products cash contributions [technical difficulty], which is less than $800 billion and this is as compared to the $1.7 billion than we originally expected. So overall, we are very pleased with where we are. We are very pleased with the fact that our project financing [indiscernible], minimizing our cash flow, and we are very pleased that the prices that we are paying for the [indiscernible] has stayed the same as it was in 2020. We are very optimistic about projects and the prospects for a good return for the total supply chain as we go forward. Now please turn to Slide 15. I would like to summarize the discussion by sharing some thoughts about our strategy. As I have mentioned before, there are two pillars for growth strategy of Air Products and sustainability is the foundation for both of them. Through our core industrial gas business, the supply customers in dozens of industries with critical products and services that lower emissions and increase efficiency and productivity. Through our Blue and Green hydrogen [technical difficulty] project of the future, we will commit more than $15 billion by 2027 to deliver clean hydrogen at a scale helping to drive the energy transition and moving [indiscernible]. These two pillars, which support Air Products for success put us in the heart of [indiscernible] [Audio Gap] needs for -- the Board's needs for sustainable energy and environmental solutions. I'm proud to say that the people of Air Products have continued to drive results in the near-term and make excellent progress in executing our growth project as we move forward. Slide #16 summarizes our management principles, which I reiterate every quarter. These principles are critical to Air Products' success and will continue to guide us in the future. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Melissa, our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, we've delivered another set of incredible results in the quarter even with significant macroeconomic headwinds. Our commercial teams across the region continue to execute press actions and their efforts paid off. Price droves the 25% operating income improvement despite a significant negative currency impact, and operating margin was also 300 basis points higher compared to last year. I also would like to thank the team at Air Products for their continued outstanding efforts. Now please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our first quarter results. In comparison to last year, sales, volume and price were up nearly 10%. The 7% gain in price for the total company equaled a nearly 20% improvement in merchant price compared to last year, the fifth quarter in a row of double-digit increase. Volumes were up 2% higher, driven by better onsite in merchants, but partially offset by lower sales equipment activities. Volumes were strong in America and Asia, but weaker in Europe. Currency translation from the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced sales by about 6% and lower operating income at 8%. Despite this headwind, operating income jumped 25% and operating margin was 300 basis points higher, primarily driven by strong pricing. Operating income was higher across the region and particularly strong in America and Europe. Improvements in EBITDA and EBITDA margins were not as significant as operating income and operating margins due to the prior year one-time items primarily related to the Jazan ASU joint venture finalization. ROCE has climbed steadily over the last 6 quarters, reaching 11.3%, which is 120 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on stream and continue to put our cash on the balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.3% this quarter. Sequentially, volume was weaker following a strong prior quarter, which also benefited from soft sales and a favorable contract [indiscernible]. Price continues to gain strength across the region. Merchant price improved 3% versus last quarter. EBITDA was down 5%, primarily due to weaker volumes, while EBITDA margin was up 200 basis points as positive price [indiscernible] cost pass-through more than offset the lower volume. Now please turn to Slide 18 for a discussion of our earnings per share results. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.64 per share this year, up $0.60 or 6% compared to last year. Strong price drove the improved results. Price, net of variable costs contributed over $0.70 this quarter as our price actions more than offset the higher variable cost increases. Cost was $0.11 unfavorable primarily due to inflation and higher maintenance. Price, volume and cost together added $0.63 or a 25% increase compared to last year. However, the negative $0.15 from currency and a roughly $0.20 of prior year one-time benefit associated with the finalization of the Jazan ASU joint venture moderates a strong underlying results. The Jazan item accounted for much of the $0.14 decline in equity affiliates' income and an unfavorable $0.10 in non-controlling interest. The effective tax rate of 19.1% was 210 basis points unfavorable due to less tax benefit this year. We expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2023. For the quarter, a non-service component of our defined benefit plans were favorable $0.04 last year and unfavorable $0.07 this year. As I shared with you last quarter, we now exclude the component from our adjusted results. Now please turn to Slide 19. Our distributable cash flow continued to climb, driven by improving EBITDA. While cash expenses included interest, cash tax and maintenance CapEx remains relatively stable over the last 3 years. Over the last 12 months, we generated close to $3.1 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $14 per share. From our distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders while still had an almost $1.7 billion to invest for growth. Our ability to grow distributable cash flow, especially in challenging conditions, demonstrates the strength and stability of our business. It enabled us to continue to create shareholder value by increasing dividend and deploying capital for high return projects. Slide 20 provides an update of our capital deployment. As you can see, we have over $36 billion of capital deployment potential through fiscal 2027. The $36 billion includes over $8 billion of cash, additional debt capacity available today, about $17 billion, we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $12 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity. As always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. So you can see our backlog of nearly $20 billion will provide a substantial amount of growth in the future. However, please note this figure still includes the second phase of Jazan project that was completed in January as well as the capital required for NEOM at its original higher value as we work through the finalization of project financing. Moreover, we will include the $4 billion Texas green hydrogen project when the project reaches final investment decision. We have already spent over 30% and committed 74% of the updated capacity we show on this slide. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high return projects. We believe that investing in these high return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. We continue to evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use available cash and trusted to us by our shareholders. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #21 for our Asia first quarter results. Our businesses were able to deliver positive volume and price despite the negative COVID impact in certain parts of China. Volume improved7% supported by new assets. This quarter, we benefited from more than 25 new small to mid-sized traditional industrial gas plants which came on stream across the region over the last years. Price was up 1% in total, which is 3% -- which translates to 3% in our merchant business. Although underlying sales grew 8% versus last year and energy pass-through was a positive 2%, overall [indiscernible] offset by a 10% weaker currency, which is obviously translation. Negative currency also reduced operating income and EBITDA each by about 10%. Operating income and EBITDA both improved versus prior year as better volume and price more than offset the negative COVID impact. Higher price and volume also drove margin improvement. Although China's government has relaxed its rules related to COVID, the subsequent high infection rates have impacted business activity. We expect economic recovery in China to take time. We anticipate power across the region to continue to rise, and we are taking action, which I mean pricing action, to mitigate the impact. Sequentially results compared unfavorably to last quarter, which benefited from some specific spot sales. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Sidd to discuss our European results. Sidd?
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 22. As the chart shows, power costs for Europe moderated sequentially this quarter, but are still at a historically elevated level. Our commercial team has executed significant price actions to compensate to these costs in our merchant business and their hard work has paid off. Although we have fully recovered the higher power costs for the quarter, we are keeping a close eye on the dynamic power market in this region. As a reminder, power costs in our merchant business is the primary focus when managing the escalating energy costs in Europe. Our on-site business has contractual pass-through, which enables us to pass energy cost to our customers and almost all our national gas usage is for on-site hydrogen production. Now please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our Europe results. Successful price actions, we have worked hard to implement the last few quarters, drove the significant improvement in Europe's results. Compared to prior year, price increased 14% for the regions corresponding to a 24% improvement in merchant pricing. Volume declined6%, reflecting challenging conditions in the region. Demand for our hydrogen was weaker as customers continued to optimize their own hydrogen operations. Our merchant business was lower, partly due to the divestment of our business in Russia. Energy cost pass-through was up 9% due to higher natural gas costs although it had no impact in profit. Operating income jumped nearly 50%, while EBITDA was up almost 30%, primarily due to strong price. Although unfavorable currencies reduced operating income and EBITDA, each by more than 10%. Price primarily drove the more than 400 basis point EBITDA margin increase. This was net of the higher energy cost pass-through, which lowered the margin by about 200 basis points. Compared to the prior quarter, volume was unfavorable due to vehicle merchant this quarter and a favorable contract amendment in the prior quarter. Now I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan, for a discussion of our other segments.
Dr. Samir Serhan: Thank you, Sidd. Now please turn to Slide 24 for a review of our Americas results. Underlying sales increased15% despite the adverse effect of severe weather in December. Price improved for the region by 9%. This is equivalent to a 26% increase in the merchant business. Our team in the Americas has successfully raised the prices to cover the higher energy cost. Volume grew 6% primarily due to better merchant and on-site, volume also benefited from a new short-term agreement, which will benefit Americas results for the next few quarters. Operating income was up to almost 30% over last year. And operating margin improved 300 basis points, driven primarily by the strong price. Volume also contributed to profits, but costs were unfavorable. EBITDA improved less than operating income because of our lower equity affiliate income due to unfavorable one-time items and lower medical oxygen volume in Mexico as the COVID impact subsided. Sequentially, the price continued to gain strength. Merchant price was up 7%, but volume was down 3%, following a strong previous quarter. EBITDA margin improved by around 400 basis points, primarily due to lower energy cost pass-through which accounted for three quarters [indiscernible]. We expect our planned maintenance activity to increase next quarter and parallel with our customers' plan turnaround. Please now turn to Slide 26 for our Corporate segment. This segment includes our -- I'm sorry.
Seifi Ghasemi: Samir you need to [multiple speakers].
Dr. Samir Serhan: I'm sorry, review the Middle East results and India before going to that. So please let's go to Slide 25 first for a review of our Middle East and India segment. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly owned operations are smaller in size. However, the segment's EBITDA is significant, it includes the equity affiliates' income related to the Jazan gasification and power joint venture, our India joint venture, INOX Air Products and other joint ventures. For the quarter, an acquisition benefited sales and operating income versus last year, but was partially offset by land maintenance activities. Although our share of the ongoing Jazan gasification and power joint venture net profit added to the region's results, the equity affiliates' income declined by $28 million primarily due to the one-time benefit associated with the Jazan ASU joint venture finalization in the first quarter of last year. As Seifi mentioned before, we have successfully completed the second phase of the Jazan gasification and power project, and we have begun to receive additional income in the second quarter. Now please turn to Slide 26 for our Corporate segment. This segment includes our sales of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. For our sale of equipment activities, our LNG business historically has been the anchor, but our non-LNG related project activities have also grown in recent years to become major contributors to this segment. The cadence of project activities and timing of sales and profit recognition can vary the segment results. Our ongoing effort to support our growth strategy has also increased the centrally managed functions and corporate costs. For the quarter, the segment sales and profits were lower than last year, primarily due to lower sale of equipment project activities. We also continue to add resources to support our growth strategy. As mentioned before, inquiries for potential LNG projects have picked up recently. However, these projects take time to develop. We're excited, however, that we have signed one new agreement in the quarter and working hard to sign additional new projects. At this point, I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing comments. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide #27. The outlook for the global economy remains uncertain. However, we remain confident in Air Products and the prospects that we have in the future and the stability of our business which is supported by our robust capital deployment strategy as you have seen. Therefore, for fiscal year 2023, we have left our guidance unchanged despite the significant uncertainties that exists in the world. For the second quarter of fiscal year '23, which is usually our weakest quarter. Our earnings per share guidance is $2.50 to $2.70, up 7% to 15% over last year. We still see our CapEx at $5 billion to $5.5 billion for the year, including the approximately $1 billion for the completion of the Jazan project that we just talked about. Now please turn to Slide #28. We include this slide in all our earnings call presentations. It describes very clearly my view that an enterprise can only be successful for the long-term when the people in the enterprise are motivated and committed to emission. At Air Products, our [indiscernible], our mission as a company is to bring people together so that they can collaborate and innovate solutions to the world's most significant energy, environmental and sustainability challenges. We continue to build a diverse and inclusive culture that are more than 21,000 people feel they belong and matter and are motivated to achieve our goals. I believe Air Products is uniquely positioned to help the Board transition to a cleaner and better future, and we are putting our efforts toward that each and every day. Now we are very pleased to answer your questions. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. Seifi, just given all the macro uncertainty that's prevailing across the globe, can you just give us your current assessments of where you think you stand as well as the operating rates for the regional merchant businesses? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Chris. Right now, obviously, it's very difficult under the current circumstances to predict what is going to happen in the next few quarters. But we feel very confident about our own operations and about our ability to keep our plants running and service our customers. And as I look around the world, we obviously saw the Chinese economy a little bit weaker in the first quarter than we expected. Right now, my view on the Chinese economy is -- we have to wait and see how it comes out after the Chinese New Year. We don't expect any kind of disaster or any bad news, but it's just a question of the rate of improvement how would that be? We are very well-positioned there. We have taken action to increase prices and most important, as I said, we are benefiting from the fact that we have 20, 25 smaller projects that we usually don't announce, but they are standard industrial gas projects, they are coming on stream, and they are contributing. So we feel that we will be able to deliver on Asia in general. In Europe, the economy again, was weaker than we expected in the first quarter. But right now, energy prices seem to have a stabilized. Power prices have stabilized, natural gas prices have not yet. But overall, we think that we should be okay in Europe. And in the U.S., you saw our actions in respect to pricing last quarter, we got overall,7% -- overall for the whole company, we've got 7%. But in the U.S., we got almost 14% price increase, which translates to almost 19% -- 20% price increase on the merchant side. Latin America is always very big, so we don't talk about it too much. So overall, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to deliver forecast that we have given you for the year.
Christopher Parkinson: That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, just given now that investors and your team has had an opportunity to digest the IRA. Is there any key opportunity that's, let's say, specific to Air Products that you believe investors are missing? Is there something on the HEICO facility retrofits? Is there just anything else in terms of that materialization over the next several years that we all should be paying attention to? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, Chris. That's a very, very good question. I don't want to comment too much about the IRA benefits because the law is that everybody can read that. But the opportunities for Air Products that we will definitely follow-through is, number one, we did put carbon capture on our existing facilities. There is two benefits on that: Number one, we reduced our CO2 emissions; and number two, that gives us an opportunity to have a lower carbon hydrogen that we can sell at higher prices. We will definitely do that. Then we are benefiting from the IRA [indiscernible] before the IRA, which was the project that we had announced before the IRA, which was the project in Louisiana. We did that project with the economic space, no IRA benefit on $85 for CO2 capture. We've been accounting on about $50. So that additional $35 enhances the returns on that project. And then we will do significant amount of green projects in the United States. We did announce the project in Northern Texas and we definitely are working on other mega projects to produce green hydrogen in the United States. The IRA credits for $3 for green hydrogen production. First, the fact that if you make an integrated facility, you also get credit for the renewable power that you generate makes it very attractive to make these investments in the U.S. We are extremely well-positioned with our pipeline in the Gulf Coast and with our know-how and with our distribution capabilities to do things that other people cannot do because anybody who can already take advantage of the credit if you can do something with the hydrogen. I mean people can run around and say, okay, I'm going to build a plant to produce green electricity and produce hydrogen. But then what do you do with the hydrogen. Air Products is one of the very few companies who knows what to do with the hydrogen, the other hydrogen company. Therefore, we are in a very unique position to take full advantage of the IRA registration. We are very pleased with that. That was a very significant step forward in the United States. And then the very good news for us is that, that has prompted other countries to take action. And I think yesterday or the day before that, you saw an announcement from the European Union that they are going to have a program of about €280 billion to promote the same kind of things which would, obviously, be very good for us because we are a global company.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, Chris. It's very helpful, Seifi. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Good morning. This is Anthony [indiscernible] on for David. Seifi, you mentioned in your slides, your new capital structure and the changes on the capital costs and contributions to NEOM, what is the return on this project versus what you were expecting when you first announced the project in July of 2020?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that I have three partners, and I don't want to speak for them and disclose the return on the project. But the thing that you have to take a look at is that we don't look at the return on the project because we are going to take the offtake and sell that and make money on that, and that is how we take a look at the return on the total investment. So on that front, the return on that is going to be in accordance with what they have given you a guidance, which is for every dollar that we invest, you should expect about $0.10 of operating income. So you have to look at total supply chain from Air Products' point of view. In terms of the specific return on the product, that is up to my partners to decide whether they want to disclose that or not. I don't want to disclose that because for us, that doesn't mean anything. It's the total supply chain. The important thing that you need to focus on is the fact that we are off-taking the ammonia at the same price that it was negotiated in 2020. Okay?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Understood. And as a follow-up on the green ammonia, if you did not lock in this price to purchase, how much higher do you think it would be today versus when the project comes on stream?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it depends on what you would have negotiated with our partners. I don't expect it to have been significantly different. But because -- I mean, you talked about additional capital cost, but as I said, a lot of the operating costs is being capitalized. So that necessarily doesn't affect the return on the project. But again, I just don't -- I have two other partners, and I respect them. I don't want to disclose their financials there. But as I said, [indiscernible] from a product point of view, you need to look at the total supply chain.
Seifi Ghasemi: [Indiscernible], okay.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, Seifi so. Seifi, you seem excited about the price of the offtake for NEOM basically remaining flat. So I guess, why is that? Are you seeing interest from buyers right now that are higher than what you thought they would be at the time that you originally signed into this contract? I guess, how should we be thinking about that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Well, I think that's one way of putting it. The thing that we see is significant interest in the product. And obviously, as a businessman, we would like to offtake anything that we buy at the most favorable price that they can get. But I'm particularly interested in the reason I keep mentioning that because I just want to make sure that people don't think that, well, these guys said $5 billion, now it's $8.5 billion. Therefore, this -- the price of ammonia must have gone up. It did not. And it just -- look one other thing, John, you know this better than I do see our project financing this thing with some of the biggest banks in the world, giving us money. They have looked at this project, they have looked at [indiscernible] of the, and they are bidding to finance it. So I guess, they all think this is a good project and a good prospect, and they were going to get their money back. You know what I mean?
Dr. Samir Serhan: Yes. No, for sure. I guess, maybe looking at it from a slightly different angle. So when you think about like when I think about project financing, the benefit of it is that tend to juice the returns a little bit more, but it does take out some of the EPS on the -- tied to the equity that's being put to work because there's less equity involved. I guess when you think about the total capital of the project overall, the distribution side as well as the actual production side and the economics around that. I guess, how has that changed relative to what you thought originally with the project financing now in place?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, it has obviously improved because I'm putting less cash on the production side. So we are bit off. And as long as the price of ammonia is the same. So we have made an improvement. We have another $1 billion that we were going to invest to do other things.
Melissa Schaeffer: Got it. Fair enough. Thanks very much, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to John Roberts with Credit Suisse and thank you. ExxonMobil recently announced a blue hydrogen project in the Gulf Coast that includes ammonia as well. And it looks like it has merchant ambitions there? Since refiners are a large customer for Air Products, help us understand, would you have bid for that project as well? Or how do we think about how your customers might play in the hydrogen and potentially ammonia market?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I mean, I can't comment on their strategy of Exxon and what they're going to do. But this is a competitive Board. If Exxon decides that they want to get into their merchant ammonia business and make blue ammonia to sell, then we will have an extra -- an additional competitor. Hydrogen that they are going to produce a significant amount of that from what I understand is going to be used to replace the natural gas that they are using because the whole purpose of the project is to reduce their carbon emissions. So if they do that, now are they going to make so much hydrogen have extra amount to do merchant. I don't know, I don't have any visibility on that and all of that. That to them to do what they want to do. We would have [technical difficulty] you know what we are doing and as I said, I'm sure other people will get attracted to these projects. But it's one thing talking about these things is actually doing the details they just announced they're doing a fee. They have to wait until they do the fee, then they add their costs and then they find out what the total cost is and all of that. But it's a target up to them. They decided to do it themselves, which is fine.
Ezekiel Roberts: Okay. And then since the Alberta blue hydrogen plant will be the first really big project up online, do you think you'll get a premium on all of the hydrogen out of that plant? Or do you think some of the hydrogen is going to be sold with the existing gray hydrogen market.
Ezekiel Roberts: What the interesting thing is that you mentioned [indiscernible] our project in Canada, the customer for that project is Exxon. We are, right now, almost sold out of that project, and they are getting a significant premium, yes, because Exxon through their subsidiary, which we have announced this publicly, so I'm not putting anything new to their ancillary, which is the inferior Chemical Limited, they are going to use the blue hydrogen we give them to produce renewable diesel that they're going to sell in California at premium prices. And as a result, they are giving us a significant premium for the blue hydrogen that they are buying from us in Canada.
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. You had some pretty hefty merchant price increases in Europe and Americas. My question for you is how much of that had a surcharge in it given gas costs have dropped in both regions. Could you see some sequential decline in pricing in those regions?
Melissa Schaeffer: What the question that you're asking, Steve, is very relevant. We obviously have increased the prices in order to recover the power cost. Obviously, at some point in time, if the power costs go down, then some of the customers would expect us to decrease those prices. And we listen to that and we will make a decision based on supply-demand situation as we always do. So it is possible. But if the price declines in the future, then that would be as a result of power price declining, therefore, theoretically, there shouldn't be an impact on our bottom run.
Steve Byrne: Okay. And just a follow-up on NEOM. Has the design of it changed, is it still a couple of gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity or has this changed? Could you produce more than the 1.2 million tons of ammonia. It seems like you could battery backup. Is that also enabling you to lead -- to have an unchanged ammonia price from this project?
Dr. Samir Serhan: Steve, you're asking a very good question, which is subjective in general discussion cloud event. We are -- this is the first significant project that we are doing for green. We are obviously installing a significant amount of wind and solar capacity and we are installing a significant amount of electrolyzer capacity. What these electrolyzers and wind and the solar we do actually might end up giving us the capability of making a lot more than the $1.2billion. But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I don't want to promise that, but you are on the right track that there might be an upside in that side. And I personally understand there could be an upside, but we have to wait and see. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question is on the -- on the new $8.5 billion kind of oven CapEx number. Can you just give us some comfort of framework around how walked in, that number is obviously, there is still about 70% or so, the engineering works left. Just any comfort around now what you’re doing to make sure that number is not going to move again, say, in the next three years. 
Seifi Ghasemi: At this point I can say that we had an off contingency there. And we have done enough work that I think that’s a pretty good number. But nothing just 100%, but I feel pretty good about that number at this stage.
Mike Leithead: Got it. Makes sense. And then …
Seifi Ghasemi: [Indiscernible] underlying, who is in charge of our -- all of our engineering and all of that. But I think [indiscernible] pretty comfortable that, that is a good number. We spend a lot of time making sure that when we are doing project financing that we don't have to go back for additional financing, but we feel pretty good about the number at this stage. Besides the engineering, we haven't add the page made the major orders on the project. So basically, that's also much then for like and even for construction for the green element that's also being replaced.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Yes. And just as a quick follow-on with the new capital structure, that obviously can sometimes come with some level of covenants or restrictions around distribution. So just how should we think about the cash dividends from the project? Should they generally match income? Or are there some constraints or restrictions around the cash you can get back to their products.
Seifi Ghasemi: For the cash income from the project itself, obviously the project will have a cash flow that we'll go to servicing the debt and if there is any extra of that, which I hope there is, that will come back to the shareholders. That's the major structure [ph].
Mike Leithead: Got you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. With regard to Asia, you had healthy volume growth of 7%. But in the prepared remarks, I think you made a comment that you started 25 new assets in the region over the past year, which sounds like a fairly large number. So I was hoping you might be able to put that into context for us. Looking ahead, would you expect the contributions from those startups to remain elevated or regressed by some amount? How would you describe the shape of that profile in Asia?
Seifi Ghasemi: Kevin, quite honestly, that's a very good question, [indiscernible], good morning. Should -- I did think this is a good opportunity for me to make a comment. At other times, people think that at Air Products, the only thing we do is make our project. We have our base business, and we are making good progress in our base business. We are getting our share of all of these small products. We don't announce it every time we have a $50 million nitrogen generator, but these things do add up. We had about 25 of them [indiscernible] on the stream in Asia. What they are doing is that they are helping us to deliver the volume increases despite the fact that you know that economic activity in China was almost -- it has gone from 6%, 7% back to about 2%, 3%. So we are getting the benefit of that. And these things will help us in the future to make up for any weakness and therefore, continue to help us to deliver good results for that region despite the fact that China might be flat or slowing down. So these are the good things. They are going to contribute, and we are very excited about it.
Kevin McCarthy: Hey, thank you for that. And then secondly, if I may, in North America, you made a comment that volume benefited from a new short-term agreement. Can you elaborate on that? What impact did that have? And how long might it persist?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I don't want to disclose the name of the customer and so on, but we did get an opportunity because we could serve customers that other people couldn't serve, so we did get that benefit. But I would like to turn it over to Melissa to expand on that, Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So thank you. So from a volume perspective in the Americas, that agreement was about 3% of the increase in the volume. Now we will see that over the next four quarters, be pretty consistent. So that's what we would see attributed to 2023.
Kevin McCarthy: That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In the NEOM ammonia production project, did the net present value of your one-third ownership stake, in your mind change that is you had a net present value assessment? Is it different now? Or is it the same or lower or higher?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Jeff. We're saying that we had a net present value which was the discounting of all of the cash flows that we expect in the few years and now with the project financing is that higher or lower, I think it should be about the same or even better because we are doing project financing, Jeff.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Right. Because you're using more capital or the whole -- there's more capital that's going in. The second question is, have you determined how much ammonia you're going to make in your Louisiana project? And does that project -- is it necessary for there to be a substantial amount of ammonia for that project to go-forward.
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, that's a very good question. We have disclosed publicly that, that project will produce about 1,850 ton a day approximately of partnership. That project is literally next to our pipeline. So we are assessing how much of that we can put to the pipeline and sell because 1,850 tons of hydrogen is not that huge compared to the total sale of hydrogen that we have on our pipeline because our pipeline over there can do significantly more than that, significantly more than that. Therefore, one scenario is that all of the customers on the pipeline due to environmental regulations or the registration develops and so on decide hey I want blue hydrogen. Then we can just [indiscernible] out of the hydrogen into the pipeline. Then it is possible that not all of them would convert. Some of them would say, no, I was still okay, with gray hydrogen. Then we did have excess hydrogen to put and make it into ammonia. Therefore, what we are doing is that in terms of the actual building of the plant, we are building the plant to have ammonia facility that means you can build the ammonia plants. And then we will have ultimate capacity to an ultimate flexibility to use as much of the hydrogen in the pipeline and whatever we can use, we make into ammonia. There are ammonia plants themselves, Jeff, in the context of the overall. Don't cause that much. The ammonia plant, once you have the infrastructure, putting a 1.2 million ton ammonia plant by itself is only $250 million. So we are not going to lose anything significant by having basically cycle spare capacity. And then the other thing is, obviously, how the demand for blue ammonia developed as we go forward in the next few years. So we are building a plan to give us the flexibility, and this is the beauty of the situation that Air Products has that nobody else has. Is that we can make through hydrogen, and we have total flexibility, but that we can send it as hydrogen or we can sell it as ammonia. Because of the unique situation because we have the pipeline. And as a result of that, I think we can maximize the profitability of that better than anybody else then possibly can.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: So you haven't determined how much ammonia you're going to make yet? 
Dr. Samir Serhan: Yes, I said we haven't determined how much ammonia we're going to sell.
Melissa Schaeffer: [Indiscernible] how many ammonia plants you're going to build?
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Great. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Thank you very much, Jeff.
Operator: We will take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citi.
PJ Juvekar: Yes, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, PJ. How are you?
PJ Juvekar: Good. Seifi, on the NEOM project, you had inflation and then you also had that $1.2 billion of increased sort of financing costs, et cetera. What is that -- and that is -- not the financing cost I'm sorry, there's the additional cost --additional scope, I should say, and you're going to build transmission lines yourself, et cetera. What does that mean? Does that additional scope mean that the project could get delayed? Or do you think it's still on time for 2027?
Melissa Schaeffer: [Indiscernible] on time for 2027. The additional scope is something that we have been thinking and planning on it and then -- the progress on this project is that at the beginning, you go over there and you say, okay, I'm going to build the plant. All of the infrastructure is already there or it's going to be there, and therefore, we can draw on that. As the project goes forward, you will start getting a little bit concerned about the ability of other people to build teams that you need. Therefore, with the project finance, we decided that we are going to do all of that that increases the capital, but it saves us operating costs, as I mentioned before.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you. And there was earlier discussion about hydrogen price. The IRA gives $3 per kilogram benefit to green hydrogen. But how much of that you think you and the industry will have to pass it on to customers, so they get lower hydrogen price. And I think that's the ultimate goal of the government is to lower the hydrogen price. So do you have any thoughts on how the industry or the hydrogen price evolves over time?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. P.J. Obviously, that will be the case because if you are building a plant and we are going to get $3 for the green hydrogen. And as I said, that $3 is actually more because if you build an integrated facility once we are doing, that means that the wind and the solar is part of the project. You also get a benefit for the wind and solar. So the total I think translated to per kilogram of hydrogen is more than $3. So we obviously -- when we do projects, we expect that we turn if you are getting the subsidy that improves the returns. So we will pass-through some of that to the customer and we will achieve the goal of the government, which is the goal fundamentally the price of hydrogen so that people can convert. That is exactly the goal, and that is exactly what we have P.J.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you very much. 
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: We will take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning. So on Slide 30, you talk about downstream hydrogen supply chain is about $2 billion between 25 to 28. Is that $2 billion a number that could go up as new projects or you look for new opportunities in the supply chain? And any thoughts in terms of the timing between 25 and 28 ?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that was our estimate before about the $2 billion. But that number could be best, could be more, and let me just explain. It depends on the customers, it is possible that you can have -- because when you look at the customers, there are some customers that are like the mobility where you need a lot of infrastructure to serve it. You have to bring the hydrogen to a port, have an ammonia tank, crack it, liquefied have the trucks to go and deliver to the gas stations and sell it today. That is one way of selling the hydrogen. Another way is that somebody develops ships that can use ammonia and they've on green ammonia. And in that case, there is no infrastructure because the ship can dock in NEOM, put ammonia in it and then use it as fuel then there is no infraction cost. Another customer could be somebody that you bring the ammonia to a port, you crack it and then you put it in a pipeline and that goes into a chemical plant or some other kind of a plant, and they use all of that, then you don't have to liquefy, you don't have to build the infrastructure for trucks and so on. So because of that infrastructure is very much dependent on the exact kind of customers. Right now, our best estimate is that with the $2 billion, we will be able to build an office infrastructure to use the capacity of new. But that could be significantly less or it could be more depending on exact infrastructure. But if it is more than that means that the infrastructure needed for the trucking is obviously more expensive, which means that the price of hydrogen at the fund is a lot higher than the price of selling if we didn't have to be qualified. So it will all adjust for itself. Is that okay?
Mike Sison: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Steven Haynes: Hi. This is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a quick one on the other cost line and your EPS bridge, it was about $0.11 of headwind in the quarter. How should we kind of be thinking about that going forward? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the other costs, I'd like to have Melissa comment on that, Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes, absolutely. So the other cost line, we had a number of components this quarter play into there. We had a sizable maintenance, both in the Americas as well as north India joint venture or India segment. So that added additional costs this quarter. We should see that go down in the next quarter. Fixed cost inflation, however, is a driver and at 11%, and that will be consistent throughout this fiscal year.
Steven Haynes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the near-term, when I look at your next quarter guidance, and close based on your math, maybe to add $0.12 or so sequentially. I was thinking there's maybe some merchant benefit as energy prices come down, maybe those volumes down a little bit, but December quarter wasn't super strong from a demand perspective. So I guess why wouldn't earnings be up sequentially given some of the tailwinds? What am I missing?
Seifi Ghasemi: I don't think you're missing anything. Your logic is very correct. The only thing is that when we make guidance, we have to kind of be cautious to make sure that we deliver it. The part that we are very concerned about, and we don't have any visibility is what is going to happen in the Chinese and European economy. I don't know how the Chinese economy is going to come out of the New Year holiday. And we don't have much visibility currency and how energy prices are going to develop in Europe. That is why we are a little bit cautious, and you are very correct to kind of say, maybe you're being conservative, maybe you are, but we just wanted to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves.
Josh Spector: [Indiscernible], appreciate that.
Josh Spector: Sure, absolutely. Thank you.
Josh Spector: Sorry, if you had more go ahead, but I was going to ask a second quickly, the Canada project financing, was that expected that anticipated in your economics? Does that change your cash [indiscernible]? I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So thank you for asking that. So just to be clear, on our Alberta project, we have no project financing associated to that project.
Seifi Ghasemi: Exactly. On the project financing, we do the [indiscernible] project by project. [Indiscernible] because it's a very complicated project and so on, difficult to finance. NEOM was pretty easy because there's an offtake price and so on, and we can calculate that. Now with our project in [indiscernible], the $4 billion project that we announced, we will most probably look at project finance on that. But we made the decision a step by step, the options that Air Products has, which is [indiscernible] is that we have the option of using our own cash because we have the cash. We have the option of raising money by going to the market as Air Products and raising bonds and then they have the option of project finance. So we take everything into consideration and come up with the best possible solution. So with new, with the partners and so on, we decided project finance was the best thing. Obviously, for project finance, we are going to pay a higher interest than if we have gone and increased bonds, but that was a joint decision with other partners. Now for the project in Texas, we will probably do project finance. For the project in Louisiana, we probably would. It depends -- and this is something that keeps our finance department and our treasury department busy trying to assess all of these things, and we do ask all of those questions. and we make the most optimum decision.
Josh Spector: Okay, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Any more questions, operator?
Operator: We will take our next question from Laurent Favre with BNP.
Laurent Favre: Okay. [technical difficulty]. Okay. Hello. Good morning, all. My question is on inflation or the inflation risk for the rest of the backlog. So if we take one from the $19.4 billion, there's about $15 billion less. I was wondering if you could talk about the risk that there. We also see billion or $1.5 billion of extra costs and whether you have flexibility on selling prices to adjust for that to maintain returns? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you. The rest of our projects, obviously, some of them are the other projects that we have announced are actually in a much more advanced stage than new. So we have a pretty good feel for their cost and all of that. But I don't want to deny decide that there is inflation. But we just don't think that the inflation thing is something that we cannot manage or it will significantly caused a struggle because with some of the projects, I mean, let's take the project in Louisiana. The project in Louisiana, if there is inflation on our capital cost goes up, then they will price the ammonia and the hydrogen out of that facility accordingly. So there is not a type of project that we have committed to a sales price for the product and now we have to keep the additional projects.[indiscernible], but most of those things are just about that. So that's why the thing we can manage.
Laurent Favre: Okay, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our final question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. Just given a forecast that we'll be likely entering a recession. I just wanted to get a sense of how merchant volumes and pricing fared during the last recession. If you can give [indiscernible] overview of that, I would appreciate it. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: That’s a fantastic question. Good question. The quick thing is I can answer that very definitely because you have seen our results during the last -- the last recession obviously was in 2008, 2009 and the second one was during COVID. And you saw what we have always said that Industrial gases business, we have another resulting industry because half of our business is on top. That doesn't get really affected by recession because they are [indiscernible]. And our picture volumes usually go down, but they do not go down significantly. We take action to control our costs, and therefore, you can take a look at our actual results during 2009 and 2010 and 2008 over results in 2020 and2021, and you'll see that we held up pretty well.
Laurence Alexander: Okay. Thank you.
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you very much and [indiscernible], I would like to joint everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. As I said earlier, please stay safe and healthy and all the best to all of you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-11-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Air Products’ Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today’s call is Mr. Simon Moore.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products’ fourth quarter 2022 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Sidd Manjeshwar, our Vice President and Corporate Treasurer. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two. In addition, throughout today’s discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. I am extremely proud to say that Air Products with grit and determination has again made great progress this year despite macroeconomic headwinds. We exceeded our financial goals, had great results, and at the same time, reached many key milestones that significantly advanced our growth strategy. I would like to thank each one of our talented, dedicated and motivated employees at Air Products for their exceptional efforts. I am proud to be working alongside them as they continue to deliver strong near-term results, as well as executing our long-term strategy. Before I discuss our results, I would like to share some good news. In his opening comments, Simon mentioned that Mr. Sidd Manjeshwar is joining us on our call today. In addition to Sidd’s existing responsibilities as our Corporate Treasurer, he will also be taking on the additional responsibility for leading our Investor Relations team. As we shared last quarter, Simon is planning to retire at the end of March 2023. For the next few months, Simon and Sidd will be working closely together to ensure a smooth transition. Sidd brings a breadth of knowledge and expertise across finance disciplines, and since joining Air Products in April of 2021, he has played a key role in supporting our financial policies and strategies. I know he will be an exceptional and excellent resource for our investors and analysts as we continue to communicate and execute our growth strategy. Sidd, congratulations from all of us and would you like to say something at this stage?
Sidd Manjeshwar: Thank you, Seifi. I appreciate your kind words and I am humbled and honored to be part of this tremendous team, and to be taking on these additional responsibilities. I am very much looking forward to meeting with our analysts and investors, and continue to create work Simon has done to engage them and share our exciting growth strategy. Thank you once again and I look forward to connecting with everyone.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Sidd. And now please turn to slide number three. Before I will discuss our results, I would like to highlight our safety performance, which is always our highest priority. We continue to make progress, but we can always do more to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees. Our ultimate goal is a zero incidents and accidents. Now please turn to slide number four. For fiscal year 2022, our business delivered strong earnings per share of $10.41, an increase of 15% compared to last year. Price and volume both improved across the regions and the Jazan project contributed as expected. Our team delivered these impressive results despite a $0.24 per share headwind from currency and challenging macroeconomic environment. These results for sure confirm the resilience of our business portfolio and the absolute commitment of our people to deliver near-term results. Now please turn to slide number five. These excellent results confirm once again that Air Products has the capacity to deliver near-term performance, while executing our ambitious long-term growth strategy. On slide number six, you see that since 2014, our goal has been to deliver an average EPS growth of 10% per year. In the last eight years, we have exceeded this goal and delivered 11% for this time period. As you can see on slide number seven, we have consistently delivered positive earnings growth since 2014 regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. Our on-site business with its take-or-pay contracts gives us downside protection and our merchant business having volume and price flexibility, can provide upside potential. In addition, our backlog of nearly $20 billion will add significant long-term growth in the future. Now I am on slide number eight. For fiscal year 2023, our guidance is to continue this trend and deliver adjusted earnings per share of $11.20 to $11.50. I would discuss our guideline in more detail later in the call. Now please turn to slide number nine. The strength and the stability of our business provide a secure steady cash flow and we are committed to reward our shareholders by paying a healthy dividend. The whole team is very proud that we have provided 40 consecutive years of dividend increase to our shareholders. This extraordinary achievement is a testament to our people and their strength and stability of our business. On slide number 10, you can see that our dividend has grown 10% per year on the average in the past eight years mirroring our earnings growth. We expect to return more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders in calendar 2022 and still have significant cash flow to support our growth opportunities. I would like to point out that on slide number 11, which is still my favorite slide, about three quarters of the decline since the peak margin was due to higher energy cost pass-through, which increases our sales, but does not impact profit. On slide number 12, you can see a summary of our management principles, which I have shown to you every quarter in the past eight years. These principles have guided and will continue to guide our performance as we go forward and we intend to follow these policies consistently as we go forward. Now please turn to slide 13 for a brief overview of our latest green hydrogen project that we announced recently. We took another significant step forward toward a clean hydrogen future by announcing our investment of about $500 million in a new green hydrogen project in Massena, New York, located on the banks on the St. Lawrence River. The facility will produce about 35 metric tons of green liquid hydrogen using almost 100 megawatts of hydroelectric power provided by the New York Power Authority. We are excited about this project since it broadens our renewable energy sources to include hydro power in addition to solar and green energy. It also demonstrates the growing support for the energy transition in the United States, which has been further reinforced with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. We are actively pursuing other project opportunities for green hydrogen in the United States, driven by this world-leading legislation. I look forward to sharing more information about these projects as we go forward. Now please turn to slide number 14. As you know, we announced our sustainable aviation fuel project with World Energy in April. This project is another great example of the investment opportunities that further support -- that is further supported by the Investment Reduction Act legislation. We are -- as a result of that legislation and the incentives put for sustainable fuel aviation, we are expanding our scope and now we will investment -- we will increase our investment from $2 billion to $2.5 billion in this project. We still expect that this project will contribute more than the minimum returns that we have promised you before. Projects like these are aligned with our energy transition strategy and will continue to drive our earnings now and well into the future. Now, with that, I would like to turn the call to Melissa Schaeffer, our CFO. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned, our business performance performed very well despite the macroeconomic challenges this fiscal year. Our on-site business, which generates about half of our total company sales, once again held firm, while our merchant team successfully managed through the significant energy cost increases. Our people worked hard to overcome supply chain challenges across the regions, key care facilities running and our customers supplied. I would like to thank the entire Air Products team for their hard work and a job well done. Now please turn to slide 12 for an overview of our full year results. Underlying sales were strong, up 14%, with significant contributions for both price and volume. Overall, price increased 6%, which corresponds to a 15% increase in our merchant business. Year-over-year price improved every quarter in our last -- in our three largest regional segments and across most of our major product lines. Our volume grew 8%, driven by improved hydrogen, new plants, merchant demand and increased sales of equipment activity. EBITDA was up 9% due to favorable price, volume and equity affiliate income, which are partially offset by a higher cost and unfavorable currency. EBITDA margin was down just over 400 basis points and was negatively impacted by over 400 basis points by energy cost pass-through, which drove approximately half the total sales increase, but added no profit. The impact of the energy cost pass-through was particularly noticeable in the Americas and Europe, where we have a meaningful hydrogen business. ROCE has climbed steadily in the past -- last five quarters reaching 11.2%, which is 110 basis points higher than last year. We expect ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on stream and continue to put the cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for cash, our ROCE would have been 13.6% this quarter. Now please turn to slide 13 for a discussion of our full year EPS. Our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $1.39 or 15%. Volume was favorable at $0.80 and was particularly strong in Asia and the Americas. The increased sales equipment in our Corporate segment also helped drive higher volume. Price more than offset the significant energy cost increases adding $0.81, driven by our strong price action in our three largest segments. Our other costs were $0.84 unfavorable and were driven by external factors, such as inflation and inefficiencies caused by COVID restrictions in certain parts of China, as well as a supply chain disruption across the region. We also incurred additional costs purposefully to support our future growth. These include resources required to develop projects and bring them on stream, as well as investments and facilities such as our new helium storage cavern, which will generate significant value in the future. We continue to closely monitor our costs and are focused on productivity actions across our businesses. Currency lowered our earnings by $0.24 or 3% as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most key currencies in the latter half of the fiscal year. Since the revenue and cost are denominated in their respective local currencies, this is primarily a translation rather than a transaction impact. Equity affiliate income was up $0.74, primarily due to the first phase of our Jazan project, which contributed as we committed. Our effective tax rate of 18.2% was 70 basis points lower than last year and we expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2023. Interest expense was lower, adding $0.05 to earnings, primarily due to a reduced debt balance. Now please turn to slide 14 for a review of our fourth quarter results. In comparison to last year, we achieved double-digit growth for both sales and profits as our teams worked hard to overcome considerable macroeconomic headwinds. Each region found its own success and achieved better results through its respective key drivers, which will be detailed later in the regional review. Our underlying sales were up 17% with about equal contributions from both volume and price. Volumes are up 9% better, primarily in Asia and Americas, driven by new plants, recovery in hydrogen and better merchant volumes. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we achieved double-digit increase in merchant pricing, which was up 20% compared to last year. As cost pressures persist, we continue to work hard on pricing each region. Currency translated from the strengthening U.S. dollar negatively impacted our results this quarter, reducing sales by about 6% and EBITDA by 5%. Despite this headwind, EBITDA increased 10% and favorable price, volume and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. The 450-basis-point decline in EBITDA margin was primarily attributed to energy cost pass-through, which impacted margins by about 450 basis points. Sequentially, volumes improved across all segments and price increased primarily due to actions in our Europe segment. EBITDA was up 6% sequentially, absorbing 3% of currency headwinds and favorable price and volume more than offset higher costs. Now please turn to slide 15. Our fourth quarter GAAP EPS was $2.56 per share and included a negative impact of $0.32 for two non-GAAP items, both of which were non-cash. First, we recognized a $0.27 per share loss on the divestiture of our business in Russia, which we exited as a result of the Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as we had previously announced. This charge is separately presented as business and asset actions on our P&L. We also recognized a loss of $0.05 per share for the impairment of two small equity affiliates in Asia, which is included in the equity affiliate line item. Excluding the non-GAAP items, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.89 per share, an increase of $0.38 or 15% from prior year. We achieved this excellent result despite a negative $0.15 or 6% currency impact. Price, volume and cost together contributed $0.46. Volume contributed $0.33 and was particularly strong in Asia and America. Price, net of variable costs, was favorable $0.39 with Asia, Europe and the Americas each achieving significant price improvements. Price has improved throughout the year due to the outstanding efforts of our regional teams who helped us improve our pricing, net of variable costs, from a modest negative impact in the first quarter to a positive impact in each quarter’s since then. Other costs were $0.26 unfavorable. Almost half of the cost increases this quarter were due to higher incentive compensation, which is performance based and reflective of our strong results. The remaining increase was primarily due to inflation, supply chain disruptions, higher planned maintenance and the addition of resources needed to support our growth. Currency was negative $0.15, which was about $0.05 worse than we had expected when we provided Q4 guidance in July. The Jazan joint venture drove the improvement of equity affiliate income. However, many of our other equity affiliates compared unfavorably due to the strong performance last year, in part due to the lower medical oxygen demand for COVID this year. Now please turn to slide 16. The stability of our business allows us to generate strong cash flow despite the challenging environment. In fiscal year 2022, we generated more than $3 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $14 per share, which is up 15% compared to last year. From our distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or roughly $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders. This leaves more than $1.7 billion available for high return projects, 20% more than last year. This drawn cash flow, especially in uncertain times enable us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment for high return projects. Slide 17 provides an update of our capital deployment. As you see, our capital deployment potential has increased to about $37 billion through fiscal 2027. The $37 billion includes over $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, more than $17 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and $11 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity. As always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. So you can see, our backlog has grown to nearly $20 billion, which will provide substantial amount of growth in the future. We have already spent 30% and have already committed 73% of the updated capacity we show here. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high return projects. We believe that investing in these high return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. We continually evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders. Before I turn the call back to Seifi, I would like to mention that starting first quarter of fiscal 2023, we will exclude the non-service pension impact from our adjusted results. These non-service-related components and our defined benefit plans, including effects of the changing interest rates and movements of the capital markets are unrelated to our operations. By excluding these items, we believe that we can better provide visibility to our underlying results. The recap of earnings per share by quarter for fiscal year 2021 and 2022 are included in our reconciliation tables available on our websites. The EPS guidance for the first quarter and the full year of fiscal 2023, which Seifi will discuss in more detail later reflects this change. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I will turn the call back over to Seifi. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now please turn to slide number 18 for our Asia fourth quarter results. Sales and profit both improved double digits despite the continued currency headwinds. Volume and price together were up 19%, but they are partially offset by 7% weaker currencies. Volume by itself was up 15%, benefiting from new, small- to mid-sized traditional industrial gas plants in our on-site business across this region, as well as an increase in spot opportunities for sales. Merchant price was 9% stronger than last year, which increased the region’s overall sales by 3%. Price was up across the key countries and most major product lines. Continued COVID restrictions in certain parts of China modestly reduced volumes and created supply chain inefficiencies that contributed to higher distribution costs. EBITDA was up 13% after -- even after absorbing 7% of negative currencies, as favorable volume and price more than offset unfavorable costs and a lower contribution from our equity affiliates. Sequentially, the strong volume drove both sales and profit increase versus the previous quarter. Now I would like to turn the call to Simon to talk about our European fourth quarter results. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to slide 22. Power cost recovery via price for our merchant business is a primary focus to manage the ever higher energy costs in Europe. Our on-site business has contractual pass-through, which enables us to pass the energy cost to our customers and almost all of our natural gas usage is for on-site hydrogen production. As the chart shows, power costs for Europe this quarter soared to more than 5 times the level of the beginning of 2021. Our commercial team has tirelessly implemented price increases to compensate for these costs in our merchant business, turning a headwind at the beginning of the year to a tailwind by year end. Although, we have fully recovered the higher power costs for the year, we are keeping a watchful eye on energy costs heading into the winter season and we remain focused on power cost recovery in this region. . Now please turn to slide 23 for a review of our Europe results. In addition to significant energy cost increases, unfavorable currency movements also pressured our European businesses. All major local currencies were weaker versus the U.S. dollar by double digits. Compared to prior year, price increased 19% for the region, resulting from a 30% increase in merchant pricing. Prices were higher in all key sub-regions and product lines. Our volume was flat this quarter as a favorable contract amendment with an on-site electronics customer offset modestly weaker demand across our businesses. Additionally, our results no longer reflect our immaterial Russia business, which was divested in August. Negative currency reduced sales by 15% and EBITDA by 12% compared to last year. Despite this currency headwind, EBITDA improved 8% as positive price and better mix more than offset higher costs. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 750 basis points. Excluding this impact, margin was slightly higher than last year. Compared to the prior quarter, price contributed 5% via our ongoing price actions. Volume added another 5% driven by better hydrogen activities following a planned customer turnaround last quarter and the previously mentioned contract amendment. Despite a 5% currency headwind, EBITDA was up 5% as better price and volume more than covered the higher costs. EBITDA margin was relatively flat, excluding the negative impact of higher energy cost pass-through. Compared to Q1 of this year, Europe’s operating income has improved about $50 million or about 50%, thanks primarily to our team’s successful pricing efforts. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a discussion of our other segments.
Dr. Samir Serhan: Thank you, Simon. Now please turn to slide 24 for a review of our Americas results. Strong underlying sales accounted for half of the nearly 40% sales increase compared to last year, while the other half was due to higher energy cost pass-through, which had no profit impact but diluted our margins. Price improved for the region by 8%. This is equivalent to a 21% increase in our merchant business. Prices improved in all key product lines over last year. Our team in the Americas did an excellent job raising prices to more than cover the higher energy cost. Volume grew 12%, primarily due to improvements in merchant and hydrogen. We saw an increase in helium volume this quarter and the demand for hydrogen has been climbing steadily in the past several quarters. We expect hydrogen to follow this recovery path as we move into 2023. Planned maintenance activities have declined compared to last quarter as expected, but they were higher compared to last year. Maintenance activities were significantly below average in the fourth quarter last year. EBITDA grew 8% over last year, driven by positive price and volume, partially offset by higher costs and lower equity affiliate income. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 650 basis points. Sequentially, volume was up 4% and improved across all product lines. Price was also favorable, 1%, more than covering the higher variable cost. EBITDA increased 7%, mainly due to better price, volume and lower planned maintenance, which more than offset higher of our costs. Now please turn to slide 25 for a review of our Middle East and India segments. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly-owned operations are smaller in size. The segment EBITDA is, however, significant since it includes the with the affiliate income related to the design joint venture and our India joint venture INOX Air Products. For the quarter, sales were higher versus last year due to acquisitions. Operating income converted unfavorably to last year due to mainly unfavorable contract settlement in last year. We also expect planned maintenance activity to increase next quarter. The over $40 million increase in equity income included our share of the Jazan joint venture net profit, which is delivering as we expected. We have been receiving cash distributions from the joint venture. Please turn to slide 26 for our Corporate segment. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses, as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. For our sale of equipment activities, our LNG business historically has been under curve [ph], but our non-LNG related project activities have grown in recent years to become major contributors for this segment. The cadence of the project activities and the timing of sales and profit recognition can vary the segment’s results. Our ongoing effort to support our growth strategy has also increased the centrally managed functions and corporate costs. For the fiscal year, the segment EBITDA improved over $20 million, but the fourth quarter sales and profit were lower than last year primarily due to our sale of equipment project activities. We also added resources to support our growth strategy. As mentioned before, increase for potential LNG projects have jumped recently, but they will not drive our near-term results as these projects take time to develop. We are working hard to signing new projects to maintain the good momentum in this segment. At this point, I would like to turn the call back to Seifi to provide his closing comments. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. We believe that investing in high return projects is a better choice for our shareholders and share buyback in the long-term. We are also confident that we can deliver on near-term results while achieving our long-term goals. Although the projects that we seek to execute are large and take time, we have the competencies and the people to execute these projects and have been diligently working on them for many years to get to where we are. Now Air Products has entered a new phase of our company’s evolution, in which we expect a steady stream of meaningful contribution from these new projects going forward and for years to come. By choosing capital deployment over share buyback, we believe that we have traded quick gains in the near-term for greater reward in the future. Now please turn to slide number 27. Economies around the world continue to face considerable obstacles. The conflict in Ukraine persists, COVID restrictions in China may continue, we see that inflation, currency and supply chain issues will remain as headwinds. As always, we will push price -- we will push for price increases to compensate for additional costs, pursue additional volume opportunities, and obviously, pay close attention to our costs. With that background, for fiscal year 2023, we expect our earnings per share to be in the range of $11.20 to $11.50, representing an 11% increase at midpoint over last year. This includes an expected roughly $0.50 of negative currency impact. I would also like to add that our projections for next year are based on the fundamental assumption that the economies around the world performed as we see them today. That means we don’t have a crystal ball so we have not projected any economic growth around the world, neither have we projected a significant recession. Our guidance is based on what we see today in the economies in Americas, Europe and China. For quarter one of fiscal 2023 -- for first quarter of fiscal 2023, our earnings per share guidance is $2.60 to $2.80, up 5% to 13% over last year. Please also note that our prior results for the first quarter benefited from a gain of roughly $0.20 related to the finalization of the Jazan a separation unit joint venture. In terms of CapEx, we see our CapEx expenditure for next year to be approximately $5 billion to $5.5 billion, including the approximately $1 billion for the Phase 2 of the Jazan project. Now please turn to slide number 28. As you may recall from our last earnings call, I have been hosting in-person discussions with our employees across the regions to share our strategy and answer their questions. My goal is to talk with our more than 21,000 employees around the world over the course of the next year in small groups. I am happy to say that our employees around the world share our core values and focus on our common goals. Their commitment and motivation are truly a long-term competitive advantage. As I stated at the beginning of this call, I am proud to be working alongside them to make Air Products the leader of the clean energy future for the world. Now, we are more than pleased to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] I will now move to our first question, which comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Steve Byrne: Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about this greenfield project up in New York. The capital costs at $5 a watt seem a little high. Is this an undeveloped site, and maybe more importantly, what do you see as the primary demand for this product? It’s a pretty remote location. What would be the end markets that you are going to be selling this liquid hydrogen into?
Seifi Ghasemi: Excellent question. Good morning. First of all, in terms of the capital cost, this is a greenfield site. Number two, it includes, if you are comparing it, for example, to what we are doing at NEOM, it includes liquefaction, because we believe that the future of hydrogen for mobility is in full of liquids rather than gas hydrogen. Therefore, the facility is designed to include the liquefier and it also includes auxiliary investments in order to develop the site and also in terms of how we get the product to the customers. The primary market that we are targeting is, obviously, hydrogen for mobility. The site might seem remote, but once you have liquid hydrogen, the cost of distribution of liquid hydrogen is not that significant. We right now have liquid -- make liquid hydrogen in -- near Toronto in Canada and sell it in California. So the location we chose it because of the proximity to the power and the site that was there and access to the water. So I am not concerned about the distribution costs because that is not going to be that significant in the overall scheme of things. And besides that 35 tons a day, considering that any heavy truck on the average uses about 60 kilograms per day, you need about 600 trucks and it will consume the output of this facility. So we are very optimistic about it and we are very thankful to the State of New York, to NYPA and to the Governor for facilitating us locating in this location and using hydro power.
Steve Byrne: And Seifi, one follow-up for you on the European pricing results in merchants up 30%. Your two large competitors reported something similar. That’s really impressive. Can you comment on how much of that would be a surcharge that’s potentially reversible and would you characterize your primary merchant customers as the hydrogen cost is relatively modest in their cost deck and thus they can absorb a 30% increase?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the price increases in Europe are mainly on liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen and liquid argon and helium, and obviously, hydrogen, all related to the cost of electricity. And in addition to that, there is general inflation. So the cost increases are a reflection of the increase of our overall cost. So if electricity prices go down, it doesn’t mean that all of our costs are necessarily have gone down. And therefore, we are going to try to hang on to the price increases for as long as we can because a lot of it is justified just based on inflation rather than just purely power costs.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I am sure, Seifi, in your spare time, you read the Inflation Reduction Act. In calculating the tax benefit for your Louisiana facility, is it $85 a ton times 5 million tons or $425 million a year or is it a bigger number or a smaller number?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. The numbers are very clear in the Inflation Reduction Act with respect to CO2 sequestration. For every ton, you get $85, and obviously, our project in Louisiana is going to produce 5 million ton a year of CO2 that we plan to sequester, so your math is exactly correct. We will get a benefit of about $425 million, $430 million a year for 12 years in doing the sequestration after-tax. That is correct.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Second question maybe is for Melissa. In your cash flow statement, you have other adjustments for the year of negative $304.9 million, call it, negative $305 million, what is that? And your undistributed equity earnings are negative $215 million versus, I think, $481 million of equity income. Is that going to get any better in the future, so what’s the first number and is the second number going to improve?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. I can answer that question, but you wanted Melissa to answer. That’s not a problem. Melissa, would you please take that question?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yeah. So the other investing activities, is that your question, Jeff?
Jeff Zekauskas: The other adjustments, because other adjustment is negative $304.9 million, what’s that?
Melissa Schaeffer: Okay. Thank you. So that is largely intercompany CTA, Jeff. There is a portion of that is associated to one of our large projects deferred costs, but the massive majority is associated to our intercompany CTA.
Jeff Zekauskas: So does that change next year?
Melissa Schaeffer: So that will -- there will be a decrease next year associated again to that role, that the large project deferred cost, but it won’t change largely now.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And the undistributed earnings of equity method investments, are we going to get closer to the equity income?
Melissa Schaeffer: So, Jeff, that’s largely associated to our project for JIGPC and so the fluctuations in there is all just the timing of the distributions from that joint venture.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yeah. Thank you, Jeff.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now move on to our next question on the phone, which comes from Mr. John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you and welcome, Sidd. Seifi, for the clean hydrogen, other than sustainable aviation fuel, do you expect to have primarily a merchant pricing model where you don’t have any volume guarantees?
Seifi Ghasemi: For the hydrogen business? No, I think, that it will be a mixture, because I think some customers, even for when they are using it for fuel, like, large trucking firms and all of that, they would want to and they have talked about the possibility of long-term contracts to ensure supply. So I think that we will have a combination of both, John.
John Roberts: Thank you. I will past it on.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Thank you. 
Simon Moore: Operator, will you please go to the next question.
Operator: Certainly, sir. Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is David Wang [ph] here for Dave. I guess, on the SAF project, what’s the expanded scope on the SAF project include and is any of the increased investment due to any project cost inflation?
Seifi Ghasemi: The main reason is that the total capacity of the plant is approximately 340 million gallons a year. But the portion, that in the SAF has been increased, because with the IRA, as you know very well, there is going to be $1.25 incentive for making SAF. So we have changed the design of that plan to make more SAF and that is adding to the cost. Okay, Dave?
Unidentified Analyst: And then it looks like the Debang project in China has been delayed from second half 2023 to first half 2024. Can you talk about what’s causing the delay?
Seifi Ghasemi: It’s basically COVID-related and the COVID shutdowns that China is going through over there. Next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes to Mr. Josh Spector from UBS. Please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Seifi, I was wondering if I could clarify your assumptions for next year, I mean, particularly where you say no recession predicted. If you are kind of run rating current demand, I mean, I think, it’s arguable that Europe is in a recession, China is obviously underperforming. Are you assuming that that continues or are you assuming any improvement in those markets?
Seifi Ghasemi: No. We are not assuming any improvement in the markets. We are assuming improvement in our results, but we are saying that we have made our forecast for next year based on what we see today, that you are right, economic activity is down in Europe, it’s down in China and it’s debatable where it is in the U.S. We are basing our assumptions on currently what we see, that’s correct. We are not assuming any significant economic growth and we are not assuming any significant deterioration on where we are. Where we are is not a good place to be, but we are not expecting that to get much worse.
Josh Spector: Thanks. That’s helpful. And if I could just clarify, within like -- within Europe, what are the base volumes down? So I am not sure how much that contract amendment helped volumes, so just curious on the base level there?
Seifi Ghasemi: You mean the contract amendment with respect to what? I didn’t get it?
Josh Spector: On European volumes, you talked about volumes flat with the base business down the helped by the contract amendment for the volumes. So I am just wondering what the base volumes are in Europe today or in third -- in your September quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Are you referring to our on-site business or our merchant business? I think I am not relating to the contract amendment. Simon, can you help me maybe? Yeah. Any follow on…
Simon Moore: Yeah. Sure.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah.
Simon Moore: Yeah. So, in Europe, we said our volumes were roughly flat. We said we had a positive contract amendment and so our base volumes were down slightly. We didn’t quantify that, because of the details around the contract amendment, but the base volumes were down modestly, Josh.
Seifi Ghasemi: Right.
Josh Spector: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Okay.
Operator: I will now move on to our next question, sir, which comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, Seifi. So, I guess, first one would just be, when you think about the opportunities around the IRA bill and the potential for green versus, say, blue hydrogen and carbon sequestration. I guess when you look at your backlog of opportunities, not the ones that you have already announced but future ones? I guess which way would you say Air Products may be leaning, is there more opportunity, would you say, in the blue arena, in the carbon sequestration arena or would you say green is kind of going to be the next big push for you guys? How would you characterize it?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Good morning, John. Very good question. I would like to say, all of the above. That means that the IRA is very favorable about pursuing green hydrogen opportunities and we will do, as you saw with the announcement about the project in New York and we will do additional green hydrogen projects in the United States. And then the coverage castration and the $85 a ton will help us do additional blue hydrogen projects. We are -- as you know, we are committed to the transition and the IRA provides opportunity for us to do both of those things.
John McNulty: Okay. Fair enough.
Seifi Ghasemi: Is that okay, John?
John McNulty: Yeah. No. That’s fine. And then, I guess, the second question would just be, I saw you had signed, I guess, an agreement with one of the offshore -- a port project in the U.K. There was another one earlier in the year, I believe it was in the Netherlands. I guess can you speak to the confidence that you have around those regions actually taking in green ammonia, green hydrogen and the demand for it? Are you getting more comfortable with the demand environment in Europe for your green project most likely coming out of NEOM?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. There has been -- especially since the war in Ukraine, there has been significant additional conversations about the need for green. Some countries in Europe are very much committed to green. Some countries are considering also blue. But the level of conversation in terms of significant demand for green and blue hydrogen in Europe is noticeable. Yes, you are very right on that.
John McNulty: Okay. Thanks very much for the color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Seifi, with the New York project announcement, there’s a reference to potentially building a fueling station network in the Northeast. Could you talk a little bit more about that and what would sort of get you over the line on that project?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, obviously, we have the liquid hydrogen. In order to sell it, we would need hydrogen refueling stations at different locations so that the trucks can come and stop buy and get fuel. There are a lot of options about how we are doing that and we are exploring all of those options. This is something that we know how to do. I think we already have about 112 of these stations or more than that around the world. We have patents. We know how to build these things. We know how to design these. And I have to say that, I think, we are at the forefront of technology for these kind of especially liquid stations. So we will be building those in order to be able to sell the product.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And just as a follow-up, post the IRA, there’s been a lot of announcements, no surprise, for projects in the U.S. How are you thinking about the risk of CapEx inflation in the United States post the IRA?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think, in the context of the U.S. economy, even you add up that all of those projects are real projects rather than just MOUs. But I mean, it’s not enough to kind of affect the inflation of the cost of a plant that you are going to build in the U.S., I don’t think so. We are not focused on that. We don’t think that’s relevant.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move to our next question over the phone, which comes from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just one clarifying question, I think, for Melissa. But, Seifi, if you want to answer, that would be great, too. The pension adjustment you are now making for adjusted EPS. I think, in your reconciliation, you disclosed it was a $34 million income in fiscal 2022. I understand you plan to exclude it from adjusted EPS going forward. But Melissa, what is your best estimate of what that line item might be for 2023?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Melissa should answer that. She does a better job than I would do on this. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yeah. Thank you, Seifi. Yeah. So for the non-service components, so if I look back at FY 2022, that was about $0.15 benefit. But we are forecasting for FY 2023 an anticipated $0.35 headwind moving forward.
Mike Leithead: Got it. And just to clarify, the $0.35 is just in that one year, it’s not year-over-year, $0.35, correct?
Melissa Schaeffer: That’s correct. It’s readjusted every year.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you so much.
Melissa Schaeffer: And we will -- yes, absolutely, we will provide a reconciliation table for that.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, Seifi, about what you are seeing in Europe with regard to natural gas prices. There’s been a recent decline there, obviously, that impacts the pass-through. But do you think that maybe changes your ability to get pricing and do you have any encouraging feedback from customers that they are going to be running harder now that they are seeing some relief on natural gas costs?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Good morning, Mike. I think the natural gas prices increases in Europe have moderated, but there’s still natural gas prices in Europe are around $30 a 1 million Btu, which is 6 times or 7 times what they used to be. In terms of the natural gas prices, as you correctly said, is mostly attached to cost for us. The relevant thing becomes if that higher natural gas costs affect the cost of electricity, which they do. And we haven’t seen the electricity prices moderating as much as obviously the -- or other people would like to see it, but I do not expect a significant change. But energy prices, as we all know, are pretty unpredictable. It depends on a lot of things, so I don’t want to speculate on that. But the one thing that I hope, Mike, we have demonstrated is that we have the ability, the agility and the determination to be flexible and react to that and recover the cost increases, which we have done. I think that’s the good news.
Mike Harrison: All right. Thank you for that. And then my other question is on the hydrogen business in the U.S., kind of two pieces to this question. First of all, are you starting to see some better utilization and better hydrogen spot volumes from your refinery customers as we see diesel stocks being relatively low? And can you comment at all on the maintenance outages that you are expecting in Q1 compared to Q4 levels, is it going to be a greater cost than you saw in Q4? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure, Mike. I would like to have Dr. Serhan answer that question. He mentioned something about that in his prepared remarks. But Dr. Serhan, would you like to kind of expand on your remarks about hydrogen demand?
Dr. Samir Serhan: I mean, definitely, it’s been picking up as we stated before in the last few quarters. So we are at the level now in our pipeline system in Texas, Louisiana really to the level before COVID and is still even recovering further. The refineries our customers basically have the high utilization. The demand is very high. And definitely, we see more opportunities for additional volume and we are really doing our best to add even more capacity to our pipeline system, so we can supply our customers.
Mike Harrison: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now move to our next question over the phone, which comes from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, guys. First question is just around the APAC business. The volumes there were very strong, up 16% relative to only up 2% last quarter. And Seifi, I think, you called out a number of kind of smaller traditional ASUs starting up. So is it fair to anniversary that number over the next three quarters that APAC should be very strong just because of the business that we have built in already?
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, Duffy. How are you? I -- you are asking a very, very good question and thank you for noticing. The fact that we have grown our traditional business, we are not just focused on large projects in that part of the world. Theoretically, what you are saying is correct. The only unpredictable thing in this is what is going to happen to these shutdowns in China, because right now one of the provinces that we operate is Shanxi Province that found some COVID cases in some of the coal mines and then now the whole state is shutdown and all that. Those things do affect our business in the short-term, so and that -- they are totally unpredictable. But if you assume that none of those things will happen, obviously, the fact that we are bringing these new facilities online, they have helped last quarter and they will help in the future, absolutely.
Duffy Fischer: Perfect. And then maybe one just on your crystal ball because you have seen a few cycles. When you see the data you have coming in, when you look at the world around you and you look at your customers, how do you think this cycle plays out kind of through this quarter into the early part of next year? Is there another leg down for your broader customer base or do you think we have kind of put in the trough here in the calendar Q4 and things get better as we get into next year?
Seifi Ghasemi: So, Duffy, I am a little bit hesitant to predict that, because, obviously, with our business, we are a leading indicator in terms of -- since we don’t have any inventory, I can tell you exactly what is happening now. But -- and now you know the state of affairs. But predicting what is going to happen in the next month or two months or three months, especially both in China and also in the U.S. and all of that, with so many different things moving would be very difficult. But this is why, as I said, for our guidance, we assume that things are the way they are right now rather than predicting any of or down. So we have to wait and see. Sorry about that. I can’t be specific with that.
Duffy Fischer: No. That…
Seifi Ghasemi: That was specific enough.
Duffy Fischer: Fair enough. Thank you, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. When you are looking at the world right now, can you just give us a quick update on where your rough estimates are for merchant operating rates in terms of just what you are seeing in the macro? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure, Chris. Good morning. Yes.
Christopher Parkinson: Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: I can give you that. I mean, right now, if you look at all of Asia, we are at around 77%, 78%. Europe is, depending on which country you are, it goes somewhere from as high as maybe 81%, 82% in U.K. to as low as 72%, 73% in certain parts of Europe. And in the U.S., we are at around 77%, 78%.
Christopher Parkinson: Very helpful. And Seifi, entirely understanding that you don’t necessarily have a crystal ball, obviously, there’s been a lot of fluctuation in regional macro activity this year. It’s been -- all been caused by various factors in Europe and China and so on and so forth. But if we just circle back to a previous question on China, I mean, what’s your best, as you know, I mean, what’s your best view of the outlook for the Chinese economy after the Lunar New Year next year in terms of what you are hearing from the ground, what you are hearing for your customers, just any insights would be very helpful? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Chris, thank you very much. Obviously, in China, everybody is, obviously, when they talk to you, nobody wants to be pessimistic that, everybody wants to be optimistic. So it’s very difficult based on the input that you get talking to different people to make an estimate of what the real economy will do. I do not expect a significant change up or down. I think it will be steady. But who knows what’s going to happen. But right now, it’s my best estimate is exactly what we have put in our -- for our guidance is that things will stay where they are currently in terms of utilization and in terms of the GDP growth, okay.
Christopher Parkinson: Understood. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you very much. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Cory Murphy: Hi. Good morning. This is Cory Murphy on for Kevin. Two questions on your project pipeline. First, press release highlighted $1.3 billion of major projects in electronics, and on slide 30 I see $900 million in Taiwan. What are the major projects you have in electronics, any color you can provide on timing, location and future activity would be helpful? And then second, it appears as though the net zero hydrogen project in Alberta increased in size by C$300 million to C$1.6 billion. Why is that and what impact might that increase have on your project return expectations? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. In terms of the Canadian operation, the increase was a little bit of changes in Scope and also with respect to once we got finalized with our customer about what they wanted. The return on that project is still very good, because we adjusted the prices to compensate for that. So I don’t expect any downside on that, and actually, we will have some more to say about that project in the next few weeks. With respect to the electronic projects, I can’t say more than what we have disclosed, because we are under confidentiality agreement with the customers and the customers don’t want us to talk about the project because they don’t want anybody to know where it is and what they are doing. But you have the details. It’s the $900 million in Taiwan for the very big semiconductor manufacturer. So you can almost guess what that is and the other one is for some other people. So I can’t give you any more -- be any more specific than what we have already been, because of the restrictions by our customers.
Cory Murphy: Understood. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dan Rizzo: Thank you. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned a little bit about COVID disruptions affecting supply chain and some projects in China. I was wondering if they are affecting your operations or your customer’s operations as well.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the reason we mentioned is that, because they did affect our operations, because it caused, most of these lockdowns affect our distribution costs and sometimes it causes some of the plans to have to shut down. So the reason we mentioned it is because they did have an effect on our operations. Yes.
Dan Rizzo: And just final question, just given the current environment with interest rates, is debt pay down a focus at all? I mean, I know you have a solid rating, but I was just wondering if it’s something that you are considering given the potentially elevating costs?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, our debt is in form of bonds. It’s not -- most of our debt -- we have approximately $7.5 billion, $8 billion of debt. Most of it is corporate bonds, which -- where the interest rates are fixed and we will pay them down based on the schedule that we have in the bond payments. And we disclose those, so you can see when you are supposed to pay down significant amounts of our debt, okay.
Dan Rizzo: All right. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Eric Petrie from Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Petrie: Hi. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, Eric, how are you?
Eric Petrie: Good. Any update or expected potential milestones from your MOU with Cummins and developing fuel cells for heavy-duty trucks?
Seifi Ghasemi: They are working on it and they are -- they have the truck and the development and we are looking forward and receiving the trucks. I think they are a little bit delayed in terms of the schedule that they have promised us. But we are -- we continue working with them. And I have to say that…
Eric Petrie: Great.
Seifi Ghasemi: … we also are working with other people, too. It’s not just Cummins.
Eric Petrie: Okay. And then on your New York green hydrogen project, I think, CapEx translates to roughly $14 million a ton per day. How do you see that for future green hydrogen projects going forward and the reduction in costs between electrolyzer, power and liquefication costs?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the cost is very much location dependent in terms of how much work do you have to do, in terms of greenfield site, existing sites, what are the things that you have to do in order to get a real project going. But I don’t expect the cost of building green hydrogen projects to significantly come down. There is no reason for that. We have inflation. And this thing about the fact that cost of electrolyzers will go down is a myth, number one, and number two, the electrolyzers are not a significant part of the cost of building the green hydrogen facility. So that is just something promoted by somebody, I don’t know who. But in the real world, the cost of building a plant two years from now or five years from now or three years from now will be higher because of inflation. So the sooner you build these things, the better it is.
Eric Petrie: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: That okay? Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question over the phone, which comes from Sebastian Bray from Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Sebastian Bray: Hello. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I would have two, please. The first one follows up on the earlier question on interest costs. If I look at the refinancing schedule for Air Products and the expansion in CapEx over the next two years or three years, the current interest charge in 2021 was $128 million. Melissa, would it be plausible for this number to double the space of two years or three years? That’s my first question. My second one is on changes in the Scope to investments. We have had two or three investments be upscaled. Is there a chance at all that the same thing could happen to Louisiana and the $4.5 billion blue hydrogen project? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. I will have Melissa answer the first question that you had and the second question that you had with respect to the project in Louisiana. We are looking based on the Investment Reduction Act about the Scope of that project and we might actually change the Scope and increased the Scope, and as a result, increase the capital cost for that project. So that all depends on what we conclude in terms of what is the best options for us to take advantage of the legislation. So, yeah, it is possible that we would, say, a year from now, two years from now, that we have increased the Scope of that project and we spent, I don’t know, $5 billion or $7 billion on that project, depending on what we decide to do. So, now, Melissa, would you like to answer the first question, please?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yeah. Thank you, Seifi. So we have talked a lot about a crystal ball. Obviously, we don’t have a crystal ball of where interest rates are going to go. But we don’t anticipate them moving up to a double level in the next year. That being said, right now, given our current access to the liquidity market, we actually don’t anticipate having to go to the debt market in the near-term. But obviously, we are always evaluating the market and the rate that we obtained given our AA2 rating.
Sebastian Bray: That’s helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yeah. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions queued over the phone at this time. Mr. Ghasemi, I would like to turn the conference back over to you, sir, for any additional or closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. Thank you very much. I would just like to thank everybody for listening to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. As I said earlier, please stay safe and healthy and all the very best. Thank you very much and also thank you very much for the very good questions. We appreciate it. Have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you very much for the speakers. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-08-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Cecilia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide number 2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a total company and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very, very busy schedule to be on our call today. Our fiscal year 2022 third quarter results are the latest demonstration of the strength and resilience of our business portfolio. Despite all the well-known and visible headwinds on the global stage, such as rampant inflation, supply chain constraints, currency headwinds, COVID-related shutdowns in China, the war in Ukraine and the significant rise in energy prices in Europe. The people of Air Products delivered excellent results with earnings per share, up 13% versus last year. In addition, as you can see, we delivered very strong cash flow that will support our energy transition growth projects. I do want to thank all of the people at Air Products for the total commitment to excellence and service to our customers. Now please turn to Slide number 3, our safety performance. Our highest priority at Air Products is the safety and well-being of our employees. We have made significant progress to improve our safety performance in the last few years. But we are working even harder to achieve our ultimate goal of 0 incidents and accidents. Now, please turn to slide number 4. This is our historical performance over the last eight years, and the best indication of our commitment and the resilience of our business portfolio. We have increased our earnings per share by an average of 11% per year over the last eight years despite all of the ups and downs in the world economy, geopolitical tensions, and COVID. This performance is better than what we promised investors eight years ago. Now please to slide number 5, which clearly indicates that we have shared the success with our investors by increasing our dividend per share by an average of 10% per year also. Now, please go to slide number 6. My favorite slide that shows our EBITDA margins. You'll note, the significant improvement over the years and please also note that about three-quarters of the recent decline is due to higher pass-through energy costs that increase our sales, but not our properties. I have as usual included slides number 7, 8, 9 and 10 to emphasize our continued commitment to the basic management principles that have guided our performance up to now and will continue to be the key principles that we will follow in the future. Slide number, 11, 12 and 13 represent our new sustainability commitments that we shared on Monday July 25, at the conference call. The transcript of that call explains all of these slides in detail. So I do not plan to go through that again today. But I do want to reiterate that, sustainability is our growth strategy at Air Products, and we are committed to improving our performance and enabling our customers to do the same. We are proud to have set additional ESG goals and increased our total capital expenditure for projects driving the energy transition to $15 billion or more. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Chief Financial Officer to go through the details of the fiscal year third quarter results. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As mentioned earlier, the resilience of our business is once again demonstrated on results this quarter. Our on-site business, which generates approximately half of our total company sales is stable and has contractual protection to pass through higher energy costs. Our merchant business also performed very well. Price stayed ahead of variable cost increases for the second consecutive quarter, and how has now more than offset the higher variable costs, for the year-to-date. I'm also pleased to announce that, we received a cash distribution of approximately $100 million from the Jazan joint venture in June, another example of this project meeting our commitments. I also would like to echo Seifi's comments, and thank all of our people at Air Products for their outstanding effort to overcome the significant energy cost challenges, and achieve key project milestones. Now please turn to Slide 14 for our third quarter results. Underlying sales were strong. Price and volume combined were up 12%. So energy costs have fallen slightly in recent weeks, they remain significantly higher than in prior quarters and our team stepped up our pricing efforts across the region in response to the escalating energy costs. Our third quarter merchant price was 17% higher than last year, which resulted in a 7% gain for the total company. Merchant price has improved double digits for three consecutive quarters and increased sequentially each quarter. Volumes were up 5% overall and better in most segments. New assets recovery and hydrogen in the Americas better merchant demand and increased sales of equipment activities more than offset the negative COVID impacts in Asia and lower hydrogen volumes in Europe. Currency translation from a strengthening US dollar was a significant headwind this quarter, reducing sales and EBITDA by 5%. Despite this headwind, EBITDA increased 11% as favorable volume, prices and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin of 33.9% decreased 360 basis points compared to the prior year, as positive contributions from price, equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher energy pass-through, which lowered EBITDA margin by 500 basis points. Sequentially, volumes were up 4%, supported by Lunar New Year recovery in Asia and higher hydrogen volumes in the Americas by partially offset by lower merchant demand due to the COVID restrictions in China. EBIT was up 6% sequentially, absorbing 2% of currency headwinds, as favorable price and volume more than offset higher costs. ROCE has climbed steadily the last four quarters to reach 10.8%. We anticipate ROCE to further improve as we bring new projects on stream and continue to put the abundant cash on our balance sheet to work. Adjusting for this cash, our ROCE would have been 13.5% this quarter. Now please turn to Slide 15. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $2.62 increased $0.31, or 13% from the prior year, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year earnings growth. Price, volume and costs together contributed $0.27. Volume was favorable $0.11 and price net of variable cost was favorable $0.32. Asia, Europe and Americas all showed positive price results. Our costs were higher primarily due to inflation supply chain-related issues, and higher planned maintenance. We also remain steadfast in our support for the long-term growth of our company, hiring the necessary people to bring projects on stream and investing in facilities including our new helium storage cavern, which will generate significant value in the future. We keep a close eye on all of our costs and continue to focus on productivity actions across all of our businesses. Weaker foreign currency versus US dollar lowered our EPS $0.08. The euro, British pound, Korean won and RMB were the biggest contributors. This was about $0.05 worse than we expected for the quarter. The Jazan joint venture continues to deliver as expected and drove the improved equity affiliate income versus prior year. Noncontrolling interest was unfavorable as higher earnings from consolidated joint ventures is attributed to our partners. Nonoperating income was $0.04 lower, driven by higher pension expense. Our third quarter effective tax rate of 18.6% was slightly higher than last year as the favorable impact of Jazan in the current year was offset by prior year impact of favorable onetime items. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 19% next quarter. Now please turn to Slide 16. The stability of our business allows us to generate strong cash flow, despite the challenging geopolitical energy environment. Over the last 12 months, we generated more than $2.9 billion of distributable cash flow over $13 per share. From our EBITDA of over $4 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital.  From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or roughly $1.4 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have over $1.5 billion available for high-return projects. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times enabling us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment for our high-return projects. Slide 17 provides an update to our capital deployment. As you can see our capital deployment potential is $35 billion through fiscal 2027. The $35 billion includes about $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today almost $17 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and more than $10 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative, given the potential for additional EBITDA growth which would generate additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity. As always, we continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current and targeted AA2 rating. So, you can see, we have already spent 30% and have already committed 73% of the updated capacity, we show here. We've made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects. As Seifi mentioned we have committed an additional $4 billion to the future energy transition projects or about half of the remaining $9.5 billion to be committed. We are developing a significant number of exciting projects. As a result, I think we have a good chance to exceed this target. We continually evaluate our capital deployment options and determine the best way to use the available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value for the long run. Now to begin the review of our segment results I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. 
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide number 18 for our Asia results. As I mentioned earlier, currency was a major failure  for Asia this quarter. Sales were flat as positive volume and price that offset by weaker currency. Volume was up 2%, as we continue to successfully bring on a stream -- being on a stream a small to medium-sized traditional industrial gas plants in our on-site business across the region, which more than offset the reduced merchant volumes caused by COVID restrictions in certain parts of China in the last quarter. Our merchant price was up 5% compared to last year, which resulted in the 2% overall price improvement for the region. Costs were unfavorable primarily due to higher planned maintenance, inflation and supply chain inefficiencies caused by COVID restrictions. EBITDA was 5% lower mostly due to currency and EBITDA margin decreased 230 basis points as better price and volume only partially offset the higher costs. Now I would like to turn the call over to Simon to talk about our Europe results. Simon? 
Simon Moore: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to slide 19. Energy costs in Europe remained very high, but had no profit impact on our on-site business since we are contractually able to pass the cost on to our customers. Since almost all of our natural gas usage is for on-site hydrogen production we have very little cost exposure to natural gas and no cost exposure to the power used for our on-site ASUs. In our merchant business our team continues to implement price increases to compensate for higher power costs highlighting the strength of our business model. You can see the power cost for Europe this quarter were still three times the level at the beginning of 2021. Although, we have now fully recovered the higher power costs for the year-to-date we remain mindful of the dynamic nature of the situation and we are continuing to work hard on pricing. Now please turn to slide 20 for a review of our Europe results. Negative currency had a significant impact on Europe. All major local currencies were weaker versus the dollar by double-digits. Compared to prior year underlying sales were stable supported by a sizable step-up in merchant pricing. Price increased 17% over last year for the region which translates to a 25% gain for the merchant business. Prices were higher across all major product lines and subregions and this is the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential price increases. Volume was 3% weaker. Merchant volume was up, but hydrogen volume was negatively impacted by a planned customer turnaround and another customer reducing volume from us due to high natural gas costs. EBITDA improved 4% due to strong price net of variable costs and better equity affiliate income, which were partially offset by unfavorable currency and weaker volume. EBITDA margin decreased 500 basis points compared to prior year as better pricing net of variable costs only partially offset higher energy cost pass-through which lowered margin more than 700 basis points. Compared to the prior quarter, merchant volume improved and price continued to gain strength across all key product lines and subregions. EBITDA was up 9% as better price net of variable costs more than offset weaker currency. EBITDA margin improved 230 basis points primarily due to the strong price. Compared to Q1 of this year, Europe's operating income has improved $40 million or 40% and EBITDA margin has increased by over 600 basis points, owing much to our team's successful pricing effort. Now I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a discussion of our other segments.
Samir Serhan: Thank you Simon. Now please turn to slide 21 for a review of our Americas results. Energy cost pass-through was a significant factor this quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the 33% sales increase over last year, but contributing no profit. However, it does negatively impact our margins. Underlying sales were strong. Volume and price together were up 12% similar to the last two quarters. Volume grew 4% primarily due to recovery in hydrogen despite the planned outages in this quarter, as well as a new on-site coming online. We expect hydrogen to continue its path to recovery as we move into 2023. Our third quarter volume growth was partially offset by continued weakness in our South America merchant business due to lower demand for medical oxygen as well as the favorable impact from our onetime items in the previous year. As mentioned, the positive price momentum continued. Our team in the Americas did an excellent job again by raising the prices to more than cover the higher energy costs. Prices improved in all key product lines over last year and were also up sequentially. The 8% gain for the region compared to last year is equivalent to an 18% increase in our merchant business. As we indicated previously a planned maintenance was still elevated in the third quarter, but it's expected to decrease in this fourth quarter. Costs were also unfavorable primarily due to inflation and supply chain related challenges including driver shortages that continued to impact the industry. EBITDA grew 3% driven by higher price and volume, partially offset by higher costs. EBITA margin declined 980 basis points from the previous year due to higher energy cost pass-through, which accounted for around 800 basis points with most of the rest driven by onetime gains in the previous year. Sequentially our hydrogen volume and continued price gains helped to drive EBITDA higher, despite higher supply chain-related costs. EBITDA margin was lower primarily due to higher energy cost pass-through. Now please turn to slide 22 for a review of our Middle East and India segment. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly-owned operations are smaller in size. However, the segment's EBITDA is significant since it includes the equity affiliate income related to the design joint venture and our India joint venture INOX AP. For the quarter, sales were higher versus the previous year, and previous quarter due to acquisitions. The $50 million increase in equity affiliate income included our share of the design joint venture net profit. As Melissa indicated earlier, we received a distribution of about $100 million from the joint venture during the third quarter. And I'm also happy to report that the planned commissioning activities continue to make good progress. Please turn to Slide 23 for our Corporate segment. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Over the past few years, our non-LNG, sale of equipment businesses have grown considerably and have become major contributors for this segment. For this quarter sales and profit increased driven by strong activities in non-LNG projects and also supported by favorable profit recognition upon the recent completion of an LNG sale of equipment project. As expected, inquiries for potential LNG projects have increased significantly, but these projects take time to develop we're working hard to sign in new projects in order to maintain our momentum. At this point, I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing comments.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. As I have mentioned previously, our strategy for the company is fundamentally based on doing two things at the same time two pillars. Number one is to operate our base industrial gas business in the most efficient way and continue to invest and grow that business, something that we have been doing and we will continue to do. The second pillar of our strategy is to focus on zero and low carbon hydrogen projects that produce the hydrogen energy of the future. Air Products today is the leader in the production of gray hydrogen worldwide. Our strategy is to have a natural extension of that leadership position and to be the leader in the production of green hydrogen based on renewable resources and blue hydrogen, which is the production of hydrogen from hydrocarbons combined with CO2 capture. That is our growth strategy for the future. We are very much committed to this strategy. These two pillars are part of the same thing. They fit together. They align with our core competencies as a company and they give us the potential to grow significantly. As the world's largest hydrogen supplier with over 60 years of experience with hydrogen, we are uniquely positioned to be successful in implementing this strategy. We have the know-how to carry out our mega projects and implement them successfully as demonstrated by the successful completion of several major projects recently, including a more than $2 billion air separation projects the largest in the world, which was completed on time and their budgets recently. We can also leverage our existing assets as many of our energy transition projects are connected to our own pipelines, which can readily supply the low-carbon hydrogen to our existing customers. Now, please turn to slide number 24. Like everyone else, we see significant economic challenges as we go forward. COVID restrictions in China remain uncertain, and we expect inflation, currency and supply chain constraints to continue to be headwinds. Although, we have only a very small business in Germany, the field of energy supply distributions is weighing on all of Europe. Despite all of these headwinds, I remain confident in the strength and stability of Air Products business. We will push for price increases to compensate for additional costs, pursue additional volume opportunity, and pay very close attention to our costs. As a result for the fiscal year 2022, we have kept our guidance unchanged despite not only all of these headwinds, but also the more than $0.10 of negative currency impact that we see which is different â which is higher than when we gave you the guidance last quarter. Our range of $10.20 to $10.40 represents, a 14% increase at midpoint over last year. We expect to see our CapEx in 2022, to be slightly above $4.5 billion, including the approximately $1.5 billion previously invested for Phase 1 of the Jazan project. Now please turn to slide number 25. To make this energy transition in reality, we need people, who share the same vision for this important undertaking. Recently, I've been hosting strategy discussions, with our employees around the world. These are extensive thoughtful dialogues, with small groups of people at the time that allow me to share our strategy with our people and as always to answer their questions and get input from them. I have already met with approximately 2,000 of our employees in the last two months and our plan to talk to all of our 20,000 employees in small groups in the next year or so. I'm happy to say that, our employees are excited, motivated, and confident, to take on the bold challenges ahead of us. Their commitment and motivation is our long-term competitive advantage, which is going to make us successful in implementing our strategy. I am have been, and continue to be very excited about the future of Air Products. Now, before we answer your questions, I do have an announcement to make. As all of you on this call know, -- all of you on this call, know my friend and colleague Mr. Simon Moore very well. He has been responsible for Investor Relations for the last 12 years. He has been a significant contributor to the success of Air Products over the last 33 years. Recently, Simon informed me that he plans to spend more time with his family and therefore visions to retire from Air Products at the end of March 2023. We have decided to announce this decision early, so that we can go about finding a successor in an open and public manner and also to give his successor plenty of time for the transition. I do want to publicly acknowledge and thank Simon for the outstanding and valuable contribution he has made to Air Products and also acknowledge the key role he has played in developing our sustainability program. All of us at Air Products wish Simon the best in his retirement and look forward to working with him over the next eight months to identify and transition to a strong successor. Simon, thank you again for all we have done for Air Products and I invite you to make any comments you would like to make at this time.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Seifi. I have been honored to enjoy the challenges, the opportunities, the people and the teamwork at Air Products over the last 30-plus years. As they say, no one joins the company planning to stay for 30 years, but I have been lucky to be challenged with a wide variety of opportunities that always made Air Products a great place to be. Seifi, as we discussed when I first shared my decision with you I remain fully supportive of Air Products' growth strategy, continuing to focus on our very strong base business, while we further advanced our unique first-mover advantages driving the sustainability-focused energy transition for the world will no doubt create significant value for our investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders. And Seifi, I want to specifically thank you for leading the team to transform Air Products into this great company with an incredible future. I'm looking forward to continuing to drive our critical work support the search for an outstanding successor and ensure a smooth transition. Thanks again, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much Simon for your kind remarks. I do appreciate that. Now we are pleased to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you.  We will now take our first question from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much for taking my question. Your team has done a very good job over the last several quarters, obviously from a pretty tough place last October to getting ahead on price cost in both Europe and also the US per your PowerPoint slides. Can you just discuss those efforts in the context of the current macroeconomic environment. Obviously, there's some potential tracks in Europe and some other places. So just how are those discussions going on now? How should we think about your ability to hold price into the next fiscal year? Just any additional color on the -- your updated thought process? Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Chris and good morning to you.
Christopher Parkinson: Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: And Chris thanks for your comments. I appreciate that. We are very confident that we will be able to continue doing what we have been doing in the last three quarters in order to deal with all of the headwinds that we are dealing with. We have significant headwinds in currency, COVID, energy costs, and all of that. We believe that we have the capacity the resilience, the strength, and the market position to continue to increase prices to compensate for energy costs and other inflationary factors. So, we are not going to fall behind on that as we have demonstrated in the last three quarters and I expect those efforts to continue. The second thing is that our people are phenomenally focused on our costs making sure that we have by really count for every penny and Melissa, in her role as CFO, is playing a leading role in interacting with our businesses around the world to make sure they understand their cost and we keep our eyes on the ball in making sure that we are not spending on any money that you don't have to spend on. So, putting all of these together that is why we have had on honestly the courage considering everything that is going to be thrown at us in the next quarter not to change our forecast for the year and stick with the $10.20 to $10.40 which means at midpoint $10.30 and knowing full well that we are going to be hit with at least $0.10 of currency headwind. So, we are going to keep doing what we have been doing and I'm very confident that we should be successful Chris. 
Christopher Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up. In your last slide presentation for the last quarter you had slide 11 just kind of the update of the fiscal year 2023 major project considerations. I mean Juda Jazan, Debang GCA so on and so forth. Can you just give us a quick update on any incremental thoughts you have on those kind of that second stage of getting Lu'An back to prior levels. Just any color you could offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. We fully expect Lu'An to go back to the original contract starting October 1. And all of those other projects that you mentioned do you expect them to come on a screen in 2023 and contribute to our increased EPS versus this year. So, we look forward to having a good year in 2023.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone. Congratulations in advance Simon. Seifi can you talk about -- you mentioned you had $0.10 incremental FX headwinds versus I guess the middle of your fiscal year. Obviously, the raw material environment the macro environment hasn't gotten any easier either. So, what is it that's happening in the business? It's better than what you expected that's allowing you to maintain the guidance?
Seifi Ghasemi: I see two things. Number one, our ability to make sure that we increase prices to keep up with inflation; and the second thing is that, there are pockets of our business which are doing better than we expected, to be very specific, the hydrogen pipeline in the Gulf Coast, because of what you know very well about increased activity for refineries. So that is helping us.
Vincent Andrews: And...
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, sure go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: No, no, go ahead, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I was done. Thank you, Vincent.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, I was just wondering, as we think about the potential for energy or electricity issues possibly in the fourth quarter maybe the first calendar quarter of this year depending on what happens -- what are your mitigation plans in terms of -- do you have the capability to shift volume to certain plants to serve the merchant market, if you have to reduce production, or are customers proactively maybe global customers proactively maybe shifting some volume to other geographies, or what are your contingency plans?
Seifi Ghasemi: We have a lot of flexibility to deal with that, if that is what the customers want to dom because they have many, many operations that can be -- we do that all the time in order to manage our electricity costs, because when electricity costs go up significantly during the night or during the day depending on where you are. We shut down some -- slow down some facilities and ramp it later. So we have a lot of flexibility to deal with that. You must be referring specifically to any possible electricity shortages in Europe, as a result of the cutoff of the natural gas to that region. But if that happens, then we just -- we'll adjust our operations to what the customersâ wishes.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. On the Jazan dividend, will this be an ongoing quarterly dividend or semiannual, or how should we think about the dividend going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, obviously, the dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the company, but we expect to be getting a regular dividend. That's the expectation and we got the dividend this quarter and I expect -- I don't want to say this every single quarter. But in general, over the course of the year, we expect to get the dividend that is necessary or expected as per the -- our investment agreement. As the company -- the good news as Dr. Serhan mentioned is that the plant is operating, the commissioning is going well. And we have an outstanding customer in Saudi Aramco which happens to be generating a lot of cash themselves. So...
David Begleiter: Very good. And now that we're almost through this current year, any early thoughts on fiscal '23 earnings?
Seifi Ghasemi: David, I'm -- I would not want to venture into that. You have to give me until beginning of November to give you a guidance for that. So, I don't really want to comment too much on that, but I am optimistic, because we do have significant plans coming on the stream and therefore I'm expecting good 2023. But in terms of exactly where we will be, it depends on the world economy and all of that but we will obviously give you a forecast for that in â when we announced our results at the end of October or early November. 
David Begleiter: Very good. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thanks, David.
Operator: Will now take our next question from John Roberts from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Best wishes, Simon. And I'm going to ask just one question. Seifi the press release mentions the potential green hydrogen project in Oman, which you've talked about before. But it also mentions the Netherlands and the UK for green hydrogen. I don't think you've talked about that before. Could you give us a little bit more information there? 
Seifi Ghasemi: John, first of all good morning. You're asking a very good question. Give us a really bit of time to sort out the details of that before we make any public comments. Yes we are looking at possibility of a green hydrogen project in the Netherlands using the wind energy that they have. But we haven't finalized everything. We just wanted to let people know that they are working on those. But once we have finalized the details we will make an appropriate announcement. 
John Roberts: Yes, thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Seifi as you look a few years into the future do you think that demand for clean hydrogen projects around the world will begin to exceed the industrial gas industry's practical ability to fund them. In other words, I look at Slide 12, you have a yellow box there. Obviously, you linked a lot of projects already. You have perhaps Oman and the other ones that John just asked about, the $4 billion number toward the right of the slide is not especially large relative to your balance sheet or relative to the market opportunity for clean hydrogen. So what happens as the demand for these projects continues to rise and the capital is extended? Do you think that will exert upward tension on future returns, or how might the industry respond? 
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all good morning Kevin, you're asking a very excellent question. I think as the demand goes up, the ability to finance these projects become easier. And I think in time we will obviously tell you for example how we are going to do the project in NEOM and so on in detail. But I think as the Board and the â all of the infrastructure funds and everybody sees that the demand is real and it is going â then you'd be able to finance these projects project finance these projects. And therefore I think we will â we certainly at Air Products are confident that we will be able to keep up in terms of the capital with the demand. We don't think we will be capital constrained. And I think the rest of the industry, those who wish to play on this thing will participate. I think there is a lot of cash as you know better than I do a significant amount of cash available around the world, who is looking for investing in green projects. The issue is lack of projects or lack of credible projects. And that is why I think in time you will see that the sum of our projects been we want to finance them there will be a lot of demand for people to project finance them. So I don't expect at least speaking for Air Products, I cannot speak for the industry. But the organ for Air Products, I don't think we will have the problem of lack of cash.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you for that and congratulations to you Simon. It's been a pleasure.
Simon Moore: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. There's an inflation reduction bill before the Congress. And previously there was a Q45 tax credit which I think was really $50 a tonne for sequestering carbon dioxide. And they're proposing in the current draft that it's $85 a tonne, so maybe up $35 a tonne. So by my calculation maybe that would increase your tax credit by $175 million. That is -- would take it from about $250 million a year to $425 million that you would receive over -- annually over a 10-year period. Does that math make sense to you?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, overall that may make sense and actually that math if you take the $25 and the $35 that applies to significantly more than the $5.5 million that you're talking about for the mega project because we also have a lot of CO2 in other places. Jeff, the bill that is in front of Congress is about 750 pages. I do not want to claim that I know that everything that is in all the 750 pages, but we have been involved significantly in the details of that bill. But the bill is not passed yet. So it will be premature to comment on it. Once the bill becomes law, I promise you that we will have a conference call and be as Air Products will delineate for you all of the aspects of that bill that would affect our business because it's not just only the CO2 there are things in there about hydrogen and other things. So I'd just like to wait. We know a lot about that bill, but I'd like to wait until the bill becomes law the President signs it hopefully in the next few weeks. And then, we will as I said, I promise you we will have a detailed conference call, where we will delineate the effect of that across our business.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you for that.
Seifi Ghasemi: Are you okay?
Jeff Zekauskas: Well, in terms of the -- yeah thanks for that and in terms of the amount of CO2 you can sequester, so if it's if that project is five million tonnes a year for 20 years that would be 100 million tonnes. And then, in the answer to my previous question you said you could put other carbon dioxide down that shaft. How big is the well? Is it 100 million tonnes, 200 million tonnes, can you roughly size how much carbon dioxide you'll be able to sequester or what your design idea is?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that is a little bit of a secret that we have, but order of magnitude let me tell you that the agreement that we have with the State of Louisiana allows us to put in and store significantly higher CO2 than the 100 million that you quote significantly high.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great.
Seifi Ghasemi: I don't want to give the exact number, because we are under confidentiality but it is significantly higher than the 100.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, good. Thank you very much.
Samir Serhan: Thank you Jeff.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys.
Samir Serhan: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: First question, I was hoping you can provide us just additional thoughts around how you're seeing business trends in China and Europe as we go into the fiscal fourth quarter.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, in China I think as we mentioned before, the impact of the COVID shutdowns we were able to deal with that and actually with all of the rest of our business growing, the effect was not that material. In terms of what is going to happen in the fourth quarter, it all depends on what would be the Chinese government's reaction to any additional outbreak of COVID and how many massive shutdowns they implement or they would not implement. So I cannot predict that, but we are prepared for that. We understand what that involves. And obviously we have taken some of that into consideration in terms of our guidance but that is totally unpredictable in terms of what will happen. Otherwise China's -- our business in China has been doing fine, especially the major customers that we have are running very well. Some of the coal gasification projects are running at full capacity because of the price of oil. So overall as I said except for the unknown in terms of dealing with COVID, otherwise it seems to be fine in terms of China. In terms of Europe, energy costs are obviously showing but much to our surprise, the economy has not suddenly tank. The economy is still our volumes have not significantly dropped, which is a little bit of a surprise. It can as we go forward, but we are optimistic that that will continue to be the case. Is that enough color? 
Mike Leithead: That's perfect. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. And Simon we're going to try to disrupt your retirement plans. We're not quite ready for that. But wanted to drill in a little bit about the climate bill that Jeff mentioned if that biz goes through, do you think that it would encourage you to implement more CO2 capture from all your existing SMRs in your Gulf Coast pipeline?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is exactly what did happen. Yes. If the bill getting enacted in the phone that it is being talked about right now -- until it becomes off.
Steve Byrne: Okay, understood. And then just one about Asia. Seifi you mentioned higher costs in Asia affecting the margin. But essentially no pass-through, energy pass-through and that 60% of your Asia business is on-site and pipeline. Is that just reflecting a reliance on coal-based energy? And so you don't -- you haven't seen much of an increase in that -- in your cost? 
Seifi Ghasemi: In China, electricity cost has not been a major factor. And in China about 69% of our business is on site. So up to now energy cost, electricity cost in China has not been a major factor for us. And obviously, that is regulated by the government. A little bit more control there.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Josh Spector from UBS. Please go ahead.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I guess, just a bit of a nitpick on the guide. You left the range wider than you normally do. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. But just curious based on current business conditions, are you tracking towards the midpoint of that guide at this point, or are you assuming some worsening kind of response to your prior comment around Europe and China? Just curious what gets you to the midpoint versus the higher low end here?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we kept -- you are very right. We usually have a tighter range as theyâve been get to this stage more like $0.10, but we kept it at $0.20, because of the uncertainty that we are facing, because we cannot obviously predict the future. But obviously, our goal is to at least get to the midpoint. That is our goal. But we just didn't want to pretend as if we know more than we do. And we do have the uncertainty in terms of what is going to happen not only in China, but also in Europe energy costs, what will happen to the supply of natural gas is Russia going to squeeze natural gas supply to Europe so that they cannot store it for the winter. I don't know. Some of those things are very big end loans. And also the US economy, the US economy nobody talks about it, but they just increased interest rates what effect is that going to have on consumer spending or are we going to see a contraction. We did see the GDP slowdown. So all of those are unknowns and that is why we kept the range. But obviously, our goal is to at least get to the midpoint at this stage. But we just wanted to make sure, we are very don't pretend as if we know more than we do. 
Josh Spector: Okay. Thanks. And if I could just ask a longer-term one, I guess, just on your base project backlog. Curious if you could provide any visibility and if that's higher or lower versus normal, we have a lot of visibility in your mega projects, but the base little less so. You announced that it sounds like a larger project in India. So curious kind of what your outlook is over the next year or two? Is that above average, below average? Where is that on the scale? Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: On the large projects and so on, we are very optimistic. And I think it will be will be developing and announcing a lot of new projects, because we are in a good position. We have technologies that people need, and we are focused on the right sector in terms of green and blue hydrogen. So you -- on gasification. So I think you'll hear a lot from us in the years to come. 
Josh Spector: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. 
John McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations Simon, well deserved. So Seifi, there's a lot of interest or growing interest on the LNG area and you have a really strong platform there. I guess can you help us to understand what the current kind of EBITDA run rate is for that business? And where do you think it could go? Like what's the maximum level just based on your capacity your flexibility around your manufacturing process that how big could that number get if LNG materializes the way some bulls in the energy market are actually thinking it will? 
Seifi Ghasemi: John, Dr. Serhan in his comments mentioned that we are seeing a lot of inquiries about our LNG business. What I can tell you is that, historically the peak performance of that business was approximately $200 million a year of contribution in EBITDA. Today it is -- I don't want to quote the exact number, but it is obviously not there. So, and it is a lot lower than that. So, we expect that business to do better. We -- but it is in the context of the $4 billion of or $4.5 billion of Air Products EBITDA it's not going to double our EBITDA, but it is a good business. It is an excellent business and it could significantly increase its EBITDA contribution as we go forward. And we are looking forward to that. There is as you said there is a lot of interest and we are in a very, very good position. We have a very good management team there. And we have very good solar technology which is sought after by everybody.  Something like I think 85% of all of the major LNG facilities around the world use our technology. So that's all. On a day-to-day basis Dr. Serhan runs that business. Samir, if you want to make any additional comments? 
Samir Serhan: I think Seifi you've covered it. I mean solid projects, we are executing now with 60 projects. I mean in our manufacturing facility again a significant amount of opportunities now we're developing with our customers. Again, the high natural gas pricing is driving this. The energy challenges in Europe is, also driving this again we have added last year 60% capacity to our manufacturing in Florida, court manager  product. So we are very well positioned to really capture that business and build up on the momentum. 
John McNulty: Got it. And thanks for the color. Appreciate it. And then Seifi you have a really big project backlog at this point. There's been a lot of inflationary pressures whether it's labor or different commodities and some are starting to come off some are continuing to push higher. Can you help us to understand the inflationary impact on the capital that you're putting to work on the projects in the backlog and how we should be thinking about that? 
Seifi Ghasemi: So John, there is obviously no question that there is inflation and that inflation will impact the capital cost of some of the projects that we are doing. The point that we are making is that with a significant amount of the capital that we are putting in the ground. We have not committed to the price of product out of those facilities, especially, our blue hydrogen and green hydrogen projects. Therefore, in case inflation drives up the capital that automatically means that product out of those plants will be more expensive than we sell it. And therefore it -- so I'm not worried about losing the margins that we expected on those projects which is most of our investments. Then there is a significant amount of our projects are almost at the end. I mean, Jazan Phase 2 is fixed price because we are purchasing something we are not building. That is a significant amount of money that we are going to deploy and then projects like Gulf Coast Ammonia and some of the other projects are almost done. So what we are left is we have quoted a number publicly I think that approximately $3 billion of our projects are projects that we already have a fixed price contract with our customers. So if you take that $3 billion and you say that well inflation is going to cost you 10%. Yes, we might have to spend $300 million more on those projects and going by the rule of tonne that would be an effect on our bottom-line of about $30 million in terms of operating income. So that can happen. Obviously, the team at Air Products is very, very focused to minimize the effect of inflation. And also to go back to some of those customers and try to increase the price to get any compensation for that but that is order of magnitude the extent of our exposure John. 
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color, Seifi. Appreciate it.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: As there are no further questions in the queue, I would like to turn the call back to Seifi for any additional or closing remarks. 
Seifi Ghasemi: Well,thank you very much. I would like to thank everyone of you for listening to our presentation. And also thank you very much for your good questions. I would like to once again thank Simon for his outstanding contribution. And wish him well. He is obviously going to be with us for a few more calls as we go forward. And we look forward to talking to you sometime at the end of October or early November when we announce our results. And in the meantime have a safe, healthy and enjoyable summer. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-05-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products’ Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today’s call is Mr. Simon Moore. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products’ second quarter 2022 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2. In addition, throughout today’s discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I want to begin by saying a few words regarding Air Products’ response to the current situation in Eastern Europe. We are deeply concerned by the human tragedy in Ukraine and the impact that this conflict has on the world. We condemn this aggression and encourage all efforts for peace. Our hearts go out to those affected and we are continuing to support our employees in this region. As a company, we are providing humanitarian support, including assistance to the International Committee of the Red Cross from the Air Products Fund Foundation. Our employees have also responded with care and generosity, reaching out to their affected colleagues and making contributions to various organizations supporting relief efforts. Our presence in Ukraine is minimum with about $5 million in sales last fiscal year and we have suspended the development of a small air separation unit in the country. Our business in Russia is also very small, with less than $25 million in sales last fiscal year. We are in the process of exiting Russia and will stop doing business in that country. Now, before we get into the details, I want to thank each and every one about 20,000 employees around the world for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and to serving our customers. Last quarter, despite the very difficult conditions caused by war, significant inflation in energy costs, supply chain disruptions and lingering effects of the COVID-19 virus, our people delivered strong results with an earnings per share of $2.38, which is 14% higher than the previous year. As always, our people’s commitment and dedication is our competitive advantage as we move forward. Now, please look at Slide #3, focusing on safety, which is our highest priority. Our second quarter safety performance was similar to last quarter, but still behind last year. Although we are proud of the fact that we have made significant progress in this area over the past few years, this result is not acceptable. Our goal remains zero accidents and zero incidents and we are committed to achieving that goal across the organization. Slides #4 to #7 include our goal, our management philosophy and our five plans for moving forward. And we have also included our higher purpose slide to explain what we are trying to do everyday when we come to work. We have shared these slides with investors many times before, but we always have them as part of our package to emphasize the point that these are the principles that we will follow everyday and they will continue to guide us as we move forward. As we have explained to our investors in the past, our strategy for moving forward is based on two pillars. The first is absolute excellence in running our existing industrial gases business. That is to operate with the greatest efficiency and productivity, invest and maintain our market share, and improve pricing to compensate for inflation. Our results that we have just announced confirm that we are successfully implementing this strategy, since we are delivering strong results under very difficult and challenging circumstances. The second pillar of our strategy for the future is to take advantage of our unique technologies and expertise to be a meaningful player in the significant worldwide effort to transition to clean energy. Specifically in this area, we are focused on developing and executing mega projects to produce bloom and green hydrogen and other sustainable fuels for the world. In summary, this explains the content of the almost $20 billion of projects that we have in our backlog and there are more of these projects to come. In the second quarter of fiscal year ‘22, we announced projects that confirm in a significant way our commitment to these two strategic pillars. First, in our base business, as you can see on Slide #8, we announced $1.3 billion of investment in two major projects for the electronic industry. These are real mega projects with long-term take-or-pay contracts with some of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in the world. We are proud to be executing these projects that confirm our significant position in the semiconductor industry. As related to the second pillar of our strategy, as you can see on the Slide #9, we announced that we are building a $2 billion facility in Southern California to convert a conventional refinery to one that produces sustainable aviation fuel called SAF. This facility will use as its raw material renewed organic material such as base cooking oil, animal fats, etcetera and use substantial amount of hydrogen to convert these raw materials to fuel for airplanes. The total capacity of this plant will be approximately 340 million gallons per year. Although this sounds like a big number, in 2019, world jet fuel consumption was more than 100 billion gallons. The world airlines are looking to decarbonize. Major corporations in the world are focused on reducing the carbon emissions generated by their airline business travel. And there are already significant incentives in place to encourage the move towards sustainable aviation fuel. This is the fundamental reason aligned with our strategy to pursue this opportunity. We started developing this project 3 years ago in partnership with World Energy, a private company that is currently the leading producer of sustainable airlines yield. Our agreement is that Air Products will engineer, build and own the facility and World Energy will provide the raw material. World Energy will also sell the project – the product and has a contractual commitment to pay Air Products at fixed fee that ensures an acceptable return on Air Products investment. We are very excited about these projects since it also uses a significant amount of hydrogen that we can supply from our established and extensive hydrogen pipeline in Southern California. Our partner in this project, World Energy, is a private company. So I know and fully appreciate that there is little information available about them in the public domain. We have permission from the principles of the company to disclose the following information, which can be found on Slide #10. This information is self-explanatory and we are delighted to work with World Energy on this great project. I’d just like to point out that on the bottom of Slide #10 we have included sales and profitability numbers, $400 million sales and $54 million of profit. That is just for the products that World Energy sells out of the Paramount refinery that we are converting today. In addition to that, World Energy has the capacity in their other plants in America and Canada to produce 150 million gallons a year of bio-diesel. The sales number and profitability of those numbers are not disclosed. I also want to report to you at this time that we continue to make good progress in building and bringing on stream key mega projects that we have already announced. Slide #11 highlights the major projects that we expect to bring on stream in 2023. Now, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our performance over the past 8 years. In July 2014, during my first conference call with investors as Chairman, President and CEO of Air Products, I promised the shareholders that our goal was to deliver over the long-term a 10% per year average cumulative growth in Air Products earnings per share. On Slide 12, you can see that for the past 8 years, we have delivered more than what we promised 8 years ago. And our goal for the future is to continue to deliver similar results as we move forward. On Slide 13, you can see that we have shared the positive growth with our investors and increase our dividend on average 10% per year over the last 8 years. And finally, please turn to Slide #14, still my favorite slide. It shows our EBITDA margin since 2014. Despite all of the turmoil in the board, significant energy, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions, our EBITDA margin last quarter was almost 1,000 basis points higher than in 2014. Now, it’s my pleasure to turn the call over to Melissa to discuss our results in more details. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, we are executing our growth strategy and supporting our base business at the same time. We expect the large projects to drive our long-term growth, while our base business continues delivering near-term results. Both large projects and base businesses contribute to our fiscal second quarter results. The Jazan joint venture that started up during Q1 provided a full quarter of benefit, consistent with our commitment of $0.80 to $0.85 per share on a full year basis. Our pricing actions also contributed with gains exceeding variable cost increases this quarter. The outperformance was particularly noteworthy in Europe, where we experienced the most significant energy cost pressure. I want to express my thanks to the team for their speed of execution and a job well done. Now, please turn to Slide 15 for our second quarter results. Energy costs remained elevated this quarter. And our teams continue to implement significant price actions in response to the unprecedented search. The 6% total company price increase translating 13% increases in price for the merchant business. This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit price gain across our merchant business. Volume was also strong, increasing 8% overall, up in all segments, driven by the new assets, hydrogen recovery, strong merchant demand and increased sales of equipment activity. Pricing volume combined, were up 14%, accounting for most of the 18% sales increase compared to last year. EBITDA increased 9%, our third consecutive quarter exceeding the $1 billion mark as favorable volume, prices and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 270 basis points from the prior year as the negative impact of higher costs in energy pass-through more than offset higher equity affiliate income. Higher energy pass-through lowered margins by about 200 basis points. Sequentially, volumes were down 3% primarily due to lower higher volumes on specific customer operational actions and the leaner . Operating income was up 7%, driven by favorable rates and costs. However, EBITDA was up 2% and net income was down 5%, primarily due to the  related to the finalization of our previous Jazan-ASU joint venture, which was the benefit last quarter. ROCE was 10.6%. We currently have significant cash on our balance sheet, which will support the major projects we have announced. Adjusting for this cash, our ROCE would have been 13.7%. We expect ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash in the current environment on stream. Now, please turn to Slide 16. Our second quarter adjusted EPS was $2.38, which is $0.30 or 14% above last year, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digital year-over-year revenue growth and a testament to the stability, resilience and growth of our business model. Volume was favorable at $0.18 and price net of variable cost was $0.14 as our price actions more than offset the unprecedented energy cost increases. For the quarter, our price actions alone before netting against variable cost contributed around $0.50. Our other costs are higher due to the combination of investment for future growth, planned maintenance and external factors. One example that we have invested in is our helium storage caverns to help provide reliable helium supply to our customers globally. This investment increased our cost now, but we expect to generate significant value from this investment in the future. We also see higher cost as we increased resources prior to bringing projects on stream. For example, we have hired approximately  people, who will be responsible for operating the GTL gasifier complex once it comes on stream next year. These purposeful strategic actions begin to ensure the long-term success of our company or responsible for roughly half the total increased cost this quarter. The remaining half was primarily external factors attributable to inflation and supply chain challenges across the region. We remain focused on driving productivity across our business. The Jazan joint venture contributed its first full quarter of results and continues to deliver as expected. Our share of the results from the projects, are reflected entirely in equity affiliate income this quarter and will be going forward. I realized this is an updated accounting interpretation and it’s slightly different than we discussed last quarter, but we believe this approach will be clearer for our investors moving forward. There is no difference to the bottom line EPS. The project continues to deliver as we expected. Overall, for the quarter, equity affiliate income was $0.18 higher driven by our share of the joint ventures profit. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 18.6% was 160 basis points lower than last year, including the favorable impact to Jazan. We expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 20% for the remainder of this fiscal year. Non-operating income is $0.03 lower driven by higher pension expense. Now please turn to Slide 17. The stability of our business continues to allow us to generate strong cash flow despite the challenging geopolitical and energy environment. Over the last 12 months, we generated around $2.8 billion of distributable cash flow or nearly $12.70 per share from our EBITDA of over $4 million in interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures. Note that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual driven from higher spending on our new global , which is nearly complete. From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.3 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.5 billion available for high returns level. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. Slide 18 provides an update on our capital deployment. We continue to make great progress in developing, announcing and executing on our major growth markets. In fact, we see potential opportunities significantly greater than the investment assay we show here. As you can see, our capital deployment potential is over $34 billion for fiscal 2027. $34 billion includes about $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, over $16 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $10 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which would generate additional cash flow and additional filing of taxes. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted . So you can see we have already said 29% in our already committed 74% of the updated capacity we show here. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remain in business in the high return project. We continually evaluate our levels  and determine the best way to use available cash entrusted to us by our shareholders. We believe that investing in these high-return projects is the best way to create shareholder value in the long run. To begin the review of our business segment results, I will turn the call back over to Seifi. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide #19 for our Asia results. Sales were up 8% compared to last year, primarily on 6% higher volume as a variety of new traditional industrial gas plants came on stream across this region. Price was again positive. The 1% overall price improvement for the region equals to about a 3% increase for the merchant business. China’s dual control policy has eased, but COVID restrictions in parts of China have modestly impacted customer demand. They also impacted our plant efficiency and increased our supply chain costs.  Costs that are unfavorable and favorable, primarily due to inflation and resources needed to support new project start-ups, as Melissa mentioned. EBITDA was up 2% as better volume and price more than offset higher costs. Compared to last quarter, volumes declined 2% primarily due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Price was 2% lower sequentially. As mentioned during our last earnings call, China’s government has relaxed its power tariff program to allow local power costs to fluctuate. This market-oriented approach has resulted in higher power costs compared to last quarter. However, our overall costs were lower due to better operating and supply chain efficiencies. Our EBITDA was down 9% sequentially, and EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points as the unfavorable volume and price more than offset lower costs. For the second half of the fiscal year, we are very concerned about the potential impact of the COVID-related restrictions in China, and we do expect higher planned maintenance activities. Now I would like to turn the call over to Simon to talk about the European results. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 20. Energy costs in Europe began the quarter moderating but then moved up significantly and were the highest yet in March. Natural gas costs peaked in January more than 7x higher than a year ago while power costs stayed almost 4x higher. As Melissa mentioned, our on-site business has contractual pass-through of the higher costs, so we are not directly impacted by higher natural gas prices. Higher power costs are also passed through in our ASU on-site business. In our merchant business, our team implemented significant price actions, which more than covered the higher power costs this quarter. In fact, we recovered this quarter’s higher our costs and about half of the unrecovered costs from Q1. Again, a great job by the team. However, we remain vigilant and are working to drive further improvement. Now please turn to Slide 21 for a review of our Europe results. Compared to the prior year, sales were up 32%. Energy cost pass-through, which increases sales but not profits accounted for more than two-thirds of the sales increase. Price increased 14% for the region, which translates to 22% for the merchant business. Prices were higher across all major product lines and separate agents. Volume was up 2% on higher merchant volumes. EBITDA was down 3% as favorable price net of variable costs and better equity affiliate income were more than offset by negative currency, unfavorable volume mix and higher other costs. For the quarter, the supply chain disruptions caused by the significant energy cost increases persistent, negatively impacting both plants operating and distribution efficiencies. We also saw higher costs due to inflation while we continue to prepare for new projects coming on stream. EBITDA margin was 950 basis points lower, most of the decline about 700 basis points was due to the significant energy pass-through increase. The remainder was mostly driven by higher costs and negative volume mix, partially offset by strong merchant pricing and higher equity income. Compared to the prior quarter, price was up 5%, further improved from the already strong performance last quarter, which allowed us to more than offset the higher energy costs. This equates to an 8% increase on the merchant business. Volume was 7% lower due to reduced hydrogen demand on customer-specific operating actions. EBITDA jumped 17% sequentially, and EBITDA margin improved 380 basis points as strong price higher equity affiliate income and lower non-energy-related costs more than compensated for the lower volume. Now I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a brief discussion of our other segments.
Samir Serhan: Thank you, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 22 for a review of our Americas results. Sales increased 12% versus last year. Volume and price together were up 11%. Our team in the Americas also did an excellent job raising prices to cover the higher energy costs this quarter. Prices improved in all key product lines over the last year and were also up sequentially. The 5% price gain for the region compared to last year is equivalent to a 12% increase in our merchant business. Price, net of variable costs was also positive for the region. Volume grew 6%, primarily due to hydrogen recovery and better merchant demands. In general, we see hydrogen demand pre-COVID levels. Although hydro volumes this quarter were impacted by the planned outages. We expect the third quarter to continue at a high level of planned outages then expect volume to fully recover as we move into 2023. Meanwhile, our merchant volume was weaker in South America due to lower demand for medical oxygen as COVID cases declined. The decreased demand for medical gases also reduced Americas equity affiliate income. As we expected, the planned maintenance increased costs this quarter. Costs were also unfavorable primarily due to inflation and supply chain-related challenges, including driver shortages that are broadly impacting the industry. Operating income improved as positive price and volume more than covered unfavorable mix and higher costs. EBITDA was flat as it was impacted by lower equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin was 460 basis points lower than the previous year due to higher costs, negative volume mix and reduced equity affiliate income, which were partially offset by better price. Sequentially, volume this quarter was lower due to planned maintenance outages. Operating income was up primarily due to strong price but was partially offset by higher maintenance costs. EBITDA was down additionally impacted by lower equity affiliate income. Now please turn to Slide 23, our Middle East and India segment, which includes our businesses in the Middle East, including the Jazan joint venture in India. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly owned operations are smaller in size. However, the segment’s EBITDA significantly includes stake with the affiliate income related to the Jazan joint venture and our India joint venture, NAX AB. The $55 million increase in equity affiliate income included our share of the Jazan joint venture net profit for the full quarter that Melissa previously discussed. I’m pleased to report that the team successfully started up a number of gasifier and steam carbon units, and the rest of the Phase 1 start-up is continuing as planned. Sequentially, equity affiliate income was lower due to the positive non-recurring items in quarter one related to the finalization of our previous Jazan ASU joint ventures. Now please turn to Slide 24, which addresses our corporate segment. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Over the past few years, our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses have grown considerably and are now reasonably – responsible for most of the sales and the profit increases this quarter. Our LNG project activities remained robust and also contributed to these increases. As expected, inquiries for potential LNG projects have increased significantly. But since our customers’ major projects take time to develop, it will be some time until this interest translates into new projects. At this point, I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing comments. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Although the consequences of the conflict in Ukraine are far from clear, the evolving situation has once again brought the critical issue of energy independence and national security to the forefront, emphasizing the critical nature of the energy transition, their air products has highly valued technologies, skills and experience that will benefit our customers and countries around the world. Gasification allows countries to utilize their own resources in an environmentally friendly way, reducing their imports of fuel and chemicals. Meanwhile, renewable energy, including green hydrogen and fuse drive from sustainable organic resources, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, will allow countries to reduce their reliance on faster fuels. Furthermore, the desire for diversified energy supply will also encourage additional LNG projects in the future, a positive development for Air Products as we are the leading technology and equipment provider for these large LNG projects. Air Products’ strategy and competencies are allowing us to be a leader in the energy transition. Our industry-leading gasification technologies are suitable for various types of feeder stocks, which can create net-zero hydrogen. The NEOM Green Hydrogen project is the largest project of its kind in the world. Our LNG heat exchanges, which convert natural gas to liquid are an integral part to all LNG projects. The sustainable aviation fuel to be produced in our new facility in California is a direct drop in replacement for conventional jet fuel. It can significantly reduce carbon footprint of the aviation industry without any equipment modification. The focus on energy security and energy transition is creating significant new project opportunities now and in the future. Therefore, we firmly believe that investing in high-return projects rather than share buyback is the right way forward to support the energy transition and continued profitable growth for Air Products and an appropriate return for our investors. Now please turn to Slide #25. I remain highly confident of Air Products’ resilient business model, our strategy and our execution. However, I do have some concerns about the economic backdrop, driven by continued COVID challenges, the impact of supply chain constraints, inflation and energy costs. Even with these challenges, for quarter three fiscal year 2022, our opening per share guidance is $2.55 to $2.65, up 10% to 15% over last year and almost $0.20 higher than last quarter. For fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $10.20 to $10.40, which is 13% to 15% better than last year. We continue to see our CapEx in ‘22 to be around $4.5 billion to $5 billion, including the approximately $1.5 billion previously invested for Phase 1 of the Jazan project. At this point, I’d like you to turn to Slide #26. The drive for energy security and transition to a more sustainable future are not mutually exclusive. The world needs cleaner, lower carbon forms of energy and more divest sources of energy. We believe our strategy directly addresses these needs. As we drive toward the clean energy world, the talent and dedication of our people are the key to making this vision a reality. We need, unfortunately, have talented and dedicated people to help us accelerate the progress. As I always say, our long-term competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of our people. Their hard work and contribution will ensure our success. So at this point, I would like to end my comments, and we will be very delighted to answer questions. Operator, we are ready for questions.
Operator: Thank you.  Our first question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, Seifi, how are you? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, good, Vincent. Great to hear from you.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, thank you. I’m wondering if you could just talk a little bit more to start off with about the volume decline in Europe and how much of that was related to sort of customer financial conditions versus maintenance or anything else and sort of how you’re seeing the European operating environment in general, just given obviously the inflation for the consumer and for corporates and some of the other macro challenges?
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Our volume decline in Europe in our  business but specifically related to one specific customer who decided to kind of change the feedstock for their gasifiers because of the high natural gas prices. But overall, we do see a small decline. I think we said that our volumes in Europe sequentially are down about 2%. That is obviously the effect of the very high energy prices. And there were those high energy prices is affecting demand. But it is not dramatic and it is not a significant cause of concern, but it is a cause of – but it is a reality that we have to deal.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up, the other costs that you called out from the investments, obviously, easy to understand what you’re doing there. But could you help us understand whether those costs have now sort of plateaued on a sort of year-over-year basis, such that we will begin to lap them and they won’t be come in incremental issue? Or do you think there is going to be more investment coming in future quarters?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, obviously,  our costs every penny. But that cost increases, for example, in Europe are related to the fact that we are building the infrastructure that we need to build in order to bring our green ammonia into Europe, crack it and supply green energy to Europe. So it is early days but we have started that process. And that requires people and the expenditure and buying properties and renting equipment and trying to do engineering and all of that, because that is – they need to get ready because by 2026, ‘27, they need to bring in the green ammonia and sell it to our customers, and the customers expect us to start building the infrastructure. And then around the world, we are starting up new plants and all of that. So those costs are very focused and necessary for us to maintain the growth. We’ve been software related it, as you see right now, our costs are a little bit higher than they should be. But in the overall scheme of things, they would be more than justified as we move forward. But I don’t expect to see a significant uptick on those costs, if that is where you are going Vincent.
Vincent Andrews: That’s exactly what I wanted to know. Thank you very much Seifi. I will pass it on.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Cory Murphy: This is Cory on for Kevin. In the context of Asia, why has the pricing in Asia lagged? And can you help us understand maybe the pricing in the region? And then for the volume, it declined modestly on a sequential basis. How much of that was related to Lunar New Year versus COVID? And have you seen any impact thus far in the current quarter as it relates to COVID impact on volume?
Seifi Ghasemi: Fine. With respect to pricing, the reason that the prices haven’t gone up so much in Asia is because there is no significant energy inflation in Asia that justifies us going to the customers and increasing prices. So that is the fundamental dynamics. The decrease in volumes are mainly due to Lunar New Year. But starting in March, the restrictions that the Chinese government has put in clients on are beginning to have some effect. And as we are in this current quarter, we do see more impact because of the COVID restrictions. It is almost impossible to predict what would be the effect because it depends on how much they relaxed restrictions or actually increased it depending on the progress of COVID. So we are watching that situation very carefully because it can swing back and forth in a significant way.
Cory Murphy: Understood.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, Cory?
Cory Murphy: Yes, that’s great and a quick follow-up. In the context of rising interest rates, I’m curious how you think about capital deployment going forward and the need for potentially higher ROIC on future projects? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Rising interest rates, if we need to raise new capital, obviously, we have to pay more interest on that. But right now, currently, we have a lot of cash, and we are not in the market to do that. Was that your point or did I miss that?
Cory Murphy: I guess I meant more broadly, sort of structurally as you think about the 10% returns that you generally target, would you raise that target and how would you think about the project you take on? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: No, but now that I understand your question completely, of course, we do. I mean, if we are going to bid on a new project or consider a new project, we will consider it in the view of bodies across our capital. Obviously, the cost of capital has gone up as interest goes up.
Cory Murphy: Okay, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Anthony  on for Dave Begleiter. Would you expect earnings in Europe to be up year-over-year in the second half? And then in regards to Asia, do you think merchant pricing is slowing there? It was up just, I believe, 3% year-over-year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think, first of all, if I may ask your second question first. Merchant pricing in the second half in Asia depends very much on what the energy costs are and all of that. If we see energy costs going up, that our costs are going up, we certainly will increase the prices to recover that, and I hope that our performance in the last two quarters demonstrates that we do have the ability to increase prices if energy costs go up. As Melissa mentioned, we have increased prices in Europe, 22% versus last year, significant pricing power when it is justified. So, we will do that. As far as whether our earnings in the second half of the year, for Europe will be higher than before, I don’t want to make a forward predictions like that. But from the guidance that we have given you for the quarter and for the year, you can conclude that we are not expecting any decline. We expect that we will do fine versus last year. That’s why – that’s the only way we can meet our forecast.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. And yes, just maybe as one more follow-up here. Is the entire increase in the Middle East and India equity income of – I think it was $55 million. Is it all from Jazan?
Seifi Ghasemi: Most of it is from Jazan, our joint venture operations in India is doing very well, too. But most of that is from Jazan. Dr. Serhan, do you want to make any comment on that?
Samir Serhan: Yes. Definitely, Jazan is the main driver for the results in the second quarter. But again, when it comes to our joint venture, 50-50 INOX AP in India, that’s also doing very well. We are currently basically executing around 20 new plants for India. They are basically the number one industrial gas company in India, and they are on a significant growth. So, we anticipate in the future that we are going to get more contribution from that.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Leithead of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Mike Leithead: First I wanted to ask on your Slide 11 on the 2023 projects, I appreciate we are still a bit early in ‘22, but I think you have got over $2 billion of projects starting up there. So, could you maybe just help level set roughly how we should think about the EPS contribution in ‘23? I know Jazan should be immediately accretive upon close, other projects might need to ramp, just roughly how we should net that all together here?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think we have laid it out for you because we say that every dollar that we spend should get us $0.10 in operating income. And then you know our tax rate and all of that. So, the projects that we have, we have given you the capital, not – all of them are not going to come on stream at the beginning of ‘23, but you can make a good guess about how much contribution those projects will make to our bottom line and it is not small.
Mike Leithead: Okay. Great. And then maybe just secondly, on the SAF projects, I think there has obviously been tremendous customer interest for sustainable aviation fuel, as you rightly talk about. But my understanding is there is still some questions in the industry about constraints on feedstock and what that ultimately means for SAF pricing and the economics behind it. So, obviously, you are investing and backing a company growing very tremendously from, say, $4 million SAF to $250 million. So, I guess just how do you get comfortable with the questions of feedstock supply and the economics behind that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, because we have confidence in both energy people who have been, they are responsible for coming up with feedstock. They have been in the business of buying and providing the feedstock or the facilities for the past 20 years. That company has been around since 1999. We are very confident people and we have done our due diligence, and they feel very confident that they can get the feedstock. Everybody in the world is trying to do this thing, as you know, that’s why a company like Chevron then bought REG and all of that. Everybody is trying to convert their refineries to sustainable airline fuel because that is the fuel of the future. The great thing about sustainable aviation fuel is the fact that it’s a direct dropping. You don’t need to change the engine of the plane or anything like that. Obviously, we believe that 50 years from now, most of these planes, especially the short-haul ones will be fueled by hydrogen. But I think that in the meantime, right now, sustainable airline fuel is – SAF is the solution and everybody wants it, not only the airlines, but also companies, some of the biggest companies in the world that they want to take credit for decarbonizing their business travel. So, the demand is very high on that. We are very excited about that project.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Mike Harrison at Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning Mike. How are you?
Mike Harrison: Doing well. Thanks Seifi. You noted the increases that you have seen in LNG inquiries, obviously, given the natural gas situation in Europe, can you give us a sense of how many of these inquiries could turn into equipment sales? And I guess, maybe how should we think about the contribution of LNG heat exchangers as we think about the next couple of years?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I am going to turn this question to Dr. Serhan to answer because he runs the business on a day-to-day basis. But obviously, we are not going to disclose the contribution of these projects. But Dr. Serhan mentioned that they are seeing significant additional inquiries. But I will let him make the comment. Dr. Serhan, would you like to…
Samir Serhan: Yes. Thanks Seifi. Yes. We are currently executing seven large word scale of projects right now, they are under execution. Everything is going well. And actually, and we are getting lots of pressure from our customers to supply this exchange earlier because of the demand for LNG. And I can tell you, our pipeline right now for projects is more than 15 projects that basically we are developing with our customers, and we see this is going to be coming in the future. So, we do expect very steady flow and income out of our LNG business. It’s really in a very good position.
Mike Harrison: Okay. Alright. And that’s great. And then I wanted to ask a question about the helium business. Talk a little bit about what you are seeing in that market and how much contribution that’s having to both earnings and pricing? And maybe talk a little bit about what we should expect from the helium business in the second half compared to what you are seeing now? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Mike, our helium business, it’s a business that we don’t usually talk about the details of that, but – in terms of how much contribution and all of that. It’s a great business. We are the world leader on that. The fact of the matter is that the world expected that very large projects that will produce helium, called the Amur Project in Russia, would be on stream in 2021. And that would put a lot of helium in the market. And therefore, it would have a negative price – negative effect on pricing. That was the expectation. In starting up those plants in Russia, they had one explosion in one train, and then six months later, they had an explosion in the second train. So, nothing came – no helium came out of Russia in 2021, and nothing has come out of it in 2022 yet, but now, on top of the fact that they have to repair those units because of the damage that was done, now you have the issue of the sanctions on Russia. So, I am not sure that even when they are ready to bring that material to the market, how much of it can they bring on the market considering the sanctions. So, as a result of all of that, you would expect that the market for helium would be a little bit tight, and that is what we see. Okay?
Mike Harrison: Excellent. Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: We will move next to Josh Spector with UBS.
Josh Spector: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just first on the guidance. I guess looking at your guide for next quarter and the full year, you are implying about a 10%-ish step-up sequentially each of the next two quarters. Wondering if you could break down the drivers there between price cost recovery, volume or anything else, particularly in light of perhaps more challenging volume outlook than you guys expected previously?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I am very happy that you laid it out like that because it does show that it is a pretty robust forecast, so a 10% each quarter going up. The reason that we feel confident about that is that number one, historically, if you look at our results, we delivered about 47%, 48% of our EPS in the first half and 52%, 53% of our result in the second half. Seasonally, the second half is stronger. So, that is one reason. The second reason is that we are very confident about the fact that we can deal with inflation and energy cost increases by increasing prices. So, as a result and I hope the investors get some comfort about that looking at our results, that we have that capability. And I think that is one of the most important things that I hope people notice about our results, that we have the capacity and the ability to do that. And the only reason we can do that is because our products that our customers need and our products are not a significant part of our customers’ cost. So, with the increased prices, we are not increasing the final price of the product that the customer sells to the market that much. So, we have the ability to recover that. So, therefore – and then with the volumes, we are optimistic that at least – I don’t know what’s going to happen in Asia, but we are optimistic that at least in the U.S. and in Europe, we will see some pent-up demand because of – now that the COVID is easing out, and therefore, we will see better volumes.
Josh Spector: Okay. Thanks. That’s very helpful. And I guess just a second question, just on hydrogen logistics. I guess with the Neon project, you guys announced there is $2 billion of infrastructure to be spent along with that. With SAF, you talked about some infrastructure there. The Arizona plant, I think you had some language that it could be a hydrogen hub to an extent. And you announced the Rotterdam commercial truck hydrogen hub as well. Is that part of that $2 billion being spent in some of those projects, or is that contemplated for some different applications?
Seifi Ghasemi: The $2 billion is just related to Neon. The other things that you are talking about are additional costs to that $2 billion.
Josh Spector: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: We will go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Dan Rizzo: Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. Just want to think over time, what do you think is a good mix in terms of profit contribution from the vertically integrated JVs relative to on-site, merchant and packaged, how should we think about it over the long-term?
Seifi Ghasemi: May I just focus on your question to make sure that I understood it correctly?
Dan Rizzo: I just want to know how we should think about mix over the long-term from JVs, from on-site, from merchant and packages, how it should break out?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, our JVs right now, if you add up the sales of our JVs, I think we disclosed that publicly. Simon, we do disclose it publicly, so I can mention that, right?
Simon Moore: Correct.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Our sales from JVs is getting close to more than $2.5 billion. So, we see a very good growth in our JVs. Our major JVs are an excellent company that we had in Italy called Safilo . We have an outstanding company in India. And as Dr. Serhan mentioned, they are going very fast with 20 new plants under construction. And then we had a great JV in Thailand, and a significant joint venture in Mexico. Those four – and obviously, we have a JV in Taiwan that we fully consolidated. But these JVs, they are all very good companies, long established companies, and they are doing very well and because some of those economies are doing well. So, we expect those to continue to grow. And then our merchant business, right now, I think our on-site business is about 20 – about 52%, 53%, 55% of our portfolio. And we expect that with all of the big projects that we are doing, that we would end up our on-site business, if you look at it 10 years from now, it might grow to be about 60% – I mean 70% of our business. But that doesn’t mean that our merchant business is shrinking. Our merchant business should continue to grow. The percentage will come down because the whole company will become a much bigger company.
Dan Rizzo: That’s very helpful. I really appreciate that. And then just one follow-up, with the equity income, does it have the same seasonality as the rest of the company? I think you mentioned 52%, 48% for EPS. I was just wondering if the income from affiliates is relatively the same?
Seifi Ghasemi: I wouldn’t characterize it that way because those are different countries, different dynamics and all of that. But usually, the second half of the year is stronger for most people usual.
Dan Rizzo: Alright. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Next, John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes. Hi Seifi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess look, we understand the lockdowns in China are a little bit difficult to predict going forward. But I guess is there a way to think about how much April was down relative to, say, the first – or excuse me, your fiscal 2Q levels, just so we can kind of set a baseline and then think about how it kind of changes throughout the quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all good morning, John. John, if I start disclosing that since I know the results for the month of April, it’s kind of talking about the quarter while we are in the middle of it. But let me just in general say that April was a little bit worse than the month of March. Yes, let me put it that way. The situation compared to March hasn’t improved. I hope it does improve. But it’s totally unpredictable, John. I don’t think even the Chinese authorities know that in terms of – it just depends on the spread and number of cases of COVID, right.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. And then just a housekeeping kind of question. So, in Slide 16, where there was kind of a breakdown of the earnings contributions. You had about $0.18 from equity affiliate income. And I am assuming the bulk of that is Jazan. But when I annualize that, it doesn’t quite get to that kind of $0.80 to $0.85 contribution that Jazan is supposed to be giving. So, am I missing something on this, or does they have kind of another kind of step up when we think about moving from fiscal 2Q to fiscal 3Q that we should be thinking about or whether there is a start-up issue or what have you, like, I guess how would you characterize that?
Seifi Ghasemi: I will give Melissa to think about this thing before I turn it over to her to answer the specific question. But with respect to Jazan, there is no step-up. I mean what you saw in the second quarter is a pretty good – is a representation of what that will do every quarter until the Phase 2 comes on stream. So, now if you are taking the contribution that we have had and annualizing, they can say that where is the $0.88, I think we should get to that. I think Melissa mentioned that it will get to that. But Melissa, would you like to make any comments on this?
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. So, thank you, Seifi. Just to be clear, that $0.18 that you are saying there is versus prior year, right, So yes, you have to take the – that is a portion of the prior year. But to be clear, if you are analyzing the IGCC, it’s around $0.22 for this quarter. But we did have some headwinds in other joint ventures, specifically our Mexican joint venture has some headwind because of reduced sales from COVID lockdown medical oxygen.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Absolutely.
Operator: We will next to Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Kieran on for Chris.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi.
Unidentified Analyst: I was just wondering if you can speak a little bit about your current, let’s say, traditional on-site project backlog. You seem to be getting some benefits in Asia throughout this quarter. But how should we think about contributions from that business in the balance of the year and maybe into ‘23? And maybe more of a long-term picture, are you seeing an uptick in opportunities, I guess particularly in terms of energy or chemical or electronics end markets? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. We are doing very well in that regard. We are getting projects which are more than our so-called traditional share of the market. We are very successful in the electronic industry. As you saw on the projects that we have announced and there are some projects that we haven’t announced. And in the other things like oxygen plants and nitrogen generators and so on, we certainly are winning our share of the market. So, if you look at the industrial gases business worldwide and look at our market share, which is about, I think, 14%, 15%, 17% depending – you look at it, we certainly are winning more than that in terms of the so-called traditional hydrogen generator, oxygen generators and electronic high-purity nitrogen generators. We are doing fine there, and we are very pleased with that.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then maybe just a really quick follow-up in terms of the Americas logistics challenges. I think you mentioned trucking being a bit of a drag in terms of the quarter. Any thoughts in terms of that improving, whether it’s just preliminary thoughts into what you have seen throughout April and May, or just your thoughts into the back half of the year would be helpful. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. I mean our challenge in the United States is that you know that we are obviously a very big trucking company because we have all of these trucks developing – delivering product to our customers. I don’t mind telling you that we right now have had in the last quarter about 150 positions open for truck drivers that we cannot get. So, despite that, we are delivering product to our customers and so on. But you know what that means, that means that our costs increased. Number one, we have to offer a lot more to hire drivers. And number two, people have to work significant amounts of overtime in order to compensate for the shortage of the drivers that we have. So, that is creating an issue for us, but that has been with us in the last two quarters. And the effect of that on our bottom line is included in the second quarter. So, in the next few quarters, I don’t think the situation will get worse. But I think we owe it to describe what the challenges are.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: We will go next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open Steve. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Rob Hoffman for Steve Byrne. My first question is regarding the first SAF project, does World Energy have any long-term contracts for SAF? And if so, oil pricing needs to be competitive with conventional aviation fuel. And then will the hydrogen plant be a POX or ACR technology rather than an SMR so as to enable CO2 capture if required in the future?
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Number one, I will answer your second part of the question. The hydrogen plants that we have supplying this thing now when it comes on the screen, will be the regular SMRs. But in the future, we can put CO2 capture on those, but capturing CO2 in Southern California, you have a challenge of what do you do with it. Our plan in the long-term, in the long-term, is to try to supply that facility with green hydrogen, which we can bring to Los Angeles from our different plants making green hydrogen and use our pipeline to deliver that. So, that is how we would super de-carbonize. In terms of the price, competitive pricing, as you know, the new cell sustainable airline fuel to an airline, you charge them a certain amount, but then there is the incentives, the low LCFS, low carbon fuel subsidies that people get. So, theoretically you can sell me a gallon of sustainable aviation fuel for $5 or $6, which is the price that you pay for the conventional thing. But then one can get about $3 to $4 or sometimes more than that, depending on the carbon intensity as a subsidy, which is – it’s a tradable commodity right now. So, as a result, the end result will be as if you are selling it for $9 or $10 a gallon these days. So, that is going. Therefore, it is very competitive.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. A quick follow-up, just what was the source of hydrogen recovery in the Americas? And is there more opportunity for this?
Seifi Ghasemi: The source of hydrogen recovery is basically the fact that the refineries are running harder because the demand for gasoline has gone up.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. Thank you, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Yes.
Operator: And with no other questions holding, I will turn the conference back for any additional or closing comments.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much. I would like to take a moment and thank everybody for their participation in our call. We appreciate your good questions and we look forward to talking to you in about three months about our third quarter results. In the meantime, stay safe and have a wonderful day. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today’s call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-02-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Simon Moore. Please, go ahead. 
Simon Moore: Thank you, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2022 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate and ROCE both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Also as we shared with you on our last call, this is the first quarter we reported our results with our new Middle East and India and our new Corporate segments. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I am proud to say that despite significant challenges including unprecedented energy cost increases and I mean unprecedented, especially in Europe, supply chain disruptions and the continued adverse effects caused by the pandemic, the talented committed and motivated people of Air Products continued to deliver excellent results, including earnings per share this quarter in the top half of our guidance range. This quarter we closed on Phase 1 1of the Jazan project, which is the single largest project in our company's history and will create significant value for many years to come. As always, I want to thank our more than 20,000 employees around the globe for standing together, working hard, staying agile and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Let me start this presentation with our highest priority, which is obviously safety. Please take a look at slide number three. Although, we have made significant progress in this area since fiscal year 2014, our first quarter safety performance was slightly behind last year. That is not acceptable. Our goal remains zero accidents and zero incidents. And we are committed to drive towards that goal across the organization knowing that the right attitude and constant attention to safety is absolutely necessary and required. Slides number 4, 5 and 6 include our goal, our management philosophy and our Five Point Plan. We have shared these slides to you before so I'm not going to go through the details. But these are the principles that we follow every day and they will guide us in the future. Now please turn to Slide number 7. We are focused on making Air Products a leader in providing solutions to today's significant energy and environmental challenges through gasification cabin capture and clean hydrogen. I am proud to say that we have continued to create and win projects that help customers and countries meet their growing needs for cleaner energy and environmental solutions. Last year, we announced two landmark blue hydrogen projects, one in Alberta Canada and the other in Louisiana in United States of America adding to our a slate of broad scale mega projects supporting the energy transition. At the beginning of our fiscal year this fiscal year we successfully closed on Phase 1 of the $12 billion Jazan gasification and power project fulfilling one of our major commitments. We continue to expect Phase 1 of this project to contribute $0.80 to $0.85 per share on a full year basis consistent with what we have committed to you before. We also continue to make great progress on this -- our significant project backlog. Now please turn to Slide number 8. Creating a cleaner future requires experience investment and innovation on a broader scale. At Air Products we have the technology, the track record, the capital and the ambition to execute our bold strategy in bringing people around the world together to collaborate in an inclusive environment and help solve sustainability challenges. We are living our higher purpose as a company. That is our higher purpose. Now please turn to Slide number 9. It is clear that at Air Products sustainability is our growth strategy. Sustainability creates our growth opportunities and our growth opportunities supports our sustainability goals and focus. We are very proud to help drive the energy transition in particular through our world-scale hydrogen  project. Our new project in Saudi Arabia, Alberta project in Canada and Louisiana project in the United States of America represent almost $10 billion of direct Air Products capital to create a zero and low-carbon hydrogen needed to drive decarbonization and accelerate the energy transition. These projects will significantly reduce CO2 equivalent emissions for our customers, for Air Products itself and for the world. As a first mover, taking real action through these real projects, we can bring a portfolio of experiences and technologies together to provide lower carbon forms of energy, improve our customers' sustainability and help solve significant energy and environmental challenges. As I said, this is our higher purpose as a company. In addition, it is important that our commitments are aligned with our strategy. We introduced our Third by '30 carbon intensity reduction goal more than a year ago. And I'm very proud to say that the major projects we have announced along with our day-to-day focus on operational efficiency puts us in a great position to meet or exceed this goal by 2030. But as a company, we are never satisfied with our current performance. Therefore, we are taking another look at our opportunities to make even more meaningful progress towards higher environmental growth. Under the purview of our Sustainability Leadership Council, we are reviewing additional areas of opportunity, which could include a Scope 3 emissions goal, the benefits of avoided emissions and/or other potential scenarios. I expect to share more with you on these exciting topics by midyear. Now please turn to slide number 10, which shows our EPS growth. While we focus on our strong long-term prospects, we remain vigilant and motivated to deliver excellent near-term results consistent with our strategy and what we have already promised to investors. As you can see, we have delivered on what would we promised you in 2014 and achieved an 11% annual cumulative EPS growth on average since 2014, while building a strong foundation for our future growth. The excellent results and key projects we have executed, represent the initial stages of our strategy to advance the world toward a cleaner energy future. I am very optimistic about our company's prospects to capitalize on these growing opportunities by being a meaningful player in the energy transition. Now please turn to slide number 11. As a reminder, we do share our earnings growth directly with our customers through our dividend, while we continue to invest in growth opportunities. The whole team at Air Products is very proud that we just announced our 40th consecutive year of dividend increase. This tremendous long-term record is a testament to our people and our strength and consistency of our business model. The most recent increase is 8%, which increases our dividend to $1.62 per share per quarter, which we expect to – will translate to directly returning more than $1.4 billion to our shareholders in 2022. And as Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will share with you in a moment, we have significant remaining cash flow to support our many project opportunities. And finally, please turn to Slide number 12, still my favorite slide since it captures in one chart the progression of our business since 2014. We continue to deliver strong underlying results but our margin declined in recent quarters, primarily driven by higher energy pass-through, which increases our sales but doesn't impact profit. Two-third of the margin decline from our peak is due to the impact of this higher energy pass-through. But as I indicated last quarter, we are continuing to take action to improve our margins through controlling costs and increasing prices to cover cost increases. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Melissa to discuss our results in more detail. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. Now, please turn to Slide 13. Before we discuss the details of our first quarter results, I would like to highlight a few notable items in our reported financials first quarter. As we previously announced, we reorganized our reporting segments starting this quarter. To provide more visibility to our regions, we separated the previous EMEA segment into Europe and a Middle East and India segment. The new segment is made up of our business in the Middle East, which includes the new Jazan joint venture in India. Additionally, we combine Global Gases with the Corporate and Other segment. The historical resegmented financial information is available in a Form 8-K, which we published in December. We are proud to have completed Phase 1 of the $12 billion Jazan joint venture in late October. This milestone has led to two separate but related events, which impact our results favorably this quarter. First was the start of a new joint venture known as JIGPC's ongoing financial contribution consistent with the contract between the joint venture in Saudi Aramco. On an ongoing basis, our portion of the Jazan joint venture's net profit isn't included in equity affiliate income since we don't consolidate this joint venture. We also recognized interest income on the shareholder loans associated with our $1.5 billion investment, which is included in the non-operating income line of our income statement. To be clear, these are loans from Air Products to the joint venture and are a mechanism for us to efficiently fund our contribution. Together, these two income streams drive $0.80 to $0.85 of annual Phase 1 EPS, exactly what we expected and committed to our shareholders and consistent with what we recognized for two months in Q1. We remain on track for closing of Phase 2 in 2023. Second a non-reoccurring event of approximately $0.20 involved the transfer of the air separation units supporting the gasifiers at Jazan from our previous ASU joint venture to the Jazan joint venture. This transfer required the final settlement of our ASU joint venture which previously owned and operated these air separation units and enabled us to recognize a portion of the profit that was deferred when Air Products sold the ASUs to the joint venture. This profit was recognized as equity affiliate income. Partially offsetting this and also in equity affiliate income recorded a loss associated with the ASU joint venture settlement. Our joint venture partner's share of the settlement loss is reflected as a favorable noncontrolling interest item. Now, please turn to slide 14 for our first quarter results. Compared to last year, sales increased 26% to nearly $3 billion. Volume and price were strong and together account for 13% of the increase, while the remaining half was driven by higher energy pass-through. Rapidly escalating energy costs continue to negatively impact our business across the region this quarter. The situation was especially challenging in Europe and Americas as natural gas and electricity costs surged even higher from the already elevated levels we saw last quarter. Simon will share more details but in Europe natural gas costs were almost six times higher and power costs are almost four times higher than the beginning of the year. Our on-site business about half of our total company sales has contractual protection from the energy cost increases. The costs are passed on to the customer. The energy cost pass-through drove sales 14% higher but did not impact our profits. In our merchant business, our teams around the world have quickly executed price actions to help offset the escalating energy costs. For this quarter, prices improved compared to last year and last quarter in all three largest segments; Asia, Europe, and the Americas. We are able to recognize a 10% price increase across the merchant business, which translated to a 5% increase in price for the total company. This is our best pricing results in many years. I would like to thank all our teams for the excellent work they have done in response to such a significant challenge. However, we still have more work to do. We are actively executing against price actions across the regions to recover the unprecedented cost impacts. Volume improved 8% up in all segments driven by new assets, hydrogen and merchant recovery, and stronger sale of equipment activities. EBITDA increased 8% again exceeding the $1 billion mark for a quarter as favorable volume prices and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 570 basis points, mostly due to the higher energy pass-through which negatively impacted our margins about 450 basis points, while higher cost net of price increases contributed to the remaining shortfall. Sequentially volumes were down 3% primarily due to the strong sale of equipment in prior quarter. The 2% price increase was a direct result of our ongoing price action. EBITDA was 4% lower sequentially as better price and equity affiliate income were more than offset by higher costs and lower sale of equipment profit recognition. ROCE was 10.3%. We currently have significant cash on our balance sheet, which will support the major projects we have announced. Adjusting for this cash, our ROCE would have been 13.9%. We expect ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash and bring projects on stream. Now please turn to slide 15. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $2.52, which is $0.40 or 19% above last year. Volume was favorable $0.19. And price net of variable cost was modestly unfavorable $0.04 as our price actions were able to offset most of the unprecedented energy cost increases. For the quarter, our price actions alone before netting against variable costs contributed about $0.40. Costs were up this quarter. Similar to prior quarters, our growth strategy has us continuing to invest in additional resources. The very high and dynamic energy prices in our last -- in our largest three segments also impacted our supply chain, as we incurred higher operating and distribution costs to keep our customers supplied. We had additional discretionary compensation this quarter and a positive settlement of a supply contract last year, neither of which will continue in the future. The ongoing EPS contribution of the Jazan joint venture this quarter represents two months and is consistent with our commitment, adding to both equity affiliate income and non-operating income. Equity affiliate income increased $0.29, including the ongoing Jazan results, the deferred profit recognition and the unfavorable ASU joint venture settlement which I mentioned earlier. Non-controlling interest was $0.07 favorable versus prior year, representing our partner’s portion of the ASU joint venture settlement. Non-operating income was flat, as the interest income from the shareholder loans associated with the Jazan joint venture was offset by higher pension expense. Our first quarter effective tax rate of 17.1% was 220 basis points lower than last year, including the favorable impact of Jazan. It is seasonally lower primarily due to the additional share-based compensation and we still expect our tax rate to be 19% to 20% this year. Now please turn to slide 16. The stability of our business continues to allow us to generate strong cash flow, despite the challenging energy environment. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.8 billion of distributable cash flow or about $12.50 per share. From our EBITDA of almost $4 billion, we pay interest tax and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual, driven in part by the spending on our new global headquarters, which is now essentially complete. From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or $1.3 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.5 billion available for high-return projects. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. Slide number 17 provides an update on our capital deployment. We continue to make great progress in developing and executing our major growth projects. In fact, we see potential opportunities significantly greater than the investment capacity we show here. With the closing of Jazan Phase 1, we see a reduction in cash on hand and an increase in capital RA spent. As you can see our deployment potential is over $33 billion through fiscal 2027. The $33 billion includes over $8 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, over $16 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and over $9 billion already spent. We still believe this capacity is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth which generates additional cash flow and additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. So you can see we've already spent 27% and have already committed 70% of the updated capacity we show here. We have made great progress and still have substantial investment capacity remaining to invest in high-return projects. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. Seifi? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide number 18 for our Asia results. Sales were up 9% compared to last year. Volumes grew 4% due to a strong on-site volume as a variety of the small to medium-sized new plants came on the stream across the region. The Lu'An facility continues to operate at full capacity under the interim supply agreement. We continue to recognize that reduced fee in quarter one consistent with this interim supply agreement. We expect this to continue through fiscal year 2022 before returning to the full fee in 2023. We saw the best price performance for Asia in nearly two years. The 3% overall price increase improvement for the region equals to about 8% price increase for our merchant business. Our team has implemented price action in response to higher power costs and general inflation. China's government has also relaxed its power tariff program to allow local power costs to fluctuate. This market-oriented approach may result in more variability in our power costs going forward. We are monitoring this situation very closely. In addition China's effort to reduce energy usage and intensity through its Dual Control policy continue to impact customer demand and caused isolated disruptions of our plants. This had a very modest negative impact on our plant efficiency and supply chain costs. This impact was more prominent earlier in the quarter and seem to ease in December. Costs were also unfavorable due to resources that we needed to add to support our new project start-ups in the region and higher without the COVID-related government incentives that we received last year. EBITDA was up 2% as better volume, price and currencies more than offset higher costs. Sequentially, sales and profits were up at as strong price more than offset higher costs. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Simon to talk about our European results. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you Seifi. Now please turn to slide 19. Before I get into our Europe results and to build on Melissa's comments earlier, I wanted to share some details related to the unprecedented energy cost increases this quarter. Energy costs climbed throughout the quarter from already elevated levels. Natural gas costs were almost six times higher and power costs were almost four times higher than the beginning of the calendar year. While the energy costs have been elevated all year this quarter saw energy costs more than double from the previous quarter. As Melissa mentioned our on-site business has contractual pass-through of the higher costs. For the merchant business, our team has delivered significant price actions to partially recover the recent cost increases. I also would like to thank our European team for their extraordinary efforts. Although, we are very proud of the work done by our team, our price actions have not fully recovered the cost increase. And as Melissa said we have more work to do. We do believe we will be able to recover this shortfall by the end of the year. Now please turn to slide 20 for a review of our Europe results. Sales increased 37% versus last year. Volume and price were strong and together grew 14%. However, our profit and margin were unfavorable this quarter due to the dramatic energy cost increases. The energy cost pass-through increased sales 27% but did not increase profit. For the quarter, our price actions resulted in a 9% price gain for the region, which corresponds to a 14% improvement for the merchant business. Prices were higher across all major product lines and sub-regions. Volume increased 5%, primarily driven by improved hydrogen and merchant demand. Currencies were unfavorable 4% primarily due to the weaker euro against the US dollar. For this quarter other costs also increased. The very significant energy cost increases also disrupted our supply chain, negatively impacting both plant operating and distribution efficiencies. We also saw inflation, higher maintenance, discretionary incentive compensation and COVID related costs, while we continue to invest in additional resources needed to support our growth strategy. EBITDA was down 19% as higher costs were partially offset by price increases. Volume was positive in sales, but did not contribute significantly to profit due to unfavorable mix. EBITDA margin was 1,500 basis points lower. About 700 basis points of the decline was due to the significant energy cost pass-through increase, while the remainder was mostly due to higher costs, partially offset by price in the merchant business. Compared to prior quarter, EBITDA was 19% lower due to unfavorable business mix, higher costs and lower equity affiliate income. Higher energy pass-through also negatively impacted margin by about 350 basis points sequentially. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan for a brief discussion of our other segments.
Samir Serhan: Thank you Simon. Now please turn to slide 21 for a review of our Americas results. Sales increased more than 30% versus last year. Volume and price together were up 11%, while energy cost pass-through accounted for the remaining increase. Volume grew 8%, primarily due to hydrogen recovery and a strong merchant demand. Although, our hydrogen business has improved, it has not yet fully returned to its pre-COVID levels. Similar to other regions, Americas also experienced significant energy cost increases versus last year. Our team has done an excellent job raising prices to cover the energy cost increase in this quarter. The 3% gain for the region is equivalent to 9% on our merchant business. Costs were favorable despite inflation and supply chain-related challenges and partly due to lower maintenance costs this quarter. We expect planned maintenance activities to pick up next quarter. EBITDA posted another double-digit gain, 14% ahead of last year as better volume, price and equity affiliate income more than offset the higher energy costs. EBITDA margin was 560 basis points lower than last year. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 700 basis points. In other words, EBITDA margin would have been up excluding the energy cost pass-through. Sequentially, EBITDA was lower due to higher maintenance costs. Higher energy costs pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by about 300 basis points. Now please turn to Slide 22, our newly created Middle East and India segment. Again as I stated before, this segment is composed of our businesses in the Middle East including the Jazan joint venture and our business in India. Sales and operating income in this segment are modest since our Middle East and India wholly owned operations are smaller in size. However, the segment's EBITDA is significant since it includes the equity affiliate income related to the Jazan joint venture and our India joint venture. The roughly $70 million increase in equity affiliate income included our share of the Jazan joint venture net profit for two months. And the net impact, due to the finalization of the ASU joint venture that Melissa previously discussed. Sales and operating income are up compared to last year due to a new facility on stream in India, but are down sequentially to a favorable – due to a favorable contract settlement in the previous quarter. Now, please turn to Slide 23, which addresses our new Corporate segment, which now includes our previous Global Gases segment. This segment includes our sale of equipment businesses as well as our centrally managed functions and corporate costs. Over the past few years, our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses have grown considerably are now contributing most of the sales in this segment. However, the margins of these businesses are typically below our company average. Sales were higher in this quarter, driven by increased project activities but the profits were lower due to higher corporate costs and without last year's settlement of a supply contract. At this point I would like to return the call back over to Seifi to provide his closing comments. Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much Dr. Serhan. During my nearly five decades in business, I have learned that the world changes all the time sometimes in very unpredictable ways as we have seen in the past several years. Therefore for an organization the ability to anticipate, plan, and react to change with speed and resiliency is key to success. I have also learned that all challenges can be addressed by staying focused and united and calm and by working towards a common goal. That is why I'm proud that despite the continuing adverse effects of the pandemic, the rising costs, inflation, supply chain disruptions, and all of the challenges facing us our people at Air Products have done just what we expected them to do. That is they have adapted to the change and are acting accordingly. This is why we delivered strong results despite all of these challenges. Our volume, price, and profits all grew this quarter versus last year even as they stayed the course and added resources to support our opportunities and world-scale projects for the cleaner energy future. I truly believe that our company has become even stronger in the past two years and fully expect to deliver significant earnings growth as the economies around the world normalize and our new projects come on stream. Now, please turn to slide number 24. As I said I remain highly confident of Air Products' resilient business model our strategy and our execution. However, I do have some concerns on the economic backdrop driven by continued COVID challenge, the impact of supply chain constraints, inflation, energy costs, and geopolitical tensions. Therefore for quarter two of fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance is $2.30 to $2.40, up $0.11 to $0.15 over last year. For fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $10.20 to $10.40, which is 13% to 15% better than last year. We continue to see our capital expenditure in 2022 to be around $4.5 billion to $5 billion including the approximately $1.5 billion for Phase 1 of the Jazan project. Now, please turn to slide number 25. The opportunities created by the energy transition are immense. That is why through our mega projects in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, we are acting as a first mover. We are taking real action through real world-scale investments in projects that address significant energy and environmental challenges. We have the portfolio of experiences and technologies that we can bring together in an optimal configuration for a project. Working with customers and countries around the world, we will deliver low carbon forms of energy and improve their sustainability. In addition to investment and technology, we know that as always, the real enablers of this transition are the people who work alongside our customers and bring our opportunities and projects to life. At Air Products, we have consciously increased our talent and resources to take on these urgent challenges adding over 3,000 people over the past two years. As we drive toward a clean energy world, we need talented people to help us accelerate the progress. We are continuing to build a diverse and inclusive culture that our people feel they belong and know that their contribution matters. As I always say, our long-term competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of our people. I know that through their hard work and contribution, we will continue to succeed. Now, we are pleased to answer your questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you.  And we'll go ahead and take our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning, Seifi and the team.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, P.J. How are you this morning?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. A couple of questions. First, can you give us an update on the NEOM project, especially on the downstream side where you will be executing on your own? Is there any update on contract signings? And then the significant disruption that we are seeing in energy pricing in Europe, does that create uncertainty for customers to commit to long-term contracts on that side?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, P.J., thank you for the question. The new project with respect to the downstream side, obviously, we are working in developing the infrastructure needed to bring in the green ammonia, crack it and then sell it to our customers. So those projects are underway. In terms of any contract signing and all of that, we have said from the beginning two years ago that we are going to be very cautious about saying anything about that, because that is an issue of competitive advantage. And we certainly don't want to give all of our secrets away. With respect to the question that you asked about energy costs, obviously, the significant fluctuation in energy costs and especially them going up is going to make it more competitive for the green and clean products. So from that point of view, the level of interest in Green hydrogen and Blue hydrogen has significantly increased around the world. 
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. That's fair enough. And a quick question for Melissa. On Slide 13 you mentioned interest income from loans to Jazan. Can you just give us more details on that loan? 
Seifi Ghasemi: And Melissa will address that but that's a very, very complicated transaction and I'm not sure she will be able to answer all of your details of your question on the call. We can always have another call with you on the side to give you the details. But I'll turn it over to Melissa to say what you can on this call. Go ahead Melissa. 
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you very much Seifi. Thank you P.J. for the question. So as Seifi mentioned very complex, but just a quick highlight. So as we mentioned during our statements that 1/3 of the contribution from the JIGPC joint venture is in nonoperating income. This is the interest income on our investment as a shareholder loan. So this is just our efficient way of funding the joint venture. 
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, P.J..
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, thank you Seifi. 
Operator: We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. 
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Simon, you made a comment about in the European segment you expect to recover costs with price actions by year-end. Just wanted to drill into that a little more. Can you comment on what fraction of your merchant business has this pass-through in it? Perhaps it's small, but do you have it in place in some, but in order for you to recover it by year-end are you -- do you have more price actions that you have yet to announce, or is there a lag effect, or do you expect cost to come down? I just would like to better understand that. 
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. It's actually pretty straightforward. What happens is that we anticipate energy cost increases and the announced price increases. But energy prices have been going up significantly higher than our anticipation. Therefore, we need to take a delayed action to increase prices to recover what has happened in the past. That is why there will be a delay in recovering the cost. We will take the action. But obviously from the time we take the action and invoice the customer until we get the money and all of that there is a delayed action. But fundamentally we can't increase prices every day. We do that every quarter. And what we anticipated for the first quarter of this year was significantly lower than what actually happened. So now we have increased prices starting January 1 and we will increase prices starting April 1st, and as we go with different customers and that is why there is a lag. 
Steve Byrne: And any update on the pass-through in the contract? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the merchant business a lot of it is not a contract. The pass-through which is per contract is for our on-site business. That is pass-through. That hasn't affected our results and all of those pass-throughs have happened. That is why our results on our on-sites are very good. On the merchant side, which in Europe is approximately 60% of our business that is where we executed the price increases. And over there most of the contracts do not have official pass-through it's a merchant business. Yes?
Steve Byrne: Okay. And one more for you, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah.
Steve Byrne: It seems like your focus and goals on energy has kind of expanded to beyond hydrogen to include carbon capture now. My question for you is do you see this as a business development for our products that could be completely independent of hydrogen, i.e. working with customers to perhaps capture carbon from combustion sources? That's a completely different approach and perhaps that could drive increased sales of oxygen. Just where would you like to see that particular business go for Air Products?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is an excellent question. At this point in time, we are doing carbon capture in order to produce green -- I mean, blue hydrogen specifically. So I don't see us branching into that. But if that becomes a very attractive sector and we have the technology we take a look at it. But right now we are doing carbon capture those projects in conjunction with producing blue hydrogen.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Steve.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Hi. Thanks very much. You earned 252 in the quarter. And so if you annualize that that's 10.10. And your guidance is 10.20 to 10.40 and the December quarter is probably a seasonally weak quarter. So it doesn't seem like you expect very much progress or maybe you're really at the top of your range or a little bit beyond that. Why aren't your earnings higher this year? Energy costs are coming down in Europe. You're passing through prices. Shouldn't you have higher returns this year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, the thing is that everything, obviously, depends on your view of the world and in terms of what will happen. Look at this quarter, we had high expectations for this quarter but then COVID came in and Europe got shut down. And energy price has been up significantly higher. I am not shy to say that I am very concerned about some of the geopolitical tensions what would be the implications of that for energy prices. Heavens forbid if anything happens we do train and so on, but that's due to Europe energy. So as a result, we are trying to be balanced and give people projections that we realistically believe we can meet. Now you can say we are conservative, but we might not be. But we didn't see any reason at this point in time considering what has happened in the first quarter to change our guidance. Now if next quarter things change we will, obviously, share any thoughts that we have with you.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then secondly, I'm always puzzled about your corporate EBITDA line. Can you give us any insight into what that number might be over the next three quarters? Does it change much? Is there a certain level? And then for Melissa, the undistributed earnings of equity method investments in the quarter were negative 117. What should that number be for the year, order of magnitude?
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Jeff, I'll answer your first question and Melissa will answer your second question. The thing is that that corporate sector obviously from my point of view, I'd like to see the number to be basically an EBITDA thing to be balanced. That means that we make enough money on the other parts of the business in order to balance our corporate overhead. That's our goal. But obviously, because it is some of the sale of equipment, it goes up and down quarter-by-quarter. But overall, we would like to see that number to be just flat. Basically, we don't make money we don't lose money. So with respect to your second question, Melissa would you like to address that, please? 
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you, Seifi. Jeff, I think you're referring to the undistributed earnings of equity affiliates and the cash flow statement. So this is... 
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes exactly right.
Melissa Schaeffer: Yes. Thank you. So this is cash on the operating activity from the joint venture. So as the dividends are distributed later this year, which we fully expect, they will go through the investment section.
Jeff Zekauskas: Great. Thanks so much.
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, Jeff.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, Seifi. Just a question on the European energy issues. So it sounds like, if I'm understanding and I guess that's what I want to clear up, what you're putting through it's not a surcharge or anything like that it's more of a direct pricing. So if we start to see energy prices subside as we get past kind of the winter months, et cetera, it sounds like that would be a reasonable windfall for you as the pricing is going through as the energy is coming down. Am I thinking about that right, or is there some other nuance to consider?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all good morning, John. Hope all is well with you and I talked to you for one. With respect to the question that you're asking, you always get it right. That is exactly what we're trying to do. That means that we are increasing the prices. And then hopefully, as energy cost goes down, we expect to keep some of those prices because to make up for the fact that we didn't get enough of it in the previous quarters. So you're right. If energy prices go down, if they go down then we will have an upside. But that's a big if John. But that is exactly, right. You have – you are thinking about it exactly the way we are trying to execute.
John McNulty: Got it. Okay. And then just a question on the Third by '30 carbon intensity goal that you have. I guess when you think about the three big hydrogen projects the two big blue ones and the green one, does that actually get you to that target already, or is there more to do there? And I guess tied to that, are there projects going forward that Air Products might not do just because of the carbon intensity around them that in the past they might have. So say whatever, it's a big coal gasification project where there's no carbon capture or something like that. Does that – does a target like this preclude you from actually going after that type of business? I guess how should we be thinking about that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, John that is an excellent question. First of all, in my comments, you're very smart you read through it I was saying that look at the projects that we are doing we think we can meet that target and exceed it. And therefore we are going to give you an update by midyear. So, you're right. I mean we are doing a lot of good projects and that would help us. With respect to your second question it depends on how the contracts are structured John because countries will come to us have come to us and said, I want you to do this project. It's co-gasification and you are not responsible for the CO2. I give you the raw material and you give me the product, you adjust the total and the CO2 is my responsibility. If people are willing to do it like that as they have been then we do the project because then we are not adding any CO2 to the world somebody else is doing that. You see what I mean? But if it turns out that we are doing a project when the CO2 is our responsibility, then we would think twice about doing anything. Sure because we are about reducing CO2 in the world not adding to it. But there are circumstances that the customers the country comes to us and said, look I don't want to take the coal and make methanol out of it and I'll take the responsibility for the CO2. Okay John? Makes sense? 
John McNulty: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks very much Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Chris your line is open.
Chris Parkinson: Sorry about that. I was on mute. Can you just give us a bit of a broader view on the situation of China Lu'An as well some just very quick updates Jiutai and Debang. Just how should investors be thinking about the cadence of these projects? Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning Chris. But the thing is that I gave you an update on Lu'An that the project is -- the plant is operating at full scale and all of that. And we had consciously given a break to the customer for two years for a lot of good reasons. And now we expect that to be going back to normal at the October of 2022. The other projects are being executed on plan. We don't expect any major issues with those. So, up to now we are -- we don't have any significant disruption that we need to talk about.
Chris Parkinson: Got it. Thank you. No, that's very helpful. And just as a very quick follow-up prior to COVID there was a lot of talk and obviously, there were some projects signed across Central and Southeast Asia. It seems like you still have a very large opportunity in Indonesia and there's still several projects being decided on in India. Could you just give us a very quick update on your overall thought process and how those would potentially fit in to the APD's backlog? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we have decided not to talk about those projects and there are a lot of them as you alluded to until we sign a final contract. So, we don't want to announce MOUs or we don't want to announce every time that I have a video conference with the minister or anything like that. So, those -- the opportunities are there. And when those contracts get to the stage that they are definitive contracts, then we will obviously announce them, but those projects are there. We haven't seen any slowdown.
Chris Parkinson: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: But they are delayed because of COVID in terms of getting to the final stage of the contract. But I expect that they do.
Chris Parkinson: Understandable. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: We'll take our next question with David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hey, David. How are you?
David Begleiter: I’m doing well, sir. How are you, Seifi?
Seifi Ghasemi: Very good, very good.
David Begleiter: In Europe, you mentioned the delays in implementing or capturing the pricing this time around. Why is that the case? Is that because of the sharp rise in energy prices? And are you seeing similar cadences by competitors in delaying or extending captures until the end of the year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. David, I'm very glad that you asked the question. When we say the delay, please it is not as if we are delayed in price increases. We are following -- let's say, here is the month of end of April, right? And our team gets together and say, we anticipate that prices in June July and August, the price of energy will go up 10%. Therefore, we announce a 10% increase on prices on June 1, right? If the price during that quarter of June, July and August goes up 20%, then we have fallen behind. Then in the month -- the next quarter, now we need to raise the prices 30% to catch up again. But then the energy prices -- but our issue in Europe has been that every time we anticipate price increases, the actual price increases goes way beyond that. There was no way that we would have predicted, no way, that natural gas prices in Europe will go up 6 times. There was no way that we would have predicted that electricity cost in Europe will get to $0.20 a kilowatt. So that is the delay. It is not as if we are delayed in action. It is the fact that our anticipation of price increases were lower because we thought it was pretty robust, but the real world got ahead of us. That is why we are lagging behind. We think that we will see a significant improvement in the performance of our business in Europe in the quarter we are in. I fully expect that. But who knows what happens with the energy price? That is our inability. That is where we are falling short in terms of ability to predict energy prices, but nobody could do that because they have been so unprecedented, that if at the beginning of last year you would have told somebody that electricity costs for Air Products will go from a few cents a 100 , to $0.20, we would have thought that was unreasonable. But that's the way it has worked out. I hope I made myself clear, David, doing a lot of talking.
David Begleiter: No, very clear. Just for Melissa on Jazan. Melissa, what was the net impact of the transfer of the ASU assets this quarter, the net impact? 
Melissa Schaeffer: The next impact was about 27 .
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. On Slide 15 you provide a helpful disaggregation of the EPS growth. And as I read it, it looks as though you're recovering the vast majority of the energy cost increases in terms of the $0.04 drag from price net of variable. Then below that there's a $0.21 headwind from other costs. Can you speak to what costs are resident in that $0.21 number? And how you would expect that to trend over time? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi Kevin, very good question. The thing is that, there is a list of about 30 items in there and we can go through that with you off-line in terms of some of that. Some of that has got to do with the fact that we had some one-off benefits last year. So when you compare this year to last year those numbers look as if the costs have gone up significantly. But there is no question that the -- our underlying costs are higher because of all of the money that we are spending in the development of the projects that -- the mega projects. I mean each one of these projects takes $5 million $10 million to develop. As I said before, we have added 3000 people to our organization in order to deal with that. Now as some of these projects become investment projects and approved by our board then some of these costs could go into capital rather than just being charged to the bottom line. But while a lot is going on they are charged to the bottom line. They are ongoing costs. So, I don't expect the number to be as big as it is this quarter. But underlying we probably have $20 million $30 million a year of additional cost because of what we are doing with the mega projects. 
Kevin McCarthy: I see. That's very helpful. And then secondly you raised your dividend by 8% yesterday. If I look at the EPS guidance that would suggest potential for growth of 14% at the midpoint. Can you speak to the delta between those numbers? What is the thinking behind adopting a more measured pace for the dividend relative to what you contemplate for earnings? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Well again thank you for the question, Kevin. And we thought 8% is pretty robust. You're saying that your dividend is not growing as much as your EPS. But we obviously want to have some cash for growth. But there is another measure that we have talked about. This is not how we decide on dividend. We have a lot of factors into that. But overall, we have always said that we want the dividend to be something between 2% to 2.5% of the stock price, in terms of our dividend yield. So if you take $1.62 x 4 and divide it by the stock price, we are at around 2.3%, 2.4%. That's another measure. But as I said that's not the only way that we decide on EPS. There's a lot of factors in terms of cash flow and all of that. But that's -- and besides that we are way ahead of everybody else in our sector in terms of dividend. So we didn't want to overdo it Kevin. 
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Thank you for that reminder.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, John.
John Roberts: Good morning. You mentioned your power costs in China might fluctuate more. Are the merchant contracts in China any different than your merchant contracts in Europe and elsewhere that you might have a harder time dealing with those fluctuations?
Seifi Ghasemi: I don't think so John. I mean at the end of the day this is all a function of the competitive environment and the utilization of your facilities. In China right now, our utilization of our merchant facilities is in mid-80s. So at mid-80s if power costs go up I think we will have the ability to pass that through.
John Roberts: And I think it was mentioned that pension costs actually went up. It was a bit of a contributor to the headwind. It's going down for a lot of other companies because of interest rates going up and good plan performance last year. Why would your pension be going up?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, there is a lot of reason because we have a lot more people. We have 3,000 more people that we need to -- people say that okay you need to provide for these people and so on. But we don't have too many defined pension plans. But I'd like to see if Melissa has anything else to add to that. This is function of actuaries doing all the numbers how long people are going to live and all of that, you know all of that. But Melissa do you have anything else to add? 
Melissa Schaeffer: Yeah. Thank you Seifi. Because of where we are in our funding, we are going through a derisking glide path. And that is a portion of the reason that you're seeing that change.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Mike Sison: I guess, given high energy costs, electricity costs and industrial gases tend to be used as an efficiency aid for a lot of facilities. Is this environment good for the fundamental demand for industrial gases over the next couple of years? I mean, will it spark more bigger -- many projects or just general demand for oxygen, nitrogen et cetera?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, for that to materialize, we need to get COVID to go away so that the economic activity goes up. And then usually inflationary environment is a good thing for industrial gases usually, but not always. But we think that if the inflationary environment continues and we are able to increase prices and then if the cycle turns and we keep some of those price increases that might be a positive. It's very difficult to quantify that right now.
Mike Sison: Got it. And a quick follow-up in Europe. EBITDA was down about $40 million. Is that the delta that you need to just offset with pricing over the next couple of quarters?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. That's most of it, yes.
Mike Sison: Great. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Harrison: Seifi, I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the impact of dual control in China on your Asia volumes, as well as the margin impact. You mentioned some plant efficiency and supply chain was also impacted. And then it sounds like maybe the dual control policy is evolving. You said you were watching it closely. So do you expect a similar impact in Q2 or maybe not as bad?
Seifi Ghasemi: Mike in my comments I tried to shed some light into that by saying that first of all the impact, there was an impact but it was not material in the first quarter. The impact was a lot more in the month of October than it turned out to be in the month of November and December. And it seems that the harshness with which the government was trying to implement that back in September, October, has subsided a little bit. And as a result, we don't expect any material effect of that on our results in the next quarter.
Mike Harrison: All right. And then in terms of the inflationary environment, as you look at some of your committed projects and the capital associated with them, are you seeing higher costs for labor and equipment steel, other materials, increase the capital costs associated with those projects? And do those higher costs then get passed on to the customer through some change in the base facility charge, or do they end up eating into returns if your capital costs are higher?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, when we did some of these projects, we obviously have made provisions for possible inflation and all that. But at the end of the day it is a fact that some of the costs are going up. In terms of how much of it we can pass on to the on-site customers and so on is very much dependent on the details of the contract that we have negotiated with the specific customers. So I cannot make a general statement. But overall, there is pressure on us to be very diligent to make sure that we stay on top of the cost for our projects and all of that and make sure that they don't eat into our returns as you alluded to.
Mike Harrison: All right. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer: Question around your new segment the Middle East and India. If you look at the $103 million of EBITDA and you normalize for having Jazan for the full quarter and not changing the JV structure what would like a normalized EBITDA run rate be for that segment? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Well I – to some extent, you can calculate it in the sense that for the first quarter you have two months of Jazan. So for the next quarter, you have three months of Jazan. And most of that cost is Jazan. So you can kind of triangulate that approximately to come up with the number you are looking for.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And then going forward how variable will that EBITDA number be? Is there seasonality in it? Are there going to be lumpy quarters where you've got turnarounds and stuff like that, or will it be in a very tight range and you kind of just print the same number quarter-over-quarter until you move on from Phase 1?
Seifi Ghasemi: I expect that number to be pretty stable because it's basically a facility too. I don't expect that to change significantly and our maintenance cost shouldn't change that significantly.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. Thanks guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hey good morning.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Seifi I'm reading about there's about $9 million in infrastructure grants in the US that are going to come out. Is it fair to assume that you'll be positioning the company to get some part of that for hydrogen projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: We will try for sure.
Vincent Andrews: And what order of magnitude do you think that could be?
Seifi Ghasemi: I have no idea because it depends on what gets allocated how much of that will be for hydrogen where the locations will be what would be the criteria? I mean we are -- these projects as you know there's sometimes a lot of strings attached that some of it might not be acceptable to us and all of that. So, it is very, very difficult to project at this stage because they have just started. They obviously are engaged with the Department of Energy because we have some real hydrogen projects. It's not theoretical. But I have really no visibility into what that number could be or should be.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And just as a follow-up there was a comment in the prepared remarks about Americas hydrogen still being below pre-COVID levels. Do you have a rough approximation of how below pre-COVID levels you are?
Seifi Ghasemi: Something in the order of magnitude of about 5% something like that. Dr. Serhan do you want to add to that?
Samir Serhan: Yes, it is Seifi. It's around 5% to 10% from about two years ago.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bob your line is open. And Bob, are you on mute? Okay. Due to no response, we will move on to our next question from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Marc Bianchi: Hey, thank you. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi.
Marc Bianchi: The question came up earlier -- hey Seifi. The question came up earlier about annualizing the EPS and getting $10. But if I try to take out all the one-time Jazan and the recurring contribution of Jazan, it sort of looks like to me that the second half EPS implied in the guidance is up about 15% to 20% from the first half just in the underlying business which seems like a big ramp. I know there's some favorable seasonality in there and you've got some pricing initiatives to recover some of the energy costs. But could you talk to maybe the components of that improvement, how much is seasonality what's anticipated in terms of energy recovery those sorts of things? I'm curious for some more color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. I mean, there is two pipelines. Obviously, we go through all of this thing before we give you guidance. And because of what you said that's why we didn't change our guidance for the year. But number one, you know the results for the first quarter. We have given you guidance for the second quarter, so you can add it up and you get to what we expect to make in the first half. Usually from a seasonality point of view, approximately, if you take all of the years, we make about 47%, 48% of our profit during the first half and 52% to 53% of it during the second half. So that is the seasonality kind of a thing that you can take a look at. And then the other thing is that, we do expect that we will get ahead of this energy cost in Europe a little bit and therefore, recover some of that. And therefore the performance of our European sector will be better. And when you look at this quarter, actually the performance of our business in Asia and in the United States were very good. It's just that Europe that hit our results. So if you put the combination of the seasonality and the recovery in Europe, then we have a reasonable chance of doing the guidance that we have given you.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. That’s all I had. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. In your European on-site business, are you receiving any kind of performance bonuses for running at higher operating rates and helping customers be more energy efficient, given the high electricity prices that they're facing?
Seifi Ghasemi: Nothing that substantial, because over there, those customers on our on-site business are obviously paying for the higher energy costs. So we are not receiving any special compensation or anything like that. They're just paying for the additional energy cost and we get our fee at our contract.
Laurence Alexander: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions. With that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much everybody for participating in our call. We appreciate your attention and your good questions. And we wish you good health and success for the balance of the quarter and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you again.
Operator: And with that, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-11-04 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of the Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Christina. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter 2021 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President, and CEO; Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer; Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide number 2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rate, and ROCE, both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and adjusted return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant Earnings Release section. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. Before we discuss the results, I would like to say that despite the well-known global challenges in 2020 and 2021, talented, committed and motivated people of Air Products demonstrated resilience and resolve, and delivered excellent results. And in addition, continue to execute our growth strategy. I want to thank every one of our employees for standing together, working hard and delivering for our customers and shareholders. Now please turn to Slide number 3, there you can see some of our key highlights for this year. We delivered strong EPS this year, achieving 11% compounded annual growth since fiscal year 2014. And we increased the dividend for the 39th consecutive year. We've had a gain recognized by procedures raters and organizations for outstanding sustainability performance, including one we just announced this week the EcoVadis for the fifth year in a row. Our growth strategy and sustainability strategy are one and the same. And to that end, we probably completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction for the $12 billion Jazan joint venture with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra, as we announced last week. In conjunction with the Government of Canada and the province of Alberta, we announced the new net zero hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This world-scale energy complex will begin with a transformative 1 billion net zero hydrogen production and the liquefaction expected on stream in 2024. And just a few weeks ago, we announced the $4.5 billion world-class clean energy complex in Louisiana. Air Products is built, own and operate this mega project which should produce over 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026. We will also capture and permanently sequester 5 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide, making it the largest carbon capture for sequestration facility in the world. By combining our core strengths and competencies, we successfully develop, execute and operate these large scale gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen projects to address the significant energy and environmental needs of the world. This is fully aligned with our higher purpose as a company. Now, please turn to Slide number 4, as always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products. And our goal will always be to achieve zero accidents and incidents. Despite the challenging COVID-19 condition this year, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect our own employees, our customers and our communities. We are pleased with the focus by the team that improved our safety performance in fiscal year ’21 versus last year. The Slides number 5, 6 and 7, which we have shared with you many times before, include our goals, our management philosophy, and our five point strategic plan. These are the principles that we follow every day, and they will continue to guide us in the future. Now please turn to Slide number 8, as we speak, world leaders are gathered in Glasgow to work on closing the gap between climate aspirations and climate action. We're actively engaged in this rapidly evolving global dialogue, and committed to ensuring that Air Products is best positioned to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders through this critical period of energy transition. We believe a successful energy transition requires successful development and execution of large scale mega projects. Without that the job cannot be done. The scope and complexity of these projects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds, from different parts of the world to work together as one team. This is the higher purpose of our company. We can overcome diverse significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges with our focus and united people working together to provide real solutions for our customers. Now please turn to Slide number 9, as I have said before, we believe that hydrogen is one of the energy sources of the future, along with electricity. We are scaling hydrogen production and developing an infrastructure to ensure this successful adoption as a sustainable fuel. Hydrogen will be the sustainable fuel of the future. Our customers count on us to deliver this hydrogen produced in a highly efficient manner. Meanwhile, we are making significant investments in new facilities to produce low carbon and carbon free hydrogen made from hydrocarbons. By executing on new clean hydrogen projects in Alberta and Louisiana, we will be the leader in blue hydrogen, as well as green hydrogen as we continue to execute our innovative new green hydrogen projects in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Now, with that background, I'm happy to turn the call over to Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer to talk about our major projects. Dr. Serhan?
Samir Serhan: Thank you, Seifi. Now, please turn to $slide 10, which highlights our key growth projects. We are committed to our growth strategy and continue to execute and pursue exciting projects around the world. In June, we announced the world-scale $1 billion net zero hydrogen project in Alberta, Canada, with the strong support of the Canadian, federal and local governments. This project will use natural gas to make net zero hydrogen, which has the same zero carbon footprint as a green hydrogen made from renewable energy. 95% of the co2 resulting from our net zero project will be permanently sequestered, and the remaining 5% will be offset by exporting a clean electricity produced by the clean hydrogen. The project provides a roadmap for hydrocarbon-based economies to significantly reduce their co2 emissions. Just a few weeks ago, we had the honor of joining the Governor of Louisiana and state officials to announce our world-scale $4.5 billion blue hydrogen project. This will also be the world's largest permanent co2 sequestration operation. This project will provide clean hydrogen to our customers, along our 700 mile U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system, and also produce blue ammonia targeting heavy transport around the world. The pipeline will be able to carry a variety of carbon intensity hydrogen, including gray and blue. These two projects will use advanced gasification technologies available to Air Products to produce clean hydrogen, while using hydrocarbon feedstock in a sustainable way. Both the projects also combined in one project, the three pillars of our growth strategy, gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen. We have made good progress on our Jiutai project, and we expect the facility to be on stream in fiscal year ‘23. We also expect the Debang project on stream in fiscal year ‘23. Successful execution of the Gulf Coast ammonia project continues with field construction on Air Products’ largest single train 175 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen, steam methane reformer, as well as the related 90 million standard cubic feet per day nitrogen, ASU facility and related utilities. Construction is also progressing well on the 30-mile hydrogen pipeline network expansion to our world's largest hydrogen pipeline network. The project on stream schedule remained as originally planned for the first-half of fiscal year ‘23. We're forging ahead in Indonesia, and making good progress despite some challenges due to COVID. We expect to complete this project in ‘25. For NEOM, as you can see in the picture on the slide, we are laying the groundwork for the project, preparing the land and doing detail engineering. We're even more excited now about this project since our announcement last year. We're forecasting to export the zero carbon hydrogen in the form of ammonia in 2026. In addition to our mega projects Air Products has also continued to make significant investments in small and mid-sized on-site generators, and our regional industrial gases business, with fiscal year ‘21 being a record year for investments in this category. These on-site plans which typically have a project investment values from $0.5 million to $50 million cover a range of technologies from a present oxygen VSA, Vacuum Swing Adsorption and small and mid-sized PRISM ASUs. Specifically, fiscal year ‘21 was a record year for investments in our PRISM oxygen VSA product line, with the new projects in North America, Europe, India, China and South Korea, predominantly, supplying several major glass manufacturers around the world. The oxygen VSAs are frequently integrated with Air Products’ oxy fuel burner technology, which helps reduce emissions, provide fuel saving, improve productivity, and deliver operational savings for the customer. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Please turn to Slide number 11, as we shared with you last week, we along with our joint venture partners, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction of the $12 billion air separation unit, gasification and power joint venture with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, making a significant milestone after the hard work by our people, as well as our customers and partners. The project return is expected to be better than we originally envisioned. As we said last week, we expect Phase 1 of the project to contribute an annual run rate of $0.80 to $0.85 of earnings per share, starting as of last week. The project is expected to contribute about $1.35 to $140 for the first 10-years after Phase 2 closes. Now please turn to Slide number 12, which shows our EPS growth. We remain vigilant and motivated to deliver excellent financial results, consistent with our strategy. As you can see, we have delivered 11% annual EPS growth on average since 2014, while laying a strong foundation for our future growth. The excellent results and key milestones we have achieved this year are just the beginning of our journey, delivering gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen solutions to the world. I am very optimistic about our company's prospects, participating in a very meaningful way in the energy transition. Now, please turn to Slide number 13. As a reminder, we share our earnings growth directly with our investors. Both our EPS and dividends have grown by double digits since 2014. We are committed to deliver increased dividends, while we continue to execute our growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividends, and as you know, we have increased that now for the 39th consecutive year. And finally, Slide number 14, as always my favorite slide shows that our EBITDA margins are up 1,100 basis points since 2014. Our margin is down in recent quarters, impacted by higher energy pass-through which increases our sales, but doesn't impact profits. Two-thirds of the margin decline from our peak margin is due to the impact of higher energy pass-through. But, I do want to stress that we are determined and focused on improving our margins back to around 40%, by increasing prices to cover significant increases in energy costs, and by improving productivity. Now, I'm happy to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss our results in more detail. Melissa?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you, Seifi. We have made great strides executing our growth strategy this year, completing multiple projects and winning exciting new projects. At the same time, we continue to focus our base business and delivered excellent results for the quarter and the year. We grew our EPS 8% this year, overcoming various external challenges and absorbing the cost of additional resources needed to support our growth strategy. Our distributable cash flow remain strong at $2.7 billion. Furthermore, the large scale projects currently under development will substantially add to our earnings, once we bring them on stream. I share Seifi’s conviction that for Air Products, the best is indeed yet to come. This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products. And, I too, want to thank them. Now please turn to Slide 15 for more details on our full year results. Sales grew 17% to more than $10 billion. Volume and price together gained 7%. The 5% volume growth was primarily driven by our EMEA and Global Gases segments. Although, the adverse impact from the pandemic has eased through the year, it still had a negative impact on FY ‘21. Price improved every quarter in all three regions and across most major product lines. Overall, price increased 2% and our merchant price was up 5%. EBITDA was up 7%, approaching $4 billion, due to favorable price, currency, and equity affiliate income, which was partially offset by higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 330 basis points, of which 200 basis points are attributed to higher energy pass-through, which increases sales but negatively impacts margin. ROCE was 160 basis points lower. The increase in the denominator from our additional $5 billion of debt raise last year, reduced ROCE by about 300 basis points. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our ROCE would be 14.2%. We expect ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash and bring projects on stream. Now please turn to Slide 16 for discussion of full year EPS. Our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.64, or 8%. Price, net of variable cost was again strong, favorable $0.34, the fourth consecutive year of double digit EPS net price improvement. Volume was flat as acquisitions, new plan, merchant recovery and higher sale of equipment activity were offset by lower contribution from Lu’An. Different business mix caused volume to have a positive impact on sales, but minimum impact on profits. Our costs were $0.46 unfavorable, primarily due to the addition of resources to support our future growth and higher planned maintenance cost. Currency was favorable about $0.35, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB, Euro, British Pound and South Korean Won. Our equity affiliate also had strong underlying business results, adding $0.23 with several joint ventures reporting stronger medical oxygen sales. Non-operating income was $0.16 favorable primarily due to lower pension expense. Interest expense was $0.12 favorable due to the $5 billion of debt to support our future growth projects. Our effective tax rate of 18.9% was roughly equal to last year, and we expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2022. Now please turn to Slide 17 for a brief discussion on our fourth quarter results. Compared to last year, sales increased 22% to more than $2.8 billion. Volume, price, energy pass-through and currencies were all up. Volume improved 9% as strong hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets more than offset reduced Lu’An contributions. Prices were up again with improvement in all three regions. This is the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gains. Overall, prices were up 3% in total, which equaled a 6% increase for the merchant business. We experienced significantly higher energy costs in our merchant business this quarter. The situation is particularly challenging in EMEA due to the extremely high natural gas and electricity costs. Our on-site business, about half of our total company sales has contractual protection from energy costs fluctuations. We are actively executing additional price actions across product lines to recover the higher entry costs impacting our merchant business. EBITDA declined 11% exceeding $1 billion mark, a favorable volume, price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset higher cost. EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points, primarily due to higher energy pass-through, which negatively impacted margin by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales were up 9%, supported by 5% stronger volume and 1% higher price. EBITDA grew 7% sequentially as better volume, price and equity affiliate income more than offset higher energy costs. Now please turn to Slide 18, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.51 which is $0.32, or 15% above last year. Volume was favorable $0.19, and price, net of variable costs contributed $0.04, as our price increases exceeded variable cost inflation, driven by higher power costs. Like the prior few quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support growth have increased our costs. We also saw higher costs due to disruptions across the supply chain in all three regions. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.06, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and British Pound. Equity affiliate income added $0.09 on strong underlying business results. The $0.04 of non-operating income was primarily driven by lower pension expense. The effective tax rate of 18.1% was 130 basis points higher than last year, due to the last years higher share based compensation benefits, and a tax benefit associated with the PBF acquisition. Now please turn to Slide 19, the stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12-months, we generated about $2.7 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12 per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.9 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note, that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters, which is essentially now complete. From the distributable cash flow, we paid $0.45 or about $1.3 billion as dividends to our shareholders, and still have about $1.4 billion available for high return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployments. Slide number 20, provides an update of our capital deployment. As we discussed last quarter, we've extended our time horizon another five years to fiscal 2027. We see tremendous project opportunities beyond 2022, and the investment potential far exceeding the original capacity of $15 billion. Based on this updated view, we see our capital deployment potential reaching approximately $34 billion through fiscal 2027. The $34 billion includes roughly $10 billion of cash, and additional debt capacity available today, almost $17 billion, we expect to be available by 2027. And about $7 billion already spent. We still believe this figure is conservative, given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow and therefore additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current, targeted AA2 rating. So you can see we have already spent 21% and have already committed 67% of the updated capacity we show here. I should note, that this is as of September 30th, so does not reflect the closing of the Jazan Phase1, but does include the Louisiana project. Before I turn the call back to Seifi, I would like to share with you that we plan to reorganize our reporting segments, starting in Q1 of FY ‘22. Our EMEA segment will be separated into Europe, and a Middle East and India segment to reflect the addition of a significant Jazan project in the Middle East segment, and to provide more visibility for our geographic regions. In addition, our Global Gases and corporate segment will be combined. We will provide historical resegmented financial information before the year-end. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Melissa. Now please turn to Slide number 21 for our Asia results. Sales increased 6% compared to last year, on 5% favorable currencies and 1% positive price increase, the 18th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in this region. Volumes were flat with new plans mostly outside of China, offsetting the lower Lu’An contribution. Regarding Lu’An, there is no change from the previous updates that we have given you. The plant continues to operate at full capacity, despite the coal shortage in China. As I said last quarter, and there's an interim supply agreement we are recognizing reduced fees to fiscal year ‘22 before we return to the full year fee in 2023. This quarter, China's effort to reduce energy usage and intensity, so called dual control had a modest adverse effect on our results. It reduced some merchant customers demand and caused isolated disruptions in operations. We continue to monitor this developing situation very closely. In the long-term, though, we do see positive growth opportunities, as China continues to focus on reducing its carbon intensity. EBITDA for this region grew 3%, supported by favorable currencies and price. Costs compared unfavorably primarily due to higher variable energy costs, and resources needed to support projects and startups, the timing of China government incentives last year, and the disruption caused by its dual control policy to reduce energy consumption. Sequentially, EBITDA and margins were lower as higher costs more than offset favorable volumes. Price is up, but rounded to zero. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan, to talk about our Americas results. Dr. Serhan?
Samir Serhan: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 22, for a review of our Americas results. Sales increase more than 20% versus last year, and EBITDA posted another double digit gain. Volume grew 3% primarily due to better hydrogen and merchant demand. Although, Hurricane Ida interrupted our U.S. Gulf Coast operations this quarter, our team worked very hard to limit the impact to our business. While most of our merchant products have returned to pre-COVID levels, our hydrogen volume has increased, but has not yet fully recovered. Demand for jet fuel, which consumes more hydrogen on a unit basis compared to gasoline is still lagging. Also, the industry continued to use more light sweet crude, which requires less hydrogen. We are confident in the long-term growth of hydrogen demand, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Price for the quarter was again strong, the 4% gain for the region was equivalent to 10% on the merchant business, Price was better across all major products. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Energy cost pass-through drove a 15% sales increase, with the much higher natural gas prices. EBITDA was 16% ahead of last year, as positive volume, price, better equity affiliate income and lower maintenance costs more than offset higher inflation. EBITDA margin was 230 basis points lower. However, energy costs pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by approximately 500 basis points. In other words, EBITDA margin would have been significantly up excluding energy pass-through. Sequentially, energy pass-through drove margin 250 basis points lower. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon, to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Now please turn to Slide 23, for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region results. Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales jumped 33% versus last year and EBITDA was up 14%. Volume was strong, increasing 14% driven primarily by improved hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets. Our liquid bulk largely recovered from the pandemic, but packaged gases and hydrogen are still below pre-COVID levels. Price increase for the 15th consecutive quarter was higher across most major product lines and sub-regions. The 4% price gain for the region corresponds to a 6% improvement for the merchant business. Consistent with what most consumers and businesses are experiencing, our European business faced unprecedented energy cost escalation this quarter. Supply chain-related interruptions further exacerbated the difficult situation. Our team has done an excellent job coping with these challenges, executing pricing actions and keeping our customers supplied. As Melissa said, our on-site contracts allow us to pass-through the higher energy costs. For our merchant business, we continue to work hard to recover the recent cost increases through additional pricing actions already underway. Currencies were favorable 3%, primarily due to the strong British Pound versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA was up 14% to about $230 million, primarily due to the strong volume, while better price, equity affiliate income and favorable currencies offset most of the energy cost increase. EBITDA margin was down 560 basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 400 basis points. The remaining roughly 150 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, partially offset by favorable equity affiliate income and better volume. Compared to prior quarter, sales climbed 8% primarily due to pass-through, while positive price and volume were offset by unfavorable currencies. Operating income was 3% below last quarter as the positive price and volume were more than offset by higher costs. Meanwhile, EBITDA was 8% higher due to the inclusion of positive equity affiliate income. And as Melissa mentioned, we will separate the current EMEA segment into two segments, Europe and Middle East and India, starting next quarter. Now, please turn to Slide 24, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sales equipment businesses as well as central costs. Sales and profit were up on higher project activities. We continue to add resources to support project development. Please turn to Slide 25, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Corporate segment sales were higher this quarter driven by increased project activities, as we continue to execute multiple large LNG and other projects. But profit was lower on higher corporate costs. Sequentially, sales and profits were better than last quarter. Again, as Melissa said, we will combine global and corporate starting next quarter. Now to provide closing comments, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Simon. Air Products continues to deliver consistent results, despite significant ongoing challenges in the world. Our volumes, price and profit all grew in 2021. Overcoming the pandemic, the storms, supply chain disruptions and rising costs globally, I truly believe that we have become an even stronger company and fully expect to deliver significant earnings growth as the economies around the world recover, and our projects come on the stream. Now, please turn to Slide number 26, for fiscal year 2022, our earnings per share guidance is $10.20 to $10.40, up 15% to 15%, over last year. For quarter one of fiscal year ’22, our earning per share guidance is $2.45 to $2.55, up 16% to 20%, over last year. And this include about two months of the Phase 1 of the Jazan project. We see our CapEx at around $5.5 billion to $5 billion for fiscal year ‘22, including approximately $1.5 billion of Phase 1 of the Jazan project. Now, please turn to Slide number 27, we are confident that the security of employment and compensation that we provided to our employees during this difficult pandemic period, positions us very well and very strongly for the future. We demonstrated to our people that devious support them in times of difficulty. We are committed to this approach since the only sustainable, long-term competitive advantage of any company is the degree of commitment and motivation of the people in the enterprise. The strong results and significant milestones we achieved this year are just part of our continued growth. As I said before, Air Products is supported by and supportive of the world’s focus on sustainability. Our customers choose Air Products because they know we can help them to meet their sustainability goals, and we continue to innovate so that we can be a partner on their sustainability journey for the future. The world’s environmental and sustainability challenges are immense, huge issues that need to be addressed. And our growth strategy, which is focused on gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen is designed specifically to address these critical needs. We know that our continued success depends on the expertise, dedication, and commitment of our talented people around the world. And we consistently have been adding resources around the world, in order to position ourselves properly to meet the growth demand and the execution of the projects that we have undertaken. Rising through the energy challenges that face our world today, we are committed to having a diverse workforce, significant development of applications and mega project expertise, and collaborative spirit within our companies. I believe Air Products is uniquely positioned to help develop world transition to a cleaner and better future. It's a better future we believe in, and in which, we are already totally invested. Now, we are pleased to answer any questions that you have.
Operator:  We’ll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Seifi, you had a couple of –
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, David.
David Begleiter: Good morning. Thank you. You had a couple of delays in your projects, most notably NEOM and Indonesia by roughly a year. Can you just talk about why those projects are being pushed out by year?
Seifi Ghasemi: David, I wouldn't call them delays. I mean, these are mega projects. And we announced them to give our best judgment about them, they come on stream, but all of these projects need to be permitted. They need government approvals and all of that. So, each time we had a call to give you our latest estimate of what we think these projects can come on stream. So, right now, our best estimate for these projects are the days that we have given you. If we can move them forward, we will tell you. If there's further delays, we will let you know, because as I said, we cannot forecast everything, because we are dependent on getting significant permits for a lot of these projects.
David Begleiter: Understood. And just on the CapEx increase ex- Jazan, can you just talk about the pieces of that $5 million to build out increase? How much is maybe Alberta, how much is Louisiana, et cetera? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I'll bet on Louisiana I’m not going to consume a huge amount of capital next year. But it is all related to the projects that Dr. Serhan mentioned. I mean, people focus on our mega projects, and obviously, we are delighted to talk about it. But don't forget, we still have a base business, which is very resilient, and we are doing many, many, many projects. Actually, as Dr. Serhan mentioned, last year was a record year for our small and mid-sized projects. We are getting our fair share of the market on those projects, they are going away going to be executed, and they require capital.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, David.
Operator: Our next question from John McNulty with BMO.
John McNulty: Thanks for taking my question. So Seifi, with the huge spike in energy prices that you saw over in Europe, and I imagine maybe even a little bit in Asia as well. I guess, can you speak to how quickly you can offset it with regard to prices, something where look, you automatically kind of immediately put it all in? Or, is it something that has to ease in over the next few quarters? I guess, how should we be thinking about that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. John, as you know very well, we have two parts to our business, on the on-site, they immediately growing, because that's just pass-through. Our merchant side and packaged gases business, some of it as clauses, but a lot of it don't have clauses. And therefore, we need to go and increase prices and invoice the customers and convince them that energy prices have gone up. And then there is a competitive environment. Some people have tried to use this as an excuse to get market share and all that. So we need work to do. But what has compounded our issue in terms of being able to recover them fast enough is that the rate of energy increases. I mean, if energy increases, we do forecast of these things. But what happened in Europe, in the month of August and September, was something that it was impossible to forecast that things would go up to 100%. So as a result, we’re lagging in terms of price increases in our merchant business, especially in Europe, but the team is doing a fantastic job. They did a great job in September and October, but there is more work to be done. So we will be delayed about a quarter maybe.
John McNulty: Got it. So a quarter to kind of catch up on that. Okay. And then, I guess when thinking about your margin target where you expect to get the margins back up to kind of that 40% range, give or take, admitting that the rest of it really is more energy pass-through and isn't really a reflection of the business. I guess, can you speak to the timing of when you think you can get there? Is it something where we can kind of see the margins approaching that type of a level by the end of 2022? Is it going to take longer than that? I guess, and what are some of the measures that you really have to kind of enact in order to get back to those 40% type level?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, as far as I'm concerned, I like to see those margins back then, next time we talk in January. I mean, we don't like to see our margins go down. Therefore, the pricing actions that we put in place has a lot to do with that, because it's all about that -- the margins are all about pricing. The volumes are the volumes. The margin is how much profit you made per unit of volume. So we need to catch up with the energy costs. And our goal is to catch up with it as soon as possible. So, then you say my target is to be able to report that our margins have gone back up to 40% by next quarter or the quarter after that. How much of it be achieved is obviously going to depend on the efforts of all of us over here, but we are doing our best to get there as soon as we can. And we are also increasing book for that spirit, absolutely.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
Operator: We'll go to our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning, Seifi. Just to follow-up on the previous question, can you talk about the level of price increases that you're seeking today in various regions to keep up with this energy inflation? And do you think that pace of realization could differ versus history?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Kevin. What it means is that, obviously, the pace of price increases you have seen what we have done in the past, it's about 18th, 19th consecutive quarters that we're getting -- for our merchant business, we are getting 3%, 4%, 5% price increases in different regions around the world. So now, before we begin increasing prices to improve our margins, now we have to increase prices to maintain our margins. And therefore, there is a significant sense of urgency on that. And how successful we are, we are going to report that to you next quarter. I don't want to forecast that, because there is a lot of activities that we do and a lot involved. But the fact is that energy prices have gone up. And we need to recover that by increasing prices. Everybody needs to do that. And there is global inflation. And if people can deal with that, they are going to see their margins go down. And at the same time, we need to also continue to work on our productivity goals. And our people know that, and we are all very focused on that, Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you for that. And Seifi, I wanted to ask your opinion on a high level question related to clean hydrogen. One can look at this business and recognize it's got vastly different growth potential than, say atmospheric gases and different capital requirements, different technology, discrete assets, et cetera. And you could look at multiples for, let's say, lithium producers or other high growth businesses, and they're quite high today. And so, that might argue for separating the business at some point in time. On the other hand, you've got a lot of benefits of integration, including inexpensive costs of capital and a high quality balance sheet. So, as you consider all of those things, how do you think about how the business might develop over time, and whether or not will remain within the portfolio on an integrated basis for the long-term?
Seifi Ghasemi: Kevin, you are asking me a very intelligent question. And my answer to that is that our commitment is to create value for our shareholders. If, at some point in time, what you are suggesting is a significant opportunity for significantly increasing shareholder value, we would obviously consider that. But I don't want to give the impression that we want to do anything tomorrow. And besides that, we need to kind of demonstrate the success of the hydrogen business and all of that. So the question that you're asking is a very good question. And we, as a company, as a board, always look at those options. Now, when we would act or if the act on it, it depends on the circumstances, depends on the market, depends on the development of the hydrogen business, and all of that. So, sorry to give you a general answer, Kevin, but I'm sure you appreciate what I'm saying.
Kevin McCarthy: I do, and sorry for putting you on the spot there. But, certainly welcome those thoughts. Much appreciated.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go to our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Just wanted to drill into your guidance a little bit. If I understood it correctly, and Jazan is in the 2022 guide, if you back out that 11-months' worth, it seems like kind of a mid-single digit EPS guide. Is there anything that you are expecting that is a particular headwind in the year? Or, are you just being conservative here?
Seifi Ghasemi: Steve, first of all, good morning, and thanks for your question. I'm very happy that you're breaking it down the way that you are breaking it down. We are showing that, first of all, I think we should get credit for Jazan. At the end of the day, that's part of the company and we're increasing the EPS 15%. But if you want to look at this asset by saying, okay, I know you have done that, but the base business looks like is growing 6%. Well, that is the baby seat award right now, because the base business, Kevin, as you know better than I do, is dependent on the growth of GDP or industrial production. And I'm not sitting here getting too excited about prospects of GDP or industrial production growth anywhere in the world. I mean, everybody likes to say that COVID is over now everything is growth. China, the biggest growth engine that the world had last quarter grew only 3%. Europe, GDP and industrial production is not going anywhere. In the U.S., not that much happening. And Latin America is not going anywhere. So I think between the circumstances, and then considering all of the issues about energy costs, and then -- that we need to recover all of the issues that is related to supply chain, which is affecting our ability to move helium containers around the world, that's a real issue. And then all of the fundamental supply chain that I mentioned, and the overall economic activity, these are all real issues. Our job is to give you a guidance that is reasonable. We gave you a guidance for fiscal year 2021, the average of that was 902.5, and we delivered 902, despite the hurricanes, which we didn't forecast, despite the power outages and all of that. It's our job to have a balance. We know the business very well. It's our job to look at growth things, look at the other things and put it all together and give you the best judgment that we have at the time to give it to you. And right now, our best judgment is that yeah, you're right, that overall our base business is going to grow about 6% or 7%. I hope it does better. But we are responsible for giving you a responsible forecast, rather than daydreaming about the fact that everything will be fine. And COVID hasn't gone away either. So, sorry to give you a long answer. But, I hope that helps.
Steve Byrne: It does. Thank you, Seifi. And I did want to ask you a question about your blue hydrogen outlook. When we drill into the Alberta and Louisiana projects, it seems to us that a majority of the capital is really to produce incremental hydrogen supply more so than it is for carbon sequestration or capture. And if that's a fair assumption, what in your view is the key driver for that outlook for needing incremental hydrogen supply in these regions? And is it driven by renewable fuel?
Seifi Ghasemi: Kevin, there is two fundamental dynamics. We are talking here about 2020, the time that – yes, 2026 when these projects are going to come on stream. Number one, we do need increase hydrogen demand on the pipeline, because we have new customers that are coming on. And foresee ourselves sold out on that and therefore we need additional hydrogen and the pipeline. The second thing is that we think there will be significant additional customers if you can give them blue hydrogen, and they will convert and get the benefits. But then a significant part of their production, especially in Canada is going to be liquid, which is going to go for mobility where we see people converting to hydrogen for their mobility and the program they have. Then in Louisiana, the massive amount of hydrogen that we are making, a significant part of that or part of that we haven't given you the details until we figured out all of the details, but fundamentally, a significant amount will be converted to blue ammonia, which will be exported. And you know where the destination of that export is, that's basically in Japan, where they have no other choice. But how is Japan going to decarbonize? They don't have oil, they don't have gas, they don't have nuclear. And they don't have shallow waters to do any kind of wind mills offshore. So they need to import their energy. And the best form of energy to import is import blue ammonia, that the co2 has been captured, and to burn it in their power plants to generate electricity, so that then they can use that electricity to drive their cars and all. So, that is the thinking that we have in terms of the outlet for the blue hydrogen.
Steve Byrne: Very good. Yeah. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go to our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer: Dr. Serhan talked about 2021 being a record year for the investment kind of in that mid-size CapEx for you guys. So when we look at that, roughly how accretive is that to ‘22 and ‘23 going forward? Is that significantly a bigger jump than normal? Or how should we figure that into our model?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it seems to be accretive as we go forward. I mean, all of those projects that he's talking about take two or three years to build. So if ’21, we got the project, so it will be ’22, ‘23, it starts having an impact on our results in ’24, ‘25. Those things are not that something that you turn it on right away. They still need to be engineered and built. But he's absolutely correct that we had a very good year on those mid-size projects. We don't usually talk about that, but we decided to talk about it this quarter, because I was just getting concerned that people are under the impression that the only thing they like is mega projects. No, we are committed to our existing business. And we are getting more than our fair share of the existing business on the smaller size. And our people are doing a great job in getting those projects and executing them.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Seifi you had made a comment that there was some disruption in your business in China in particular. Was that power being cut off to your plants? Was that power being cut off to your customers where they couldn't run? Can you break down out a little bit more, how were you impacted where you had to shut down your operations there?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all -- and let me just characterize it, those disruptions in the fourth quarter was not material. They weren't that much. We felt obligated to mention them because there were a few incidents, but they were not material. Now, are they going to be material in this quarter or the next quarter? We have to wait and see. And then the other thing is that we have two kinds of business, as you very well know. We have the on-site business, the on-site business we did only shut down our plant if the customer is forced to shut down. Let's say, it’s a steel plant, and they say shut down the steel plant, the customer doesn't need the oxygen, they have to shut down the power plant. Then we have our merchant business, our merchant business, we rarely every shut down our merchant business, because we are not a dirty business. So they don't specifically say shut down the ASU. It's mainly the customers that they shut down, which affects us.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Duffy.
Operator: We'll go to our next question from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to first start with the blue hydrogen projects that you have announced and using the technologies of ATR and POCs. And I think you commented earlier that there's a competitive advantage of gasification that's at play there. I was hoping if you could talk about that a little bit more, especially after we've heard from peers saying that they too can offer both technologies and even capture 95% of the co2 through SMR?
Seifi Ghasemi: Marc, I'm very happy that you're asking me the question. Because, the blue hydrogen projects that we have announced, we are using new technology in Canada and another technology in Louisiana, when we can capture 95% of the co2 and sequestrating. When it comes to the SMR, what happens in SMR? When you take the natural gas, you have a steam methane reformer. You take some of the natural gas directly into the process, goes over a catalyst, and you break down CH4 to CO on hydrogen, and then you shift, it you have hydrogen and CO becomes CO2, and it goes up at the atmosphere. You can capture 95% of that, true. But then you use a lot of the natural gas to burn to heat up the tubes, which contain the catalyst, that is combustion, like a combustion in a furnace, or in a power plant. Theoretically, you can capture that CO2, but it will cost you an arm and a leg to capture that. So, making a statement that I can capture 95% of the CO2 from SMR, sure, you can capture the CO2 is air too. But the issue is that is it cost effective or not. So what we are saying is that the technology that we have makes it possible to capture the CO2 in a cost effective way. But, yeah, you have to put a lot of equipment on the SMR to capture the CO2 from combustion. Theoretically, you can say, yeah, I can put a special boxes and do that. And I really don't want to comment on what our competitors say, they have to defend what they say, it's their business. But from our point of view, when we put carbon capture on SMRs, as we have done, and we actually operate the biggest plant in Port Arthur, everybody can go and take a look at it. We have the CO2 capture on the process spot, because that is economical, we can capture that and use it for the natural recovery. But on the combustion part, we don't do that, because that becomes cost prohibitive. Can it be done? Yeah, sure, anything can be done at the cost. I hope that helps, Marc.
Marc Bianchi: That's helpful. Thank you, Seifi. Earlier Dr. Serhan mentioned, I think, some increased confidence on NEOM versus last year. I'm curious what's behind that that statement? Is there anything to say about perhaps customers being signed up? Or what's driving that statement?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'll have Dr. Serhan answer that, but he's not going to make any comments about customers. But he will tell you why he feels better about the project as compared to before. Dr. Serhan?
Samir Serhan: Thanks, Seifi. As we communicated before, this is really our first mover project in this world-scale for production of green hydrogen. And I can tell you, we have around maybe 30 different work streams going in parallel in developing, optimizing, producing products, improving the cost. And that's really where this additional confidence is coming that we really feel that we have a very good solution, very, very competitive. And we are targeting for 2026 that means to have it on stream. We will be competitive, very low carbon intensity. And it really meets the specifications that are being imposed in the different countries in the world.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Dr. Serhan. Yeah, thank you. Okay, I hope you've got your answer, Marc. Okay.
Marc Bianchi: Yes, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go to our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, good morning. This is actually Mike here, sitting in for Bob. Just curious, is there a scenario where Lu’An could return to full fees before ‘23? And then, I guess on the other hand, what is the likelihood that that production could become permitted?
Seifi Ghasemi: I understood the first part of your question, and that thing is that the agreement that we have -- the plant is running at full capacity. The agreement we have with them in terms of structure of the fees and so on that is not going to improve in 2022 versus what we have right now. It will improve in 2023. The second part of your question, I wasn't sure I heard it, because you got this -- there was a disruption on what you said. Can you just repeat the second part?
Unidentified Analyst: Oh, I’m sorry. Yeah, the second part was, is there a possibility or likelihood that that reduction could become permanent?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we don't anticipate that. Oh, you mean that in 2023, Lu’An comes and says you were charging me reduced fee, continue doing that. Well, that's not our agreement. That's not our agreement. I don't want to anticipate what Lu’An will do and what we would do in that case. But right now, we don't expect that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. John, your line is open, please check your mute button. Due to no response, we'll go to our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Vincent. How are you doing?
Vincent Andrews: I'm very well. Thank you, Seifi. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on in the long-term, not obviously, where things are today. But, if you think in the medium to long-term, what you think the cost of carbon is going to be? And maybe on a regional basis, you could talk about it. And to the extent you want to discuss what you're assuming when you think about looking at a new project that might be helpful too?
Seifi Ghasemi: Vincent, you're asking a very, very insightful question. I mean, right now, different parts of the world have put different numbers in place. I mean, in California, they have put $200 per ton of CO2, you get an incentive for that. Canada is talking about $50 to $100 per ton. Other parts of the world that we have exposure to that, if the number is somewhere between $100, $50, $75, $150, it's all over the place. I think that the way we look at these projects, and all of that, we try to kind of look at the profitability, on the basis that we don't get too much of these kinds of things, because we don't want to rely on governments of subsidies every time to do something. But overall, these numbers are all going to develop based on the commitments that people have made. And fundamentally, what is going to happen, Vincent, if people are going to -- I see that a great deal of fascination, all of these promises being made at Glasgow. But if you add up all of those things, the amount of carbon credits that you need in order to meet the requirements becomes gigantic. And therefore, in order to generate those things, customers need to start using these low carbon energy sources. And therefore, you have to have real incentives for people to convert from diesel, for ships and trains, and planes, and all of that, and steelmaking to really shift to clean energy. And that one, a little bit of incentive is not going to do that. So, I think if the governments are serious to achieving those goals, they have to put in steep incentives to incentivize people to actually do that. So, the prospect of that is very encouraging for our business, but we have to see how it develops, Vincent, as we go forward.
Vincent Andrews: I appreciate that answer. And, yes, thank you very much. In the interest of time, I'll pass it along.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Vincent. I really appreciate that. Next question?
Operator: We'll go to our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Seifi, I was looking at your project commitments, and I didn't see any commitments in the electronics area through 2026. Is that something strategic where Air Products is moving away from the electronics area in favor of other opportunities? And when you look at your $4.5 billion or so in CapEx for next year, can you talk about what the big chunks that you're going to spend?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, good morning, first of all. Jeff, one of the reasons that we wanted Dr. Serhan to talk about smaller facilities and all of that, was because my concern about the fact that the question that you just asked, we are winning our fair share of business in electronics, we are doing some very big projects for people like all of these big electronic manufacturers, like Intel, like Samsung, like TSMC, and all of that. You don't see it, you don't highlight them, because they are not mega projects, but we are getting our fair share of those. So, we are not -- that is actually one of the sectors we are very focused on. We are very strong in Asia Pacific, where most of these projects are happening. And we are definitely on top of that. Now, in terms of the breakdown, I've been hesitant to give you the breakdown, because then people know exactly which projects we projects we have involved, and all of that. But believe me, Air Products has been and continues to be extremely focused on the electronics sector. And I can claim that we are definitely winning our fair share of those projects for those big customers.
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Sure.
Operator: We'll go to our next question from PJ. Juvekar with Citi.
PJ. Juvekar: Yes. Thank you. Seifi, I’ll ask one quick question. What's happening globally, we look at the narrative about COP26 in a move towards decarburization, and less investments in fossil fuels. Do you see a scenario where fossil fuel prices just keep going up as a result, similar to what has happened in Europe? And if that does happen, hypothetically, how do your projects in China and other parts of the world fare in an environment of higher energy prices? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, PJ, thank you very much for asking a very excellent question. The thing is that there is no question that if hydrocarbon prices go up, like the oil price having gone up, that does help some of the existing projects that we have in China. I mean, right now, one of the reasons that Lu’An is operating at full capacity, despite the very high price of coal in China is because -- what are they doing, they are taking coal, and they are making diesel. And they are selling the diesel fuel at higher prices, because the oil price is $84 a barrel. So in a roundabout way, if hydrocarbon costs go up, it helps those kind of projects. But then the other interesting part is that if hydrocarbon costs go up, then the cost of renewable energy compared to hydrocarbons becomes even more attractive. So you would say that it's easier to convert a truck driver from diesel to hydrogen, because now the diesel is costing more. So in a funny way, if actually hydrocarbon prices go up, it will help our strategy in terms of focusing on renewables. Does that make sense, PJ?
PJ. Juvekar: Yes, that does. But does it impact your coal gasification plants?
Seifi Ghasemi: But it helps them, because the coal gasification plants are producing chemicals, which are competing the production from oil. I mean, the whole reason that China is using a lot of coal, or Indonesia wants use a lot of coal or India wants to use coal is because they want to use coal to produce chemicals, so that they don't have to pay foreign currency for the oil that they import. So, if energy prices go up, coal prices are in the ground, therefore that would help.
PJ. Juvekar: I'll pass it along. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Any other questions or that’s --
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. With that, then I would like to thank everybody who was on the call. We very much appreciate your very good and insightful and sometimes difficult questions, but that's the way it is. We do appreciate that. And we look forward to talking to you when we announce our first quarter results, sometime in January or early February. Thank you again, and have a very nice day.
Operator: That does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-08-09 08:30:00) =====

Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. And good day to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. Today, in addition to announcing our results, we do have a significant announcement that is updating our plans for growth and capital deployment. But before we get into the details, I would like to say a few awards about our CFO transition, which we announced last month. Please turn to slide number 3. Following this call, Ms. Melissa Schaeffer will succeed Mr. Scott Crocco as our Chief Financial Officer and assume leadership responsibility for our worldwide finance organization. Scott is retired from Air Products on September 30th as part of the smooth transition. Today, I'm going to recognize and thank Scott, who has had a distinguished 31-year career with Air Products. Scott started in our career development program, and ultimately progressed to the highest role in finance, serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. That achievement is a testament to Scott particularly his strong work ethic, his drive to deliver, and his focus on creating shareholder value. Scott, I would like to say publicly what I have told you privately, that it has been a privilege working with you for these past 7 years, particularly as we have executed our growth strategy and onboard class projects in gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen. These projects continue to differentiate the Company and position Air Products for significant growth into the future. Particularly, I want to thank you for leading our efforts to position us for the successful closing of the Jazan Gasification and Power Project and your efforts related to the project financing of this significant investment. I appreciate all you have done to help us move forward. And I wish you great health and happiness in the future. Thank you again for all you have done for Air Products. Scott, at this point, would you like to say a few words?
Scott Crocco: Yes. Thank you very much, Seifi. I appreciate the kind words and the support and the leadership you've provided over these past 7 years. It's been an honor to work alongside you and the rest of the leadership team to set Air Products on a path where the sky truly is the limit. With strong cash flows, significant capital deployment capacity, and continued dividend increases, Air Products operates from a position of strength. And I have no doubt there will be many more profitable growth opportunities ahead. I remain excited about the future of this amazing Company. Melissa and I've worked closely together over the past few years, and there is no doubt you will continue to excel and help others to do the same. I look forward to continuing the transition with her over the coming weeks. And again, thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. I do appreciate your comments. Let me now introduce Melissa Schaeffer. One of the things that you will learn right away about Melissa is that she is a passionate and driven individual. For Melissa, it's all about excellence. She is driven to win. Along with that spirit, she brings deep leadership and financial experience, from inside and outside Air Products to this new role. She is a great example of the culture that we're building here, and I have no doubt she will continue to create an environment that people belong and matter, and contribute to their fullest. And this shall help financial roles of increasing responsibility to Zemin's, Ernst & Young, and Trinseo before coming to Air Products. She joined us as Vice President and Chief Audit Executive in 2016, she then became our Vice President of Finance, financial responsibility for our megaprojects, as well as Air Products' largest reporting segment. Melissa has been a key part of our growth and success over the past five years. And I'm delighted she will be our Chief Financial Officer. Melissa, would you like to say a few words?
Melissa Schaeffer: Thank you for the time and introduction Seifi. And I want to thank Scott for the tremendous example he has set as our CFO. I appreciate the opportunity to join the earnings call today, and say hello to all of you. And I look forward to meeting more of the investment community and sharing Air Products Q4 and full-year results with everyone on our next call. Air Products is truly at the heart of providing energy and environmental solutions which makes this Company a truly special place to be. I'm looking forward to our finance organization and our broad Air Products team working together to bring those sustainable growth solutions forward. To serve our customers, support our communities, and of course, reward our shareholders. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you both, Scott and Melissa, for your comments. And now, let's turn to our business results. The stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display as the talented and committed people at Air Products delivered good results again this Quarter. Our people working together have kept our 750 facilities around the world operating and our customers supplied through the COVID-19 pandemic. In support of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by our employees, we have not reduced our staff or cut salaries during this difficult period. I am proud to say that Air Products is emerging from this crisis and even stronger Company than before. We have continued to acquire new assets and businesses, successfully raised prices, and brought new plans on stream. We have also strengthened our organization by adding resources in various functions, mostly in engineering and project development to help us successfully pursue and execute the many exciting future projects we have in front of us. At the same time, we also delivered Earnings per Share of $2.31 this Quarter, which is 15% higher than last year despite absorbing costs related to our growth-driven development efforts. I am extremely proud of the accomplishments that we have achieved as a team, and I would like to thank all of our employees at Air Products for their dedication and hard work. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results while maintaining our unwavering focus on safety. As slide number 4 shows, despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers, and our communities. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents. Slides number 5, 6, and 7 include our goal, our management philosophy, and our 5-point strategic plans. We have seen this before, and these are the principles that we will follow every day and they will continue to guide us in the future. Now, please turn to slide number 8. We believe the environmental sustainability challenges facing the board are significant. The scope and complexity of the mega projects necessary to address these challenges require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team. As I mentioned earlier, we can solve these problems no matter how challenging as long as we all stay focused and united, working towards a common goal on a global basis. We believe this is the calling of our Company and the higher purpose for all of us at Air Products. We can all please turn to slide number 9. We recently published an annual sustainability report which highlights our sustainability-driven growth opportunities and our many accomplishments in this area. For instance, our products help our customers avoid 72 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions. This means that for every ton of CO2 that we emit in making our products, we help our customers avoid 3 tons of CO2 emissions. In addition, more than 1/2 of our offerings are sustainable, and close to 1/4 of our electricity purchases are from renewable sources. We have also set new sustainability goals which are very much aligned with our growth strategy. Our 3rd by 30 goal aims to reduce carbon intensity by 1/3 by 2030. Our growth opportunities have enabled progress towards this goal. And therefore, we expect to see significant progress later in the decade as our major projects come on stream and start to positively benefit our results. At Air Products, sustainability is our growth strategy. Hence, sustainability and our growth go hand-in-hand. As we strive to solve the world's environmental sustainability problems, we are also creating growth opportunities for the Company. A prime example of such an opportunity is the innovative, world-class, net-zero hydrogen project in Edmonton, Alberta that we announced last June, and I will talk about a little more later on. Now, please turn to slide number 10, which highlights our key gasification projects. We are committed to our gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future. Now, specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 large gasification projects which I have discussed on previous earning calls. First, our $12 billion acquisition of Jazan Gasifier and Power Plant from Saudi Aramco. We continue to make significant progress working with our partners and the lenders. The team has worked hard to bring the project through the final stages of project financing and we still expect this project to reach final financial close by the end of our fiscal year that is 09/30/2021. Second, regarding Lu'An, the plant is operating at full capacity. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to recognize reduced fees through fiscal year '22 before we return to the full fee in 2023. Now, I would like to provide an overview of 2 new and very exciting developments before I discuss the major announcement we are making today, which is our capital deployment plans for the next 6 years. Just on slide 11, you can see the overview of our Beta project that we announced last month. This innovative project includes Gasification, Carbon Capture, and Hydrogen. The 3 pillars of our growth strategy coming together in 1 project, to support the energy transition. This project is fully aligned with Canada's clean energy diversification strategy and enables Canada to advance its competitive, low-carbon economy. It uses locally available hydrocarbons to make net-zero Hydrogen. As summarized on slide 12, the hydrogen will be produced using other thermal reforming technology, enabling 95% of the CO2 produced by the project to be captured then stored. To achieve net zero, the remaining 5% carbon footprint will be upset by exporting the electricity generated by just net-zero hydrogen. The output will supply the output, the net-zero hydrogen will be supplied to our customers on our existing pipeline in Alberta as well as used to produce liquid hydrogen for the mobility and merchant markets. The project represents a 1.3 billion Canadian dollar investment and is expected to come in the stream in 2024. As you can see on slide number 13, we continue to focus on the very exciting hydrogen for the mobility market. And we are pleased to announce a project with Cummins, to accelerate the integration of hydrogen fuel sales trucks globally. Cummins will provide a Hydrogen fuel electric powertrain and integrated it into heavy-duty trucks for Air Products. As we begin the process of converting our global fleet of 2,000 distribution vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We expect the first unit to be online in 2022, and the full conversion before 2030. Now, let me give you the highlights of our significant announcement today. 3.5 years ago, in 2018, we announced publicly that Air Products growth strategy guided by the global energy transition, and based on the 3 pillars of gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen had the potential to create significant growth for our Company, and that we could foresee deploying or committing $15 billion of capital in the 5 years, from 2018 to end of 2022. At that time, I remember clearly about announcement  within the degree of skepticism. Now today, I'm happy to show you as you can see on slide number 14, that we have deployed or committed almost $18 billion of capital, 1.5 years ahead of our plan. And I want to state that on the aggregate, the return on this capital is in line with the guidance we have given our investors before. This validates our long-term strategy. But now that we are ahead of the plan, the question raised by our investors was, "What about the future?" I had promised the investors that we would address this question sometime during the summer of 2021. So here we are today, summer of 2021, announcing as you can see on slide 15 that based on what we see ahead, implementing our 4th focused strategy and based on a conservative estimate of our financial capacity, Air Products expects to deploy or commit more than $30 billion of capital for the 10 years, from 2018 to the end of 2027. Later in this call, Scott will go through the details. But today, I wanted to make the point that as before, we are pursuing a growth strategy. We do have the right strategy to move forward. We are aided by the megatrends of the energy transition. We have the people and the core competencies. And we have the financial strength to make our dream a reality and deliver on what we promised our investors. Now please turn to slide 16, which shows our EPS growth. As you can see, we have delivered greater than 10% annual EPS growth since 2014 when I was appointed Chairman, President, and CEO of the Company. These results are a testament to the hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products and I want to thank them again for their continued hard work and commitment. Now, please turn to slide number 17, a reminder that we share our Earnings growth via our investors. Both our EPS and dividends have grown double-digits since 2014. We are committed to delivering increased dividends while we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividends and our growth strategy. And finally, slide number 18 shows our EBITDA margins. As always, my favorite slide. There it shows that the margins are up 1200 basis points since 2014. Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Scott to provide a financial overview. Scott.
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, the stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic. If we compare our volumes this Quarter to Q3 of Fiscal Year 2019, or in other words, before the pandemic, our volumes are up 8%. Our trailing fourth quarter distributable cash flow has held steady at approximately $2.6 billion for the past 2 years. Now, Air Products is emerging from this pandemic an even stronger Company. Our Sales, EBITDA, and EPS grew double-digits this Quarter. All 3 regions reported higher sales in EBITDA. And our price and volume continued to be strong despite lower earnings from the loan and the ongoing COVID impact. Now, please turn to Slide 19 for a brief discussion of our third-quarter results. Sales increased 26% compared to the prior year, reaching $2.6 billion driven by very strong volume, better pricing, higher energy pass-through, and favorable currencies. Volume improved 12% as COVID recovery, new plants, and acquisitions more than offset reduced Lu'An contributions. Although the pandemic has eased, the volume recovery has not been consistent across our product lines. We continue to experience the negative impact of COVID-19, although the impact this quarter was more modest than last year. Prices were again up with an improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 16th consecutive Quarter of year-over-year price gains. Overall prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 4% increase for the merchant business. EBITDA inclined 11% approaching the $1 billion mark as favorable volume, price, currencies, and equity affiliate income, more than offset higher costs which were impacted by inflation and higher maintenance. EBITDA margin declined 520 basis points primarily due to higher costs and higher energy pass-through, which increases sales but not profit. Higher energy pass-through negatively impacted margin by about 200 basis points. Higher costs included higher maintenance spending compared to last year, due mainly to low spending in the prior year resulting from less access to sites due to the COVID-19. ROCE was 240 basis points lower. The increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt reduced ROCE by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales were up 4% supported by 5% seasonally stronger volume and 1% higher price. Energy pass-through was lower by 2% as energy prices returned to a more normal range following the effects of the winter storm in the previous Quarter. Now please turn to slide 20. Our third quarter, GAAP EPS was $2.36 and included a $0.05 tax benefit primarily resulting from reserve adjustments related to a 2017 tax election on a non-U.S. subsidiary. Excluding the non-GAAP item, our third-quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31, despite the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, and was $0.30 above last year. Volume was favorable at $0.26. COVID recovery, new plants, and acquisitions, more than offset reduced the Lu'An contributions. As a reminder, it's important to recognize that as the 60% majority owner of the Lu'An joint venture, 100% of the negative impact from the Lu'An is included in the volume line because we consolidate the operating results. However, this is partially offset by the positive impact reflected in the non-controlling interest line as the net income shared by our partner is also reduced. Price net of variable costs contributed $0.05 as our price increases more than covered variable cost inflation. We continue to execute pricing actions in response to rising variable costs, such as power and fuel. Like the prior few Quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support growth have increased our costs. America's maintenance costs were lower last year due to COVID-19 limitations, and there were temporary COVID -related government incentives in Asia last year. Currency and Foreign Exchange contributed $0.12 with the Chinese RMB and Euro accounting for roughly 1/2 of the impact. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 on strong underlying business results, while non-controlling interest was also favorable $0.05 on lower profits from our consolidated joint ventures primarily Lu'An. The effective tax rate of 18.2% was 110 basis points lower than last year due to a change in the UK tax law. We expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below 20% in fiscal year '21. The remaining $0.04 includes a favorable $0.05 in non-operating income, primarily driven by lower pension expense and an unfavorable interest expense of $0.01. Now please turn to slide 21.  The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12 per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.8 billion, we paid interest, taxes, and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance Capex is a little higher than usual driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters. From a distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.2 billion as dividends to our shareholders. And we still have about $1.4 billion available for high return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. Slide number 22 provides an update on our capital deployment. As Seifi mentioned, we've extended our time horizon another 5 years to 2027. Since we see tremendous project opportunities beyond the original capacity of $15 billion, we think it's appropriate to extend the timeframe for at least another 5 years. This updated view of our capital deployment potential shows over $30 billion available through fiscal 2027. The $30 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today. Almost $15 billion, we expect to be available by 2027, and almost $7 billion already spent. We believe this figure is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow and therefore, additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current target AA2 rating. As you can see we've already spent at 22% and have already committed 57% over the updated capacity we show here. In short, we exceeded the commitment we made to you in 2018 and have substantial capacity available to deploy to support our growth strategy. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi (ph).
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Scott (ph). Now, please turn to slide number 23 for our Asia results. Sales increased 15% compared to last year supported by a strong volume, better price, and favorable currencies. Volumes were up 6%, reversing the negative trend of the previous 4 quarters. Base volumes, driven by COVID recovering and the addition of numerous small new plants, more than offset the reduced Lu'An contribution. Asia pricing overall was positive 1%, primarily divided -- driven by good performance in China across most product lines. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in Asia. Sequentially, the price was also positive by 1%. EBITDA increased 9% driven primarily by favorable price, volume, currencies, and equity affiliate income. Costs compared  partly using inflation and COVID -related incentives last year. I should say COVID -related government incentives and costs last year. EBITDA margin of 47.4% was 270 basis points lower as reduced Lu'An contribution and increased costs more than offset the benefits of higher price, volume, and equity affiliate income. Operating income and margin compared unfavorably to EBITDA and EBITDA margin due to higher quality affiliate income and additional depreciation from new plants. Sequentially, sales and profit improved as economic activities rebounded following the Lunar New Year holidays. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Scott (ph) to talk about America's results.
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi (ph). Please turn to Slide 24 for a review of America's results. Sales surged 25% over last year. Volume, price, energy pass-through, and currency were all positive. Volume grew 9% primarily due to the COVID recovery, higher medical gases in South America, and one-time items. Most merchant products have returned to their pre-COVID levels but hydrogen volume has not yet fully caught up. While the demand for transportation fuels has improved as people resumed travel, the increases are not even across different types of fuel. Gasoline and diesel volumes have rebounded. However, the demand for jet fuel, which consumes more hydrogen on a per unit basis compared to gasoline, still lags. Furthermore, the industry has shifted to use more light sweet crude, which requires less hydrogen. In addition, the industry's inventory level remained high. Price was again strong. The 4% increase for the region was equivalent to 8% on the merchant business. Price was better across all major product lines. And this is the 12th consecutive Quarter of year-over-year price improvement. Energy cost pass-through was again higher as natural gas prices remained elevated versus last year, and drove the 10% sales increase. EBITDA reached $465 million, a 13% increase over last year as better volume and price, as well as one-time items more than offset power and other cost inflation higher maintenance. Our maintenance costs were unfavorable versus last year because limited maintenance work was possible last year due to the restrictions imposed by COVID protocols. Following the successful completion of the turnaround this Quarter, we expect our maintenance activities to moderate next Quarter. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points, or almost 90% of the reported decline. Compared to last Quarter, America's volumes increased 6% driven by stronger hydrogen volume, partly helped by recovery following the winter storm and one-time items. Price also improved 1%, up across all major product lines. Energy pass-through was lower sequentially as the natural gas price came back down after the spike caused by the winter storm. EBITDA increased 4% sequentially supported by improved volume and price, as well as one-time items, while costs were unfavorable. EBITDA margin was 120 basis points better, primarily driven by about 350 basis points of favorable energy pass-through, while strong price partially offset higher costs. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide 25 for a review of our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region results. Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales jumped 45%, and volume and EBITDA were both up about 25% versus last year. COVID recovery and acquisitions primarily drove the 24% volume increase. Our liquid bulk business has returned to its pre-COVID level, but the packaged gas business still lagged. Price increase for the 14th consecutive Quarter and was higher across most major product lines and all the sub-regions. The 1% price gain for the region corresponds to a 2% improvement for the merchant business. Real price increases were partially offset by an unfavorable mix since the demand across the product lines was not even. We are also executing additional pricing actions to recover the recent power cost increases. Currencies were a favorable 12%, primarily due to the strong Euro and British pound versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA was up 25% to over $210 million, driven primarily by the strong volume. EBITDA margin was down 540 basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 200 basis points. The remaining roughly 300 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, mostly power and other cost inflation. Compared to the prior quarter, sales rose 7% primarily supported by a positive 5% volume. But EBITDA was down 2% and the margin was about 300 basis points lower, as this volume gain was more than offset by higher costs including power and other cost inflation and lower equity affiliate income Now, please turn to Slide 26, Global Gases, which includes our non - LNG sale equipment businesses, as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sales of equivalent and project activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending. Sales and profits were roughly equal to last Quarter. Please turn to Slide 27, Corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses, as well as our corporate costs. We were pleased to be selected for Nigeria LNG's Train 7 Project building on the success of the Air Products ' LNG equipment and technology for the first 6 trains. Corporate segment sales were higher this Quarter driven by increased project activities as we continued to execute multiple large LNG and other projects, but profit was lower on higher corporate costs, and sales and profits were roughly equal to last Quarter. Now, to provide some additional thoughts, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Simon. Now, please turn to Slide number 28. Air Products continues to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow. Our on-site business, which is awfully 1/2 of our total sales, remains stable. We have seen signs of improvement in merchant volumes, particularly relative to the very challenging Quarter 3 last year. As I mentioned earlier, the Lu'An facility is operating at full capacity, and we expect the Jazan transaction to achieve financial close by the end of September 2021. For Quarter 4 of the fiscal year 2021, our Earnings per share guidance is $2.44 to $2.54 up 11% to 16% over last year. This makes our guidance for our fiscal year be 895 to 905, up approximately 8% over last year, and within the range, we shared with you last Quarter. We continue to see our Capex of approximately 2.5 billion for the year 2021. Our fiscal year '21 EPS and Capex guidance excludes any contribution from just  Meanwhile, we continue to execute our other projects, bringing them on a stream and finalizing agreements with our customers. We are committed to our capital deployment strategy and to growing our pipeline of projects. We continue to be very optimistic about our focused, long-term growth strategy. The capital deployment projections that we shared with you today for the next 6 years demonstrate our significant growth potential in the years to come. Now, please turn to Slide number 29. The only sustainable long-term competitive advantage of any Company is the degree of commitment and motivation of the people in the enterprise. We are fortunate to have that commitment with our people. By working together against the hardships of the pandemic, supporting our customers and each other, I am proud to say that we have made our even stronger in the process. Not only have we continued to strengthen our base business, but also further extend our core competencies, pursuing our growth strategy. Our gasification, Carbon capture, and Hydrogen growth platforms all support the drive for a cleaner environment. And we are executing mega escape projects in all three areas.

Now, we are very pleased to answer any questions that you have.
Operator: Thank you. . If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment.  And our first question, we'll hear from Vincent Andrew with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to Scott. A very well done and distinguished career, clearly. Seifi, could I ask you on the new outlook for capital allocation, maybe 2 pieces about it. How are you thinking about how much of it will be in that mega-project category that we've seen with NEOM and so forth versus the more traditional industrial gas projects?  And second to that is I think back over the last 3.5 years of the first CapEx outlook, the menu of things you're interested in expanding into gasification, and then we got into green and blue hydrogen and now, carbon capture.  I would assume that we're going to see the future CapEx skew more towards those ladder categories. But I'm also curious whether there's anything else that's on the horizon that's not currently on the Capex menu that we should start thinking about.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Vincent, and thank you very much for your comment about Scott. He's a great guy. We all know that.
Scott Croccoi: Yes, thank you. I really appreciate it.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. With respect to your specific question Vincent (ph), out of the additional $12 billion that we announced in the next 6 years, we expect about 5 billion to be in support of our existing business, and the balance of it being the large projects. And in terms of the focus, we are going to stay very focused, Vincent, and spend our money on gasification, hydrogen, which is blue and green, and CO2 capture. We are going to try not to venture too much outside of those three specific areas. And its significant opportunity.  Now that you asked the question, it gives me -- we came up with the $30 billion, not because of lack of projects. It is because we wanted to demonstrate what is our financial capacity to maintain our A rating. As we go forward, obviously, we cannot project your EBITDA for 2030. So that's why we are constrained. There are a lot of projects in the areas of gasification, hydrogen, and CO2.  As you can see in the future, and we're going to stay focused on that because I believe by being focused, you get results rather than being all over the place.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Vincent.
Operator: And next, we'll move to Jeff Zekauskas (ph) with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. A two-part question. If you look at your European operations and your Asian operations over the last 3 quarters, they're sequentially flat. The Asian EBITDA is a little bit better. The European EBITDA is not.  Why is that the case, given that the global economy has been improving? And secondly, in your reconciliation tables, in your return on capital, your return on capital has gone from 12.4% a year ago to 10%. It's moved down sequentially. Why is that? What are the factors that you are encountering that are lowering your capital returns?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas: Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: 2 very good questions.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. 2 very good questions. Number 1, when you look at it, say that it is flat, the global economy is improving. Please take note that the global economy is improving and people going to restaurants and flying around. In the major economies that we are operating in, the industrial economy has not improved that much.  That's number 1. The second thing, our results are significantly affected by Lu'An. You know that very well because Lu'An had an EBITDA contribution every year at full capacity under normal circumstances of almost $150, $160 million a year.  When you -- when that number comes down, then it distorts all of the numbers. But please look at our volumes. Another thing is that our results are affected by another significant item which I have mentioned many times before.  We are investing in increased  organizations significantly to develop these new projects. When we enhance in a project like Canada, we have been working on 4 other projects. Each one of these projects cost $4 million or $5 million, $10 billion -- $10 million to develop.  We are spending that money because we are investing for the future. That is taking also hitting our result. But look at our volumes. If you look at our volumes, our volumes are better than all of our competitors during that period. We have grown our base volumes. If you take all of the mumbo jumbos out of other people's results and our results, our volume growth has improved better than anybody else.  It's 12%. So, therefore, I don't  that's number 1. The second thing with respect to their return on capital employed, it depends on number 1, how you calculate it. Because if we can calculate our return on capital employed, the way other people calculate it where they don't consider the cash, we are at 16% not at 10%.  The second thing is our return capital employed has gone down because we borrowed $5 billion that is still sitting on our balance sheet and having deployed that. Once we deploy that, once we pay for the Jazan 2.5 billion, your return on capital employed will jump up.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, good. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: That okay, Jeff?
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Absolutely.
Jeff Zekauskas: Yeah.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we'll move on to John Roberts with UBS.
Josh Spector: Hey, guys. This is Josh Spector on for John this morning. First, just on behalf of the team here at UBS, just want to say congrats to Scott on his retirement. And welcome, Melissa, to the team. Happy to have you here.
Scott Croccoi: Thank you, Josh.
Josh Spector: Going to the -- thanks. Just sticking on the volume point. Within the regions -- with the projects starting up, it's become a little bit tougher to tell where the merchant levels are versus 2019. Could you walk through the different regions and help us understand how much volume you might be lower in aggregate relative to 2019, or in another word, how much recovery is left to get there?  And then second would just be, in some of the one-time items you called out in the Americas, can you quantify what that is or give us some insight on what that is that's benefiting you guys in the quarter? Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Thank you very much. I think that during the course of his comments, Scott mentioned, that if you take our volumes and compare it to pre-COVID, we are 8% ahead in terms of our mentioned volumes. So we are actually, volume-wise, ahead of where we were before the COVID started.  That's one of the previous points that I was making. Then with respect to your second question about the one-time items, we don't want to give too much detail about those because it involves customers and so on, and some of the people don't want to exactly for us to disclose exactly what we set out for them if it's close the refinery or something like that. So I -- apologies for not answering that question.
Josh Spector: Okay, thanks. If I could just try again on the volume side. So on a like-for-like basis, you would say volumes are 8% ahead, that doesn't include a contribution from new projects, or are we mixing up things there?
Seifi Ghasemi: There are new projects, but it is not substantial. Even if you exclude the new projects, we're ahead.
Josh Spector: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. And our best to you, Scott. There were a variety of comments made about the year-over-year comparison. Some of those you would have had visibility on like Lu'An and some of your corporate costs perhaps. But what would you say was most surprising to you on the cost side or that impacted your results in the quarter that were different from your expectations a few months ago?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the expectation that we had was that the U.S. economy on the industrial side especially, would be stronger than it is and especially also, I mean the hydrogen. Those things didn't develop to our expectations. For the rest of it, we did have visibility on that the surprise was the performance in the Americas.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you, Seifi. And one quick one for you on your Helium business, any comments on the outlook for you, particularly given the large Russian project in development, any concerns there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Steve, on that one, you are very knowledgeable about what is going on and the details. There is this big high helium project that the Russians are working on, the so-called Amur Project. And that project has a significant amount of capacity. And when and if, I shouldn't say if. When it comes on a stream, whenever it is, it will obviously change the supply-demand basis in helium worldwide.  And it will have an effect on prices. But we don't know when that is going to be, and that project has been delayed many times. When that happens, it will obviously have an effect. It hasn't happened. They don't expect it to happen next quarter, but it might happen in the future. It is a lot of volume of helium that can come on stream. Is that okay with you?
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we'll move to John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and again congratulations Scott, it's been a pleasure working with you. So a question on the global business and the corporate lines because the revenues keep going up pretty meaningfully. You've got some of the big new LNG, business coming in, and yet the profits year-over-year definitely faded.  So I guess can you give us a little bit more color as to the drivers behind that? And when we might be through that, whether it's incremental costs or expenses on the corporate line and maybe some of the business mixes changes on the global side just because it is a little bit surprised that it seems to be holding back the revenues as much as it has been?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, first of all, good morning. Hope all is well with you. Second thing is that John, we are talking about deploying $30 billion of capital. That means those projects need to get engineered and built before they contribute to the bottom line.  We have added, without exaggeration, close to 2,000 people who are engineering and project management and business development staff in the last 2 years. 2,000 people. If you take $120,000 per person that becomes a lot of money.  They have absorbed a lot of costs because of pricing and all of that but still, we're spending a significant amount of dollars. In order to position ourselves that not only we develop these projects, but that we also execute them and build them.  But then when they do that, people know how to do the math better than anybody else. If we deploy the $30 billion by 2027, which we say we will, and we say that the return on that thing is expected $0.10 operating profit for every dollar, that is $3 billion of operating profit in addition to what we are doing.  You do that after-tax, and then you come up with a significant number with respect to more than $10, $11, $15 per share. In order -- we need to make that a reality; that is not going to happen by itself. And therefore, we are going to be absorbing additional costs in the meantime, not a year from now, 2 years from now, depending on how many projects we have.  Now, if next year, they come and say that look, we are spending 30, now we have to increase it to 40, they really have to add more people. So there is a sequence to this thing. We need to spend the money to develop the project, to get the projects. And as you know, the new rules are such that you cannot put the projects on the balance sheet and then you bend them, and for those that you've bend, you have to eat the cost. That's the accounting rules.  That is where I think the investors need to have a little bit of patience with us because these costs are going to be with us. And quite honestly, it is amazing that the effect is not as much as it could be. Because as I said, 2,000 people, it's costing us $240 million, $250 million a year to support those people. Okay, John?
John McNulty: Sounds fair. Yes. No, fair enough. Very helpful color on it. Thanks a million, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Seifi, over the last several quarters, we've seen inflation accelerate pretty broadly, and a lot of specialty chemical companies are feeling the effects of that in today's market. Air Products, of course, is blessed in that you passed through a lot of costs, but as you've been discussing, I think there are other costs that aren't pass-through.  And so my question would be, do you think there is any need or opportunity to accelerate the pace of pricing given that backdrop of industry inflation, and how might your answer differ by region of the world?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is a very good question, Kevin. First of all, we believe the way we operate is that our base business, people increase prices to cover inflation. That is the minimum we expect them to do. The other cost increases, obviously as I mentioned before, is adding additional resources.  But our philosophy is that if our costs go up, prices need to go up. And as compared to other chemical companies, we have another benefit is that our raw material price doesn't go up because our raw material is via the air, for most of our products.  And if it is natural gas, we do pass it too. Overall, as I've said many times before, with my 42 EBITDA year experience in Industrial gases, inflationary times are, in general, positive for industrial gases because it gives you a license to increase prices. I mean, in our call, we mentioned price increases on an overall basis, but if you take just our nation's price increases. We have had the price increases this last quarter of 7% in Americas, 3% in Europe, 3% in Asia. Total Company 5% price increase for the mentioned side. So that is significant and it's keeping us up to date with inflation. Okay?
Kevin McCarthy: Yeah. Thank you for that.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we'll move on to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Good morning, Seifi. And of course, my congrats to Scott as well. It's been a pleasure. Seifi, just on Jazan. If you do -- if we do assume a financial close by fiscal year-end, should we still presume a full-year of earnings contribution for Jazan in the next Fiscal Year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah. It is going to depend on the details of the final structure of the financing and all of that, but yes. We have said that once we do financial close and we pay a certain amount of money, we are going to get the VFCO, the basic facility in accordance with how much money we have put in. You should expect a good contribution in 2022, yes.
David Begleiter: Very good. And do you have an update on the NEOM and Indonesian projects? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: The NEOM project, we obviously are working on it. We have, I think at least around 400 people working on that project. The project is moving forward. We are clear and preparing the ground. And the engineering is going forward, so we are making progress on that project. With respect to Indonesia, I don't have any updates. Indonesia has a lot of issues there with the COVID and all of that, so I don't really have any updates.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move on to Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning and best wishes to Scott, and congratulations to Melissa on the new role. In terms of America's business, you mentioned they were up sequentially on stronger hydrogen demand. I think that's related to the Texas freeze and some improvement in refinery utilization. You also mentioned that some of these refineries are using more light and swift crude feedstocks which require less hydrogen. Can you talk a little bit more about the longer-term effect of that trend?
Seifi Ghasemi: Right. For the longest term, we are actually very bullish about our hydrogen pipeline in the Gulf Coast. We expect that the hydrogen network to be nearly sold out in about 2 years' time. Because the fundamental drivers for growth are there, the refineries will come back, and it is a significant trend. And Mike (ph), you know, that very well. To work converting the refineries into making renewable diesel. And the, as we have said, the intensity of hydrogen for renewable diesel is higher than other things. We remain very optimistic about that. It's just quarter by quarter, the numbers move, but for the longer term, we are very optimistic about that hydrogen pipeline and that whole infrastructure there.
Mike Harrison: In the EMEA business, you mentioned the higher power costs and the need to go after additional pricing there. Can you just talk about those dynamics a little bit more I guess? Are there some seasonal improvements in the power situation such that if you waited out, maybe the costs will come a little bit lower?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I don't think so. I think that in Europe there is a structural issue that when you decide that you don't want to use nuclear and then you don't want to decide to use coal, then the other alternative sources of energy are more expensive. I mean, in some parts of Europe, energy costs last Quarter were almost 100% more than last year. I think that power cost increases in Europe are going to be a thing of the future. And in order -- and that's why a lot of these things that people talk about making green hydrogen using the grid in Europe is a little bit of a  in the sky. But overall, I think that our job is to increase our prices to compensate for the power costs. And our contracts are structured that way. Sometimes we might get a little bit of a lag in implementing that, but our people know exactly what they need to do. And in time, we will catch up. But I don't think oil prices in Europe are going to ease.
Mike Harrison: Thank you very much, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much. Thank you.
Operator: And Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs will have the next question.
Bob Koort: Thanks very much. On Jazan, Seifi, are the gasifiers running now, so it's just a function of paper shuffling to start accruing the benefits?
Seifi Ghasemi: Bob (ph), good morning. How are you this morning?
Bob Koort: Doing great.
Seifi Ghasemi: You just asked me a question that I cannot answer because we have been prohibited by Saudi Aramco to talk about the state of operation of the refinery and what stage it is, and how it is operating and so on, for security reasons. So I cannot tell you what is operating, what is not operating, and all of that. I mean, if you want, you can ask that question from Saudi Aramco but they can say probably the same things that I said. So I apologize.
Bob Koort: Okay.
Seifi Ghasemi: You asked the question and I cannot answer you. Sorry about that.
Bob Koort: How about on the debt facility that was launched back in May? Is that the final piece that has to be concluded?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is the final piece that needs to be concluded. That is underway, and we are very close.
Bob Koort: Got you. Okay. Thank you, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: -- very, very closely.
Bob Koort: Scott, I've really enjoyed working with you over the years.
Scott Crocco: Thanks, Bob. Likewise.
Operator: Then we move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Thanks. The first question is just around the win. Seifi, I think you mentioned that you thought it was going to get back to a run rate of $150 to $160 million of EBITDA. But I didn't understand was that in Fiscal 2022 for you guys or is that calendar 2022 for the customer?
Seifi Ghasemi: It is in Fiscal 2023. Fiscal '22, I mentioned in the call, that had been below.
Duffy Fischer: Okay, '22 is low, '23 gets a-okay, fair enough. And then the second one on your Alberta project, I believe one of your big customers is up there is Suncor, and they had announced about a month earlier than you guys a similar project. Does your project supersede what they were going to do? Or is there enough space up there that both of you can do a large green hydrogen project?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I obviously don't want to speak for Suncor. They are a customer of ours, but they are not the only supplier. They have their own SMRs. So what they intend to do, our contract with them lasts until 2028. I don't know what is their intention about doing a project to replace their owns. Doing projects to replace their own and what they buy from us, that's something that you have to talk to them about. I don't want to be speaking for them. But project they announced, it'll come on stream in 2028, and our project would come on stream in 2024.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. A fuel-cell Company which is -- was a hydrogen customer noted on their earnings call that they transitioned away from Air Products because they were unhappy with the supply per pricing. The same Company is also building out its own green hydrogen supply chain. Maybe you want to respond to that situation since it was mentioned on an investor call recently. But the question really is more broadly, what do you say to investors that might be concerned about competition for hydrogen distribution in mobility applications?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, with respect to that specific customer who made those comments, I wish them very good luck and to what they are doing. We have stopped supplying them for a very simple reason because beating the product that we have is worth a lot more and we can sell it for a higher price at -- to other people, therefore. We are in the business of making money. There was no sense for us to continue to sell hydrogen at low prices. That's why we have stopped dealing with them. In terms of building their own plant, as I said, I wish them good luck, and I hope they are successful. And as far as other people wanting to get into the business, that's perfectly fine. We have been in the business of making hydrogen for the last 60 years. A lot of people are waking up in the morning and now want to get into the hydrogen business. I wish them good luck. There is plenty of opportunities, plenty of demand for this product, and if they want to get into it, they are more than welcomed. I don't think we are concerned about that. We welcome competition. We have competition in everything else we do. And therefore, I have no concern about that. And I wish everybody good luck who wants to get into the business. We just have a minor 60 years of head start on them, but that people might consider is not that significant, but they'll find out what it takes.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move on to Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning. Hey, Scott, congratulations. Hope you find a fun place to retire, like Cleveland. But just one question on the 2027 goals Seifi. And you've talked about demand being really good for hydrogen and other areas. Is it possible that you could maybe deploy that capital sooner than '27 or is it maybe you have to spend more potentially if demand is going to be that strong?
Seifi Ghasemi: What we believe is that the demand is very strong, and we do believe that we will compete for more than that. So that's our view.
Mike Sison: Right. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Seifi Ghasemi for any additional or closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I just want to thank everybody for being on our call and listening to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we obviously look forward to discussing our results with you again next Quarter. As I said earlier, please stay safe and healthy, and all the best. Thank you very much for being on our call.
Operator: And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-05-10 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note, that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Rochelle. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products second quarter 2021 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide number 2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, the effective tax rates and ROCE both on a companywide and segment basis. We are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. We thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. To start, I want to acknowledge the united and extraordinary efforts of all of the talented, committed and resilient people of Air Products around the world. They work hard every day to provide critical products and services to our customers. Our people working in solidarity, and in a determined way, have made it possible for us to keep our 750 facilities around the board operating throughout this unprecedented crisis. And I want to particularly thank our team, who worked through the very challenging, severe winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our people are the ones who are making it possible for us to continue to deliver our near-term business results, while also, pushing forward to develop, execute, and operate major world-class projects to ensure our growth in the future. Our people are the ones who make our higher purpose real every day. That is, to help humanity, move forward in a sustainable way, and bring people together to help solve energy and environmental challenges.
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. We continue to demonstrate the resilience of our company our business, and most importantly, our people. EPS increased despite the ongoing COVID impact, lower earnings from Lu'An and the extreme U.S. Gulf Coast weather during the quarter. Our business, which is about half onsite continue to deliver stable cash flow in spite of difficult conditions continuing around the world. Now please turn to Slide 12, for a brief discussion of our second quarter results. Sales topped $2.5 billion, up 13% compared to prior year, driven by strong prices, higher energy pass-through and favorable currencies. Volume was flat, as the additions of new plants, acquisitions, and increased sale of equipment activities were offset by reduced Lu'An contributions, COVID-19 impacts and the winter storm. Prices were again up versus prior year, with improvements in all three regions. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year pricing gains. Overall, prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 5% increase for the merchant business. COVID-19 continue to negatively impact our business. We estimate the pandemic reduced overall sales by about 3%, and EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15. The U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm disrupted our customers, interfered with our operations and caused a sharp spike in local energy prices. However, we were able to mitigate much of the negative impact through operational actions and contractual pass-through to customers. Our people worked tirelessly overcoming these challenges during this time, restarting our plants quickly and restoring supply to our customers, as they also recovered from the weather impacts. I want to extend my sincere gratitude to our people for a job well done. The adverse weather in addition to having a modest negative impact on sales and profits, also reduced our margin. Higher energy costs pass-through primarily due to the storm decreased the EBITDA margin by about 300 basis points this quarter. As a reminder, this contractual pass-through increases sales, but not profits. EBITDA of $934 million improved 5%, as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset the negative impact of volume, the winter storm in the U.S. and higher development costs. Operating income was 2% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to depreciation on new plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year. ROCE was 320 basis points lower, primarily due to the increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt. Sequentially, sales were up 5%, primarily driven by 4% higher energy cost pass-through.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide number 16, for our Asia results. Sales increased 6% compared to last year, as favorable currency and price more than offset the weaker volumes. Pricing up in all countries added 1%, which represents a 3% increase for the merchant business. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price improvement. Sequentially, price was also positive, but rounded to zero. Volumes are down 2%, as higher merchant volumes, I'd like to repeat, higher merchant volumes and new plans partially offset the impact of Lu'An being shut down. Merchant volume improvement in the region has been encouraging, particularly in light of the strong rebound, following the expected Lunar New Year slowdown. But, the recovery is not consistent across all product lines. Additionally, we brought on a stream a number of new smaller plants that contributed to our results. EBITDA was similar to last year, as strong price and favorable currency have offset the impact of lower volumes. EBITDA margin of 46.4% was 330 basis points lower than last year, due primarily due to lower volume driven by Lu'An. Sales and profit were down sequentially, primarily due to a Lunar New Year. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Scott to talk about our Americas results. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 17, for review of our Americas results. Sales increased 13% compared to last year, as strong price and significantly higher energy pass-through more than offset lower volumes. Volume was down 6%, primarily due to the continuing negative impact of COVID-19, and the winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although, there are signs of overall economic improvements in the U.S., the operating results for U.S. refineries remain below. The winter storm this quarter further reduced the demand for hydrogen in the Gulf Coast, in addition to pressuring the merchant products. We have also seen some transitory contractual reduction in our hydrogen business recently, as some refineries are reconfiguring their operations to produce renewable fuels. However, such production will use hydrogen once the process is completed. The uses of hydrogen for renewable fuel per unit is in fact four to five times more than conventional fuel. Price was again better across most major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent to a 7% increase on the merchant business. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of the year-on-your price improvement. Higher energy pass-through increased sales by 15%. The higher energy prices through the rest of the quarter were exacerbated by the record high prices during the winter storm much of this contraction the pass-through the customers. EBITDA reached nearly $450 million, a 6% increase over last year, as better price, higher equity affiliate income and the PBF acquisition, more than offset the volume shortfall, including the adverse impact of the winter storm. EBITDA margin declined 310 basis points. Higher energy pass-through, which increased sales but not profits, reduced margin by 650 basis points. In other words, margins were up over 300 basis points, excluding the energy cost pass-through impact. Compared to last quarter, Americas volumes increased 2%, following the holiday season, and continued the gradual COVID recovery. Price also improved 1%. EBITDA improved double digit sequentially, supported by improved volume, lower maintenance and higher equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin was almost flat sequentially, which included a negative 450 basis point impact from higher energy pass-through. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other statements. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Now, please turn to Slide 18, for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region results. Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales and EBITDA both improved nearly 20% versus last year. Volume plus price was up 7%. As volume grew 5%, principally due to acquisitions and higher onsite volumes, which more than overcame the adverse impact of COVID-19 predominantly in our packaged gas business. Price increase for the 13th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines and sub regions. The 2% price gain for the region corresponds to a 3% improvement for the merchant business. Currencies were favorable at 9%, primarily due to the strong euro and British pound. EBITDA jumped 17% and nearly $220 million, supported by favorable price, volume, currencies and equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin dipped 50 basis points, primarily due to a negative 100 basis point impact from higher energy costs pass-through. EBITDA was down 2% compared to last quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower equity affiliate income, while margin decreased 220 basis points including a 70 basis point negative impact from higher energy costs pass-through. Now, please turn to Slide 19, global gases, which includes our non-LNG sales equipment businesses, as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending. Please turn to Slide 20, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses, as well as our corporate costs. Sales were higher this quarter driven by increased project activities, as we continue to execute multiple large LNG and other projects. Profit dipped slightly on higher corporate costs. Now, to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. Now please go to Slide number 21. Unfortunately, as everybody knows, the world continues to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic. With widespread vaccination efforts, some regions have been able to reduce the spread of the virus, while others are experiencing an increase in number of cases. Against this backdrop, we take pride in our ability to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow. Our onsite business, roughly half of our total sales remain stable, and our price continued to be strong. We have also seen signs of improvement in merchant volumes. As we look forward, although we still see uncertainties ahead, our confidence in major economies around the world is growing, particularly in light of the increasing pace of vaccination. Therefore, we have resumed providing EPS guidance this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Lu'An has asked us to restart our facilities. And we expect Jazan to close during this fiscal year. However, there remains some uncertainty to the exact timing of these events, therefore, they are providing or EPS and CapEx guidance, excluding Jazan and Lu'An restart. In other words, the restart of Lu'An and the financial close of Jazan, if they happen within this fiscal year, they will be accreted to the guidance that I'm giving. For Quarter 3 of fiscal year 2021, our earnings per share guidance is $2.30 to $2.40 per share, which is up 14% to 19% over the last year. And the guidance for our fiscal year 2021 is $8.95 to $9.10, up 7% to 9% over last year. We see our CapEx at approximately $2.5 billion for this year, again, excluding Jazan. Meanwhile, we continue to execute our other projects, bringing them on stream and finalizing agreements with our customers. We are committed to the capital deployment strategy and to growing our pipeline of our projects. Please turn to Slide number 22. As always, the success of our strategy is rooted in the great team we have at Air Products. We believe strongly that our only sustainable long-term competitive advantage is the degree of commitment and motivation of our people, the people who work hard every day to bring our strategy to life. I am very proud to be working with this team. Our deep commitment to sustainability creates exciting growth opportunities, driven by the energy transition to a lower carbon board. Our gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen growth platforms are at the core of this transition. In the past five years, our differentiated strategy and our core competencies have positioned Air Products to lead across these areas. Now, at this time, we are very pleased to answer any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you.  And our first question today will be from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. Seifi, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on capital allocation. If you were to look out over the medium to longer-term, let's say five years, how would you expect to allocate capital among three buckets? The first would be green hydrogen, the second gasification, and the third, traditional projects, such as ASUs and SMRs.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, good morning, Kevin. Thank you for your question. I see that, we are focused on gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, and obviously, our underlying standard business. We think that our underlying business will require an investment of approximately $500 million to $700 million, $800 million with all of these smaller plants and generators, and all of that, to grow with the overall economy in the world. Then in terms of the other three opportunities, in terms of capital allocation, I don't want to kind of prefer one over the other, because it depends different parts of the world. Obviously, we're not going to spend any money on significant gasification project, in some of the more developed our gasification, for example, Europe or the U.S., but there will be coal gasification projects in India and Indonesia and the other and China. Carbon capture is going to require a lot of capital and that will be very, very prevalent in, I foresee in Europe, and in the United States, specifically. And then, obviously, green hydrogen and blue hydrogen, it will be all over the board. So, I would have a balance of them. But since these are all mega projects, for a year or two, one of them might be higher than the other one. But in the course of five to 10-years, if you take all of the capital allocation, I think that most of the capital will go to carbon capture, then hydrogen, and then gasification.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you for that. Yes. Thank you. And secondly, if I may Seifi, you mentioned that some of your hydrogen customers are reconfiguring to produce renewable fuels. How much of that do you expect to occur? And, what is the net benefit? It sounds like the reconfigured refineries would consume a lot more hydrogen, so just trying to get a sense of what that benefit could be to you over time?
Seifi Ghasemi: The benefit could actually be very positive. The only caveat over here is that there is a lot of talk about this thing, there is a lot of interest in it. But, I'm a conservative person, I want to wait and see how many of these projects actually do materialize. But as I think, as Scott mentioned, and he was talking about the Americas, the intensity of hydrogen requirement per barrel of renewable diesel versus a barrel of ordinary diesel is almost four to five times. So, if these refineries in a major way convert to renewable diesel the demand for hydrogen will actually go up. But again, I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves, because there is a lot of talk, but we'll see how many of these projects will actually materialize.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Kevin.
Operator: Next we move to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, David. How are you?
David Begleiter: I'm well, thank you. Seifi, just on Jazan, once the financing is complete, should the project start up immediately? And also, has your expected return on the project comes down during this period of discussion and negotiation?
Seifi Ghasemi: You're talking about Jazan?
David Begleiter: Yeah.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. First of all, if I may answer the second part of your question, we had given some general guidance about the profitability of this project to the investors almost two years ago. During the period of the negotiations and so on, that expectation is still correct. Secondly, the first part of your question, once we close on this thing, the day we close, the next day we will get our fixed fee, and therefore it will be accretive to our EPS.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on the Lu'An, do you expect the same level of earnings post this current restart, as you had prior to the project going down back, I think last June?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I think we explained to you that we renegotiated the contract, we renegotiated that. We have a structure for if the plan is down, but we get paid. We have a structure for when the plant is up and running for a period of time and then we get back to full payment for the original contract. So there's kind of three levels.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, David.
Operator: We'll move on to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning. How are you?
Vincent Andrews: I'm very well, thank you. I hope the same with you. You mentioned that the purchase of the other 50% of the Chinese JV that you didn't own, you made it sound like that was going to be sort of a trigger that would lead to the announcement of other gasification projects. I'm just curious if you could elaborate on sort of what is the significance of owning that other 50%, therefore, maybe it allows you to do some other projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: Because then you don't have to consult with somebody else in terms of what we do and what we don't do. Because when you are 50-50 joint venture, you have to have a consensus, when you are going to do different projects in different parts of the world, and different people have different preferences. But, then it is 100% own, then we can decide on our own what we want to do, therefore, I think that is why I said if they facilitate us in terms of getting additional projects.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And if I could also ask you on the guidance for the back-half of the year, maybe specific to the Americas. Are you assuming any meaningful improvements for your refinery customers and/or for helium volumes?
Seifi Ghasemi: Not particularly. No, for neither one. We are assuming that things will be approximately -- there might be some improvement, but that is not the driver for the forecast. We are taking a conservative approach here.
Vincent Andrews: Very good. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move on to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Hi, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas: I was hoping you could clarify some of the dynamics in the Americas business. There was some kind of penalty from the storm. And there was some order of magnitude benefit from the acquisitions that you've made. If you look at the volume exclusive of the storm and the acquisitions, what might it have been during the quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: The volumes would have been down.
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes, I know that.
Seifi Ghasemi: You are referring to our hydrogen business, Jeff, right?
Jeff Zekauskas: No, I'm referring to the consolidated volumes in the Americas, that is what would they have been exclusive of acquisitions and exclusive of the storm?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think our merchant business. I mean, our Lux Linen  business would have been kind of flat, and then our hydrogen business would have been lower. Because, as you know, we have some refineries like the shell refineries, which was a customer shut down. And then, out of the 100% volume, some of the volume on the pipeline is not contracted long-term. It is a spot sale. And the refineries considering their level of operation being low, they had cut back on their spot sales. So the hydrogen volumes would have been lower, especially on the Gulf Coast.
Jeff Zekauskas: The equity income in that division was $32 million in the quarter. And maybe it was up $10 million year-over-year and $10 million sequentially. Why was the equity income so high? And is that an unusual number?
Seifi Ghasemi: The equity income is so high just because I explained that last time, because our equity affiliate in America is Mexico. And Mexico, unfortunately, because of COVID the demand for oxygen was phenomenal. Just the way it is right now in India and the way it is in Brazil, quite frankly, that is why some of our competitors are having very good results because of that. It's a very unfortunate situation. But, I mentioned last quarter that if you are in the medical business right now, Mexico, Brazil, India will make you a lot of money. And we saw that benefit in our joint venture in Mexico.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, good. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move on to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, good morning. It's Mike here actually, sitting in for a Bob.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, Mike.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey. Good morning. Your favorite Slide number 11, I noticed that the EBITDA margin appeared to have declined like three consecutive quarters, and you seem to be gaining price. So just kind of trying to reconcile how you gain in price losing margin. So how should I think about the margin going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think you should -- you're on the very right track, and let's look at the causes. Number one, the margin comes down when Lu'An is shut down, because Lu'An is a very, very high margin business. So, that Lu'An by itself has a significant effect than it is now. The second thing is that when natural gas prices go up, we end up showing more sales because we are buying natural gas and then the customer reimburses us for that. But, it shows us higher sales, but it doesn't affect the profit line. So if natural gas, every dollar of natural gas going up, affects our sales by $350 million immediately. So, if natural gas prices continue to go up, then our margins -- for our hydrogen business looks lower, because the profit doesn't change, but the sales go up. So, those are the two effects that you need to think about. So as we go forward, if natural gas prices come back to the levels they were, and if Lu'An starts up, then you're going to see our margins go up. So, I still feel very good about our margins. We haven't seen a fundamental change in the profitability of our business.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks for the color. And just as a follow up, looking at Lu'An, when we think about commissioning, is that a process that you think about in terms of weeks or months? And once that facility is back online, is there some type of break in period that they have to run at reduced rates? Or can they ramp that facility up fairly quick?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that, with the plant that has been shut down and you start it up, you never know which pump works, which pump doesn't work. But, as I mentioned in my comments, as of this morning, we do have one of the gasifiers online for supplying their product to our customers. And I'm hoping that the other three will come on stream in the next few months. We don't want to be too specific, because we can stock up and one pump can have a failure, and then you have to recommission or change the pump and all that. But overall, it's not going to take years, it's going to be a relatively short period of time.
Bob Koort: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. How are you doing these days?
John McNulty: Good, good. Yeah. And hopefully you are as well. So I guess, a little bit of a follow-up on Lu'An. This year has obviously been a lumpy year with it, with a kind of not getting paid full out, like the contract being rejiggered a little bit, while it was down. I guess, is there a way to think about, how -- if the total payout in fiscal '21 versus fiscal '22 will look out in terms of overall earnings contribution?
Seifi Ghasemi: Fiscal '21, which is the one we are in right now, next is fiscal '22 right? But this year, I mean, we haven't made a lot of money in Lu'An, because the plant has been shut down for six months, and now we are starting it up. So, I think that fiscal year '22 will be significantly better than '21 barring any plant breakdown or anything.
John McNulty: Okay. So it should be back to kind of the $0.25 contribution or something in that range. Is that the right way to think about it?
Seifi Ghasemi: I don't want to confirm that, because it depends on how much we run and all of that. But John, the biggest issue over here was the fact that people thought that gasification is dead, the plant will be shut down forever. But, we always said that's not the case, we always said that this is due to change in management and so on. And that has proven to be correct. So, the fact is that the customer wants the plants running, the plant is valuable, it is going to produce products. And now how much is our profitability in '22, I'm sure it's better than '21, but it also depends on how we run the plant and how many times we can keep the gasifiers on the stream and all of that. So, I don't want to give you a definite prediction. Obviously, we will give you a much more accurate prediction in October, when we give you our guidance for 2022.
John McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, you spoke to merchants business starting to pick up and seeing signs of the macro kind of having some pull there. Can you speak to what that means for bidding activity around, either the gasification side or some of the traditional on site business? Are you starting to see increases in bidding activity or demand and interest from kind of the larger scale customers at this point? And how should we think about that, in terms of filling up the backlog and contract announcement, as we look through the rest of this year?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, the demand for those kind of projects never slowed down during the COVID. It continued to be very strong, it continues to be very strong. And we are very optimistic about the deployments and targets. As Scott mentioned, that we have almost 95% delivered two years in advance. And we are very bullish on that. We see a lot of very large projects that we are working on, and I think those will bear fruit as we go forward.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
Operator: We'll move on to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Mike. How are you?
Mike Harrison: Doing well. Thanks, Seifi. I wanted to ask you about the Asia business, it sounds like you saw a strong recovery following the typical Lunar New Year shutdowns. But, I believe you said that markets are recovering at different rates, or maybe that the recovery has been a little bit uneven. So, can you give us a little bit more color on what you saw in Asia coming out of Lunar New Year?
Seifi Ghasemi: That's a very good question, actually, In that, what I said was that we saw a very strong recovery in China and other places after the Lunar New Year. The thing that I said is that the recovery is not even across all product lines, that specifically means that our Lux Linen business is coming on strong, our Oregon business is coming in strong. But that is not necessarily true about our helium business in that part of the board, and that is because some of our -- because we have that -- as you know, we are holding very firm to our pricing strategy. And as a result, we might be losing some market share there.
Mike Harrison: Alright. And then, within the electronics market, it seems like that is set up to see very strong demand over the next couple of years. But as I look at the onsite facilities that you're going to be starting up in the coming years, really just looks like the Samsung plants in Korea. Can you talk about your activity within the electronics market, and whether there are some additional onsite opportunities that maybe aren't listed there on that slide, or that you plan to book over the coming months or years?
Seifi Ghasemi: The demand for electronics and electronics onsite business for high purity nitrogen is very strong. We are participating in that. We have won a lot of contracts, some of that we cannot announce because the customer doesn't want to announce it. Because they want to keep that plants kind of confidential. But, we are not losing any market share in that area. We have the proprietary products, which are actually very competitive. And we remain very bullish in that area.
Mike Harrison: All right. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hey guys, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, good morning. How are you?
Mike Sison: Good. Looking at your capital deployment scorecard going back a couple of years, and that remaining to be spent is just goes up every year, which is good. It shows that you're growing the business obviously, but what do you think we start to see that come down, meaning that you have more meaningful projects coming in? And do you envision that it actually gets to zero at some point?
Seifi Ghasemi: You're talking about our capital expenditure?
Mike Sison: Yeah, the remaining to be spent line item.
Seifi Ghasem: Oh, that is going to grow my friend. It's not going to come down. We are going to continue to invest heavily for the next 10, 15-years because the opportunities are huge. Our financial capacity is there. And we are not going to be buying shares. We will maintain our dividends and increase it. But we are not going to waste our money buying shares. We are going to invest in high return projects, which there are plenty of them for us. And what we will do is that in a few months, we are going to give you a plan for the next five years, the same way that we did in 2018. In 2018, we said between '18 and '23, we will spend about $15 billion, we're way ahead of that. And in a few months, we will give you a plan for 2020 -- a 10-year plan, 2018 to 2028.
Mike Sison: Got it. And then quick follow… 
Seifi Ghasemi: So, don’t expect -- yeah, go ahead.
Mike Sison: I understand. For 2022, I know it's early to give specific guidance. But do you think investors should be adding Jazan and Lu'An back to their 2022 outlook, particularly, as we look at the value of the company going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, if everything goes fine, and we are totally successful in bringing Lu'An online and we signed all of the final contracts and finish the financing 2022 will be a good year, because then Jazan and Lu'An will be there compared to this year.
Mike Sison: Got it. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasem: That’s not a bad assumption. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move on to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, fellas.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Duffy Fischer: Just a question, last weekend, Wall Street Journal had an article talking about delays at the greater NEOM project. And I get that your project can't be separate from the city itself. But just want to see if you guys are seeing any of those types of delays as you're moving forward, kind of where are you with purchasing long lead time equipment? And when will we start to see that capital from the neon actually rolling through your cash flow and your balance sheet?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, I don't want to make any comment about the BR ] NEOM project, because I don't know enough about it, and that's not something that we are involved in. The one thing that I can confirm is that our project has nothing to do with the city, whether the city is delayed or built or not built, it doesn't affect our project at all. We are self-contained, we are going to prepare, desalinating our own water. We are going to produce our own power. And so, we are totally self-contained. So, any kind of any issues with the city will not affect our project. In terms of our project, we have placed orders for some of the long tail items, and we are making progress. And in terms of cash flow, it is -- already, we're spending money on that project right now.
Duffy Fischer: Great, thanks. And maybe if we could jump to helium. I know there's notionally some new capacity coming online, but it seems like demand for helium is picking up strongly. Can you walk us through how you would view kind of the next one, two, three years just supply demand in the helium market globally?
Seifi Ghasemi: So on that one, I think the number of sources of helium and all of that. The biggest question about supply demand in helium is not a secret. It is what is going to happen to the project that Russia is doing, so called Amur project. That project will produce a lot of helium when it is online. The issue is, when is it going to be online? Is it going to be end of 2021, 2022, 2023? At what rate that is in Siberia and all that. So I don't want to make any predictions on that. But that is the only other major project that is underway.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Next we'll hear from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Thank you. You mentioned some temporary hydrogen headwinds as those refiners reconfigured to biodiesel. Do the hydrogen contracts allow for suspension of volume, if they have extended downtime to reconfigure?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, John. No, it does not allow for that. Our contracts or takeoff pay, so while people contemplate different things that doesn't affect our contracts, John.
John Roberts: Okay. And then, can you give us a very short quick update on the other three gasification projects, Jiutai, Debang and Indonesia?
Seifi Ghasemi: They are on a schedule, on plan.
John Roberts: Okay. That's good. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll move on to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Seifi, I found your response to Kevin's capital allocation question interesting, where you highlighted carbon capture as being potentially the largest bucket. And I wanted to just drill into that a little bit, would you say that is potentially the largest because of the interest in it as from customers that see it as a way to meet some carbon reduction targets, in a relatively inexpensive way? Or would you say that, you have something to bring that's really somewhat differentiated in the capacity of either your technology or your access to these CO2 rich streams coming out of the SMR, is that you could target? And, just anything that you might have to add on that with perspective of any limitations to where you can sequester the CO2?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for the question. And also, thank you for providing the answers, because you kind of answered the question by saying that we are in a unique position, we are operating the largest carbon capture facility in the world right now, operational. We have been running it for several years. We captured a million ton a year of CO2 from the semis that we have in Port Arthur. So, we know how to do this thing. Secondly, is that we have many, many SMR that put out CO2, therefore, the CO2 is there that can be captured. The other thing is the fact that there is significant focus on this because by capturing CO2, you can make blue hydrogen, and therefore the transition to the hydrogen economy can happen very quickly using either carbons. And a lot of people are very interested in that. People who make hydrocarbons are very interested in finding a way to produce hydrogen, capture the carbon and say, here's a hydrogen which is almost is not as good as green hydrogen, but it is hydrogen with significantly reduced carbon footprint. So, that is why I am -- I think that there will be a lot of big investments in that area. And we are very well-positioned with our core competency, with the plants that we have around the world to be a major player on that. And we intend to be a major player on that. Our goal is very simple, gasification, we have put ourselves in a position that we are the major, the leading company for gasification. Any gasification project in the world, probably Air Products will do that. We plan to be the leader in blue hydrogen, which means CO2 capture, and we plan to be the leader in green hydrogen, which we already are with the plant that we're building in NEOM.
Steve Byrne: And Seifi, just one on your outlook for the fuel cell buses. We talked about this tour of U.S. cities, and I just wanted to get your view on whether that opportunity is potentially more attractive in the U.S., because these cities can start with grey hydrogen that's relatively less expensive than if it were sourced from natural gas in Europe at three times the price? Is it the attraction starting gray? Or do you see longer-term the fuel cell buses in regions like Europe is potentially larger, in that green hydrogen could be more comparably cost and priced relative to gray? A - Seifi Ghasemi Look, you're raising an excellent question. The issue is that in terms of the economics, you would expect that the U.S. will be ahead of Europe, because of the cheap natural gas that we can convert and all of that, that you can capture the carbon and have blue hydrogen and all of that. But then, there is the fundamental element of the government interest. And what we are finding out is that the governments in Europe are a lot more committed to green hydrogen. They are really committed to green hydrogen, not blue. They want green. And as a result, I think our hydrogen business, our green hydrogen business, the biggest potential will be in Europe, rather than in the U.S., or any other part of the world. That's the way it is developing right now. But things can change. Government policies can change. I mean, if in the United States, all of their states, or at least the majority of the states adopt the LCFS plan that California has put in place, then you are going to see a boom in terms of hydrogen in the U.S. But I don't know whether that happens or if that happens. But in Europe, we see that. And then in Japan, they are going with the idea of taking blue ammonium and putting it in their power plants to reduce their carbon footprint. So the different parts of the world are doing different things. But what you are delineating is a very logical economic thing. But on top of that, you have to put the layer of the where the government pressure is. And I think for a project like NEOM, the biggest potential market will probably be Europe.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. First question relates to the guidance, just wanted to confirm how you're handling the COVID impact the $0.10 to $0.15 that you cited for the past two quarters for the remainder of the year?
Seifi Ghasemi: So, we are expecting that the COVID impact would be a little bit less in the U.S. because of the vaccination, and an improvement in Europe because of the vaccination. And then in China and the rest of Asia, that COVID impact is not as significant anyway. So we have kind of considered some improvement because of COVID impact, but still having in mind that there will be some.
Marc Bianchi: Great. Thanks for that. And then I wanted to follow up on the carbon capture. It would appear that -- you responded to the earlier question discussing blue hydrogen, but it would appear there's quite an opportunity for stacking some of these carbon capture credits for renewable diesel. And obviously, there's a higher hydrogen content there I think you mentioned. Why aren't we seeing that occur right now? You mentioned there's a lot of talk about projects, but maybe things aren't happening. I'm curious what bottlenecks might exist. And if that involves perhaps some takeaway capacity for CO2 that maybe needs to be built by someone else, before those can move forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, let me just focus on making sure I understood your question correctly. You're saying how come these renewable diesel projects are not happening faster? I think the main reason is that right now, the only place where it makes sense to sell renewable diesel and still be profitable is in California. So people I mean, Valero when they are producing this thing in Texas, they don't sell it in Texas, they sell it in California, because if they sell it in Texas, they would lose money. Because just the cost of the raw material for making renewable diesel is probably $2.5, $3 a gallon. So, right now everybody is making teams to go to California and sell it in California. And therefore, people are sitting down and saying how many-- how much capacity does California have? Because if you add all of these renewable diesels, in four or five years 100% of the diesel sold in California will be renewable. Then what do you do? So people need to get themselves comfortable that this policy that California has will be picked up by Oregon and Colorado and New York and all that, which I think it will be. But until it is done, I think you're not going to see a significant growth on this thing, because people are going to say, well, how am I going to -- where am I going to sell it.
Marc Bianchi: And just following on to the other part of the question, related to carbon capture opportunity. Is there a bit of a chicken and egg problem there, where the infrastructure might not be in place to take the captured carbon to wherever it's going to be stored or sequestered? And how do you see the market sorting that out?
Seifi Ghasemi: But, you're very right, because then people talk about capturing carbon. So we can capture carbon for you anywhere there is a plan, which puts out CO2 out of an SMR or a chemical unit, we know how to capture that. That's the easy part. The question is that, what do you do, once you have captured it. You need to have a place to sequester it. And the biggest question is that where is it possible to sequester it, where is it possible that there is enough poorer space to do that. That is the major question that will come into play in terms of how many of these projects can you do, where can they be done and all of that.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you very much, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you.
Operator: We'll move on to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.
Stephen Richardson: Hi, good morning. Just want to come back quickly on Lu'An if you might. I just want to confirm what we're hearing this morning, which is that when you're fully through commissioning, and when you're running the before gas fires, and appreciate this products run at a very, very high utilization rate historically. But, Seifi, is what you're saying that whenever you hit that run rate, will the contribution be substantially similar from Lu'An is what it's been historically? Meaning, there hasn't been any change to the commercial terms or the economics from Air Products perspective?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that is the question that I tried to answer before that when we renegotiated or reconsidered the arrangements with Lu'An -- I don't want to go through all of the details, because the customer doesn't want us to disclose that. We said that we have come up with three stages. One is when the plant is shut down, what did we get? The second thing is that, when the plant is up on a stream, what do we get for a certain period of time, and then we go back to the original contracts. So, I do not want to represent to you that if we come on a stream 100% in 2022, we will make as much money the $0.25, as we did in 2019, it will be less than that. How much less than that, I cannot disclose it. But there is a period of time, where we have agreed to reduce our fee to help the customer. But then, the overall return on the project is still as good if not better, because the customer has agreed to extend the term of the contract, which means that our return on capital for the length of the contract is still intact.
Stephen Richardson: Okay, thank you. Yes, that's clear. Thank you. And one follow up Seifi if I may. I mean, you've been through, obviously, a lot of conversations over the last two to three quarters, both on Jazan and Lu'An. And it's clearly taken a lot of the markets focus. I was wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit about, lessons learned about how you'll talk about projects going forward, the way in which you think about products in the backlog, and kind of the best way to communicate these variabilities, which will come up from time to time with the market and your investors going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the one lesson that I have learned all my life, it's not just -- is that you always need to tell people the truth at the time that you are talking to them. And therefore, maybe we overdid it, maybe it could have been handled differently. But, I believe we handled the right way. In November of 2020, I was very concerned about Lu'An, and I was very concerned about Jazan. And I told the investors. Now, I did explain to them put the caveat in them that some people didn't listen to us that look, I don't think these are -- this is what I know right now. But this doesn't mean it's the end of the world. This doesn't mean that it's the end of gasification. This doesn't mean that we are not going to do Jazan. But some people took it like that, and our stock got hit by $50. But quite honestly, if I had to do it again, I would always tell the investors what we know at the time that we're talking to you. And we should be transparent. But I think maybe we can do a better job. We can always do a better job, maybe we can do a better job of putting it in the right context, not to kind of create patterns. But, one other thing that I'm sure the investors appreciate is that, as we go forward with all of these big projects, and so on, these kinds of things is normal that it happens. It's just my request to the customers and to the investors is please just don't panic. I mean, we will tell you what it is. And, make a judgment based on the facts rather than suddenly other people who have always been saying that gasification doesn't work. And then we said, Lu'An is shut down, and they said, look, I told you so, this is it, this is the end of it. Nothing else is going to happen. These guys are going to the wrong track. But again, as I said, we will always tell you exactly what we know at the time we talk to you.
Stephen Richardson: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir. We are significantly over time. Can we say this is the last question, please?
Operator: Yes, fair enough.
Seifi Ghasemi: Do we have another question?
Operator: No. At this time, I will…
Seifi Ghasemi: No other call, then that's the right time to end this. Well, I'd just like to again, thank everybody for being on our call, and listening to our presentation. We sincerely appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again, next quarter. And as I said earlier, please stay safe and healthy. And all the best. Take care. Thank you.
Operator: And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-02-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note, that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved.
Simon Moore: Thank you, LeAnn. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products first quarter 2021 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations, Corporate Relations and Sustainability. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and ROCE both on a companywide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. We thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We are living at a time when all humanity faces significant challenges. The most important and immediate one is the battle against the deadly virus that has already taken many lives and continues to ravage communities around the globe. We can only fight this deadly and global virus if we work together and stay united. In my more than 45 years in business, I have learned that all problems, no matter how challenging, can be solved if we stay focused and united working to our common goal. So, it is in this spirit of working together as a team that I want to acknowledge the united and extraordinary efforts of all the talented, committed and resilient people of Air Products around the world. They work hard every day to provide critical products and services to our customers. Our people working in solidarity and in a determined way have made it possible for us to keep our 750 facilities around the world operating during this unprecedented crisis.
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi stated earlier, our company continued to demonstrate resilience, delivering both higher sales and EBITDA this quarter despite the challenges of the pandemic. Our business, which is about half on-site, continued to deliver stable cash flow in-spite of the difficult conditions continuing around the world. Now, please turn to slide 13 for a brief discussion of our first quarter results. Sales of $2.4 billion were up 5% compared to prior year driven by strong price, higher energy pass-through and a positive currency impact. Price actions continue to be an area of focus for us and improved in all three regions. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gain. Volume was relatively stable, down 1% as the additions of new plants, acquisitions and increased sale of equipment activities were more than offset by COVID-19 impacts and the reduced Lu'An contribution that Seifi mentioned. EBITDA of $932 million was up 3%, as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset the impact of lower volume and higher costs, primarily due to higher planned maintenance outages. EBITDA margin declined about 100 basis points as lower volumes, including Lu'An and higher costs driven by increased planned maintenance in North America more than offset the positive price impact. Operating income was 4% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to depreciation on new plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to slide number 17 for our Asia results. Compared to last year, currency, price and energy pass-through resulted in a 4% increase in sales despite weaker volumes. Currency favorable across most key countries contributed 6%. Overall price rose 1% for the region, which represents a 3% increase for merchant products. I'd like to remind you that pricing was positive for Asia for the 15th consecutive quarter and particularly strong in Korea and Taiwan this quarter. Volumes were down 4% with new plants more than offset by Lu'An, while the merchant business remained stable. Despite the impact of lower volumes, the strong price and favorable currencies kept EBITDA -- we kept EBITDA relatively stable. EBITDA margin at almost 48% was 240 basis points lower, primarily driven by lower volumes mostly from Lu'An. Sequentially, sales were up 1% with favorable currencies more than offsetting the weaker volumes. EBITDA increased 4% primarily driven by lower costs, while favorable currency offset the negative impact of weaker volumes. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk about our Americas results.
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to slide 18 for a review of our Americas results. Sales were flat compared to last year. Higher price and energy pass-through were offset by lower volumes. Price was again better across all major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent to 7% for merchant. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Volume was down primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, but partially offset by the PBF acquisition. EBITDA of $400 million was 2% below last year's level, as better price and the PBF acquisition were offset by the volume shortfall and higher maintenance costs. For the quarter, although Americas planned maintenance was higher than last year, it is consistent with what we expect in Q2. EBITDA margin dipped 90 basis points with a negative 80 basis point impact from higher energy pass-through, while the unfavorable cost impact was largely offset by other favorable factors, including price and acquisitions. Now, I'll make some comments on our sequential results. Sales increased 2% as higher energy pass-through and positive price overcame negative volume. Price was up across all major product lines, while volume was weaker, primarily due to seasonality. EBITDA declined 3% as weaker volume was partially offset by better price. Margin was down primarily on higher energy pass-through, which had about a 200 basis point impact. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Now, please turn to slide 19 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region results. Our EMEA team delivered outstanding results this quarter. Both sales and profits grew double-digit compared to both last year and last quarter. Price, volume and currency were all favorable and contributed to the 13% year-on-year sales growth. Volumes grew 5%, principally due to acquisitions and higher on-site volumes, which offset the adverse impact of COVID-19 predominantly in our packaged gas business. Price increased 3% for the region and 4% for merchant, with improvement across most major product lines and sub-regions. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Currencies were favorable 6%, primarily due to the euro strength versus the US dollar. EBITDA surged 18% to more than $220 million, supported by price increases, favorable currency and acquisitions. EBITDA margin improved 170 basis points. Sequentially, volume improvement was driven by a modest COVID-19-related recovery in our merchant business, acquisitions and higher on-site volumes. EBITDA was also up sequentially and margins remained about flat. Now, please turn to slide 20, global gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment business as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment projects activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending. As mentioned earlier, we also benefited from the settlement of a supply contract, which offset the gains in project activities last year. Please turn to slide 21, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter versus prior year, driven by LNG project activities as we continued to execute multiple large projects, including Golden Pass and Mozambique, and the massive Qatargas project also began to contribute this quarter. Sales and profits were both down versus prior quarter, primarily due to timing of percent complete activity on the LNG projects. We were excited to announce another new project earlier this week for the Energia Costa Azul LNG export terminal in Ensenada, Mexico. This represents the fourth LNG project we've announced in the last year. Now, to provide some additional thoughts, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. Now, please go to slide number 22. As we look forward, unfortunately, we do not expect the COVID-19 global crisis to moderate anytime soon. This will continue to have a negative impact on the economies of most of the countries we operate. We have confidence that the vaccine will help to reverse the course, but the rollout is still in earlier stages and the pace of vaccination is hard to predict. As a result, we continue to find it very difficult to make any reasonable projections about the course of economic activity around the world. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance or CapEx guidance for quarter two or for our fiscal year 2021 at this time. We hope the outlook will be less uncertain in April. And if so, we look forward to providing you guidance then. However, I want to share with you what we are seeing so far this quarter, that is in the month of January and as of today in February. Representing about half of our sales, our on-site business has been stable and we expect this to continue. With respect to our merchant business, in Asia, our merchant volumes are down slightly versus where they were at the same time last year, which is before the virus crisis began. So, the volumes have reached almost pre-crisis levels. In Europe, we are off to a weaker start, following the holiday season, and continue to see a larger impact on our packaged gases business versus the liquid bulk business. In Americas, merchant volumes remained down, and I would like to remind you again that we do not have a packaged gas business in North America. As we move forward, we remain committed to executing our growth strategy, providing sustainable solutions to help the world meet its increasing needs for cleaner energy. With our strong portfolio, we are able to meet customers' and countries' drive for cleaner and more sustainable solutions. We see great opportunities ahead in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility and we continue to develop and invest in strategic opportunity to drive our growth for decades to come. As always, we continued success -- after the continued -- I'm sorry. As always, the continued success of this strategy is rooted in the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. Our resilient and focused people understand the critical role they play in safely operating more than 750 facilities around the world, executing world scale projects that support economic and social development. As Air Products, we will work together to deliver these solutions to our customers and to the world. I am proud to say that unlike many other companies, we have not reduced staff or reduced the salary of our people during this pandemic. Indeed, we have continued to strengthen our organization by adding the resources necessary to pursue great opportunities. We have stood by our people. In closing today, I would like to thank all of our dedicated and hardworking people around the world who continue to deliver despite these challenging times. I am proud to be working with them every single day. Now, we are pleased to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you.  And we'll take our first question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, guys. Two questions on two of your big projects. First one on Lu'An. With the renegotiation of the contract, do the economics change at all once the plant goes back up and running? And then the second one is just around NEOM. And on that one, when should we see the ground breaking kind of by segment, so when should we see the solar and the wind farm start, when will we see the ammonia plant start and then when will we see the electrolyzer start? If you think about that, kind of what's the timing of those relative to each other? And then maybe just the last one tied on there, have you already ordered long lead time equipment for the NEOM project?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Duffy. Thank you for your question. With respect to Lu'An, we -- as I said, we have negotiated a reduction of fixed fee during the time the plant is shut down, but Lu'An has agreed to extend the contract. So, once the plant comes back on stream, our overall return will be a little bit better than before. The second thing is that with respect to NEOM, we are finalizing the agreements and all of that, you know how it is, and doing pre-engineering and all of that. We hope to break ground sometime in May, June timeframe. And we have ordered some of the long-term items, we are in the process of doing that in a very -- in the next few days.
Duffy Fischer: Great.
Seifi Ghasemi: And we expect, obviously, then everything to come on stream as we go forward for startup in 2025.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. Thanks, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, Duffy?
Duffy Fischer: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Seifi, as you consider future projects in China based on your experience with Lu'An, do you anticipate increasing a sovereign premium or your hurdle rate as you evaluate future projects? And then I had a second question on volume. What was the impact from Lu'An in the quarter? And I think you also mentioned an impact from lower sale of equipment affecting volume in the quarter, if you could quantify that as well, it would be helpful. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Kevin. First of all, I mean, you -- the way you are asking the question about Lu'An as it is something that -- I mean, Lu'An is a specific case. We have gone through that with you in terms of what is happening. We do have four other gasification projects in China, they are operating, there is no issue, we have been paid for the past few years and we continue to being -- continue that. And with Lu'An, the fact that we agreed to a decrease while the plant is shut down is a sign that we are trying to work with the customer because there is a lot -- plenty of new opportunities. So, there is no change in our view about investing in China. We have had an excellent experience. We are having EBITDA margins of 48%. We see significant opportunities. That is the economy of the future, and to ignore it would be really short-sighted. And, therefore, we are -- we continue to be committed to that country the way we have been before. With respect to exactly quantifying those two numbers that you want to do, I'm hesitant to do that because then we will tell you exactly what are the terms and conditions of our contract with Lu'An and with sale of equipment, and that is not very wise for us to do that. I hope you give us a pass on that.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Thank you, Kevin.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask Seifi, as we're about to go into a period of time where we're going to start lapping COVID, it sounds like you still have some concerns about what that impact could be and so we shouldn't think of it as being maybe a tailwind for you in the coming quarters as we go through the harder parts of that. Is that correct or is there some other things or risks that you see in the outlook? So, that would be my first questions. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Vincent, good morning, first of all. Thank you for bringing your very tough question. I know that everybody is very optimistic, wants to be optimistic, all of us have been wanting to be optimistic -- in the summer when the number of cases had got down, the number of deaths were down and then you saw what happened. I have no idea what is going to happen. I hope that the vaccine and all of that will work, but there's still 4,000 people a day are dying, the number of cases is now -- has come down, but still there is 100,000 cases a day. I don't know whether there will be another round, there will be another variant and so on. So, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I know that everybody -- and believe me, us more than anybody else would love to be done with this COVID and go back to our normal lives, but I'm responsible for giving investors a balanced view of what we expect and I just don't want to run ahead of ourselves and tell everybody that everything is rosy. The part of the world, which is especially giving us problem is actually the United States of America. The volumes are down. So, I don't know how it will work out, but if it does for the better, then we are in a better shape. But we just may -- you can accuse us of being conservative, maybe we are, but we just want to have a balanced view, Vincent.
Vincent Andrews: That's fair enough. And just as a follow-up. There was elevated planned maintenance expense this quarter and the prior quarter. How should we be thinking about that over the next couple of quarters? Are you done with that or is there more to come?
Seifi Ghasemi: On that one, I would say that you should see the numbers become better as we go forward because a lot of the higher maintenance was driven by the refinery shutdowns and all of that. That's not our -- under our control. A lot of people took advantage of the COVID thing to have turnarounds. So, I'm hoping that those numbers will look better as we go forward.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Vincent.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort: Good morning, Seifi.
Simon Moore: Good morning, Bob. How are you this morning?
Bob Koort: I'm well, thank you. But I was a little confused in the commentary about COVID punishing your US business, where you note that you don't have a packaged gas business and yet that was the source of COVID pressure in Europe. So, is it something to do with the refining industry or could you give us a little more color on what particular end markets may be causing you trouble from a COVID standpoint in the Americas?
Seifi Ghasemi: Helium. We sell a lot of helium to MRI machines and to balloons and all of that. People are not doing elective surgeries, the volumes of helium is down and people are not having many parties and the general activity is down. So, that is one thing. And also the volumes on our hydrogen pipeline is down, some of it is because of the refineries being shut down, but overall the activity, people are not driving as much. So, those are the things that has been causing us trouble.
Bob Koort: Thank you. That's helpful. And then may I ask on Lu'An, and maybe you're reluctant to provide the specifics, but do you have comfort in knowing exactly why they haven't restarted and that gives you the confidence that it happens sometime? It would seem like coal gasification when oil has  rallied as much as it has may be more competitive, maybe a little more color there would be helpful.
Seifi Ghasemi: With respect to Lu'An, there are a lot of different -- you can put in the several different cases about why the plant is shut down, the re-organization and all of that, and I don't want to publicly talk about that because it has a reflection on the management of that company and I don't want to be negative on them. But the Lu'An situation did resolve itself, we are confident that that plant will restart and the arrangement that we have come with the company is accommodating us, accommodating them and they have a lot of new projects underway that we want to participate in. So, I'm not as worried about Lu'An as our investors seem to be, but we need to wait and see and we report to you what we know as of the time that we are reporting to you.
Bob Koort: Perfect, thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Thanks. Seifi, Jazan began starting up last quarter, I think. Where are they in the process of their ramp up?
Seifi Ghasemi: They are still commissioning the different units of the facility and we are obviously helping them. I believe -- I don't know the exact number, but we almost have close to 200 people helping them commission the facility. I'm not sure that crude has been officially introduced into the stream and that's a question that should be directed towards Saudi Aramco. But overall, we have, as I said, large number of people working with the Saudi team in a very productive way to start up the facility.
John Roberts: And then secondly, the refining industry is under a lot of pressure. Are your refining customers generally at minimum take on their contracts? And as they restructure here over the next several quarters or a couple of years, is there anything we need to look out for in terms of the integrity of their contracts?
Seifi Ghasemi: About the integrity of the contracts, no. The fact that our customers are not taking as much as they used to take before is a fact, as I told you, the volume in our pipeline in the Gulf Coast is down, but it's very regional. I mean, different parts of the world is different than, for example, in California, our pipeline volumes are doing okay. So, it depends on which region you are, but there is no question that overall people are not driving as much and therefore there is an impact on the refining industry that you know that better than I.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Good morning, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning. How are you, Jeff?
Jeff Zekauskas: Sorry. In terms of Jazan, what's the issue in the negotiation? That is, why wasn't the deal closed earlier and what are the issues that you're trying to work out in order to get to a resolution and how long do you think it might take?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the things that we have to discuss is, as I told you before, Jeff, one was the fact that when we initially negotiated the contract with Saudi Aramco, we expected a significantly higher interest rate for the $7.2 billion of debt that we have to finance. Today, because of the market condition, the actual interest rates are obviously lower than that. So, the issue that we have had to negotiate and we have negotiated that, but that is how much of that saving goes to each partner, that's basically it. I mean, we were assuming X amount of interest, now it is lower. Therefore, the -- so who gets the benefit of it and how much of it. So, that was one issue in terms of negotiation. The second thing is that we are trying to arrange $7.2 billion of debt. That is not an easy task with a lot of banks involved and all of that, and that -- the terms, conditions and all of that. So, those are the two issues that we need to work out. In terms of how long it takes, I think -- I'm hoping that we will be done with this thing by the May, June, but it takes time and it is unpredictable. There is a lot of factors. This is a geopolitical thing. The view of the banks changes every day, the view of Saudi Aramco changes every day. So, I'm not pessimistic, I'm actually optimistic, I think we will get this thing done at some point in time. But the issue -- those are the two issues that we are working on. I think one of them, we have worked on. I think we have an understanding with the senior management of Aramco in terms of what we are going to do in terms of sharing of the profit, but the devil is in the details. All of this has to be translated into actual contract language and the debt has to be arranged. So, that's what is taking time.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then my -- thank you for that. My second question is, I guess, a question of clarification to Scott. Scott, when you were reviewing the Americas business, did you say that you thought the -- either the operating income or the EBITDA in the second quarter would look like the first?
Seifi Ghasemi: Scott, would you please answer that, I don't remember --?
Scott Crocco: Sure. Happy to. Yes, yes. Thanks, Jeff, for the question, I appreciate it. And my comment, that was regarding the maintenance spending. And as Seifi mentioned, those terms are driven by when our customers take turnarounds, planned turnarounds. So, it's a technical term here. And the spending on that and the expenses that we'll incur, it's kind of lumpy. And my comment in there is for the second quarter, not be surprised if we see the same sort of level of maintenance that we saw in the first quarter.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Scott Crocco: You're welcome.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citi.
PJ Juvekar: Yes. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, PJ. How are you this morning?
PJ Juvekar: Doing well. Doing well. So, question on Lu'An. You mentioned that you have three other gasifiers that are running in China. So, wondering, what is the underlying issue with Lu'An? Is it just -- is it -- looks like it's company specific, and is it that it's not profitable at current coal price or is it the downstream process into fuels that that is an issue, can you just shed some light on that?
Seifi Ghasemi: PJ, number one, we have four other gasify -- gasification projects that are working. They -- it is a specific issue related to Lu'An. And as much as people would like to -- me to convert that into economic region, I think it has to do, and I need -- as I said, I need to be careful because I don't want to say anything kind of implying that there is a little bit of a confusion with the management there. So -- but the state of Shanxi has decided to consolidate all of the chemical facilities into one facility. They have new people and all of that. And those people have said they want to look at everything and look at our options and all of that. That is more of a reason for keeping the plant shut down than anything to do economically and all of that. But the fact that coal prices are higher in China significantly in the last few months because of the winter and the fact that the parent company can sell coal, I mean, you can make a lot of theoretical argument, but it's just basically that the new management is taking their time trying to assess their options.
PJ Juvekar: Okay, thank you for that.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Thank you.
PJ Juvekar: And then just quickly on your EMEA. You have a packaged gas business down in Europe. Would you say that post-COVID that that business will have the most upside recovery? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, it will. Yes, it will. By the -- I have to say that our team in Europe is doing a wonderful job. The results that they have produced last quarter considering what's going on there is very, very good. They have their act together, they keep pushing the pricing and they are doing a very good job. But if COVID goes away, there is significant upside there, yes, absolutely.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Good morning, Seifi. How are you?
Seifi Ghasemi: Hey, David. How are you? Other than being buried until -- under 32 inches of snow, I'm perfectly fine.
David Begleiter: Are you? I'm doing well, thank you. Seifi, just on Jazan. How soon after the issue is resolved and the deals are completed, the contract is signed can the project come online and start-up?
Seifi Ghasemi: The day that we do the financial close, we are online. Whether the refinery is online or not, our theory is a fixed tier seating as you now like other the deals. So, the day that we do the financial closing, the next day we will see the benefit of the EPS on our bottom line.
David Begleiter: Understood.
Seifi Ghasemi: So you need to look for the announcement about the financial close. Yes?
David Begleiter: Okay. And just on potential new green hydrogen projects, I know you're working on them. Is there potential for another announcements this year on green hydrogen?
Seifi Ghasemi: David, I'm not going to go there. I have no idea. I mean, we are working on other projects and all of that. But for me to be that specific would be -- would not be responsible and those things are very big projects. We are working on other projects, but to be that specific, I can't do that, you need to give me a pass on that too.
David Begleiter: Understood. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, David.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hey, Seifi. I'm buried in snow as well in Cleveland, but in terms of…
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, Mike.
Mike Sison: In -- how are you doing? In terms of EPS growth, you did a nice job in 2020. Can you still generate some EPS growth in '21? I know you can't give any specifics, but the model seems to be built to be able to do that on an annualized basis. So, then has the growth algorithm changed at all longer-term in terms of what you think you could do in terms of EPS growth?
Seifi Ghasemi: No. We still believe that on the average in the next five or six years, we will deliver about 10%, the same way that we had done in the last six years. My view hasn't changed on that. That is our goal and we will make that happen, and we'll do our best to make it happen.
Mike Sison: Great.
Seifi Ghasemi:  fundamental structural reason that -- yes, go ahead.
Mike Sison: Yes. Just any comments on '21 in terms of your ability to grow?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, in '21, if -- quite frankly if COIVD subsides, Lu'An starts and we close on Jazan at a reasonable time, then the 10% increase should not be too much of a problem. It depends.
Mike Sison: Got it.
Seifi Ghasemi: We are not giving any guidance, not only because of COVID, but also because of these -- these two big things can have an effect. So, we just need to be a little bit patient to see how everything works out. But we obviously, and I'm very optimistic about the future of Air Products, for sure, that's why I bought a lot of shares in December as you know. So, I'm -- personally, I'm very optimistic, but we have to give you a balanced picture here.
Mike Sison: Got it. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. Seifi, you mentioned that your hydrogen pipeline on the US Gulf has slowed, but in California, it remains firm. I was just curious, whether that is potentially a bit of an end market difference, you have some of the refineries in California converting their hydrotreaters and hydrocrackers over to renewable diesel and just wanted to hear your view on whether there is a potential longer-term opportunity here to Air Products if there is a kind of an expansion of that renewable diesel opportunity globe -- or nationwide rather than just California, whether the net use of hydrogen per unit of diesel versus per unit of renewable diesel is meaningfully different?
Seifi Ghasemi: Steve, you have a very good insight. That's a very good observation. We don't want to talk about it too much because that is really not our business. But fundamentally, what you are saying -- all of the things that you're saying are correct and that can actually be an upside for us. Yes. I agree with all of your statements.
Steve Byrne: Okay. And Seifi, I remember a couple of years back, you made a comment about the number of gasification projects that were being considered and, I believe I was just trying to -- and the number, if I recall correctly, was more than 50. I just wonder, whether -- a lot of those may have been kind of idled or reconsidered over this past year, given much lower crude and whether or not you're seeing any pickup in that activity and those discussions going forward now that we've seen a recovery in crude?
Seifi Ghasemi: There are significant number of coal gasification projects under consideration, not only in China, but also in India and Indonesia. Those are the places that we see the most activity. And we expected -- I think with COVID, everybody pulled back as you know very well in terms of capital expenditure and so on. But as time goes by, we do -- we are optimistic about gasification. We have a very, very strong position there. Quite frankly, we are by far the market leader. And if there is another gasification project in the world, I would bet you 90% of their products we will get that. So, I think that we continue to be optimistic about that.
Steve Byrne: Okay, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, the first one would just be on Jazan. It sounds like when you -- at least based on your discussion of kind of what the sticking points are, it sounds like as soon as this thing does get to the finish line that the overall profitability that you were expecting is pretty much on line with your original expectations. Is that fair or has anything else changed when you think about the terms or anything like that?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, good morning, John. Hope you're well. And secondly, your statement is totally accurate. That means that as soon as this thing is done, we will see the impact on our bottom line, kind of in line with what you would expect.
John McNulty: Got it. Perfect. And then, I guess, with regard to the Americas, I guess, admittedly, we were a little bit confused on the volume weakness, where you're kind of seeing the same declines as you saw kind of at the heat of COVID kind of in the June quarter. So, I guess, why haven't things gotten better? Like when we look at the macro, it looks like it has improved. So, I guess, is it just a function of the seasonality of refining and maybe that's kind of, whatever maybe that, that's the part of the reason to blame? I guess, I don't quite understand why the Americas isn't getting -- at least from quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter getting better at this point?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, I'll provide you an answer and then I would like Scott to comment on that if he wants. But the biggest impacts are maintenance costs. The second significant impact is lower helium volumes. And the third impact is that that the refineries have slowed down a bit. Those are -- and the fourth one is that the US economy is still struggling, my friend. I mean, everybody is talking about these great rosy things, but on the ground, we don't see that yet. So, those are the four reasons. Scott, you want to make any further comments?
Scott Crocco: No, I agree with that. And just to also point out, like I said in the prepared remarks that there is some seasonality on a sequential basis. But as you mentioned, Seifi, there's the underlying economy, there's the COVID helium situation. So, I just agree with what you said.
John McNulty: Thanks very much for the color.
Scott Crocco: All the different businesses will act differently, but when -- as there is improvement in the economy, COVID and otherwise, we expect to see a lumpy, as things restart and so forth as opposed to a steady increase.
John McNulty: Got it. Fair enough, thanks a lot guys.
Scott Crocco: Yes.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Chris Parkinson: Good morning, Seifi. It's great to hear you're doing all well. I just have two brief ones. Just first as it pertains to the carbon capture opportunities, do you just have a brief update on your perspective addressable market, any internal projects and also just anything on how you could potentially work with third parties given your tech expertise?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, good morning, Chris. Hope you're well. Chris, the carbon capture opportunities are being driven, the things look even rosier than before because one thing is capturing carbon to help environment and all of that, but there is a significant push right now. As I talked to the investors in the last year and a half last, last two years, that the transition to the hydrogen economy will be grey hydrogen, then blue hydrogen and then green hydrogen. There is a significant demand now for so-called blue hydrogen that people are thinking about making ammonia where you capture the CO2 that is generated, then you make the hydrogen. And, therefore, the ammonia is called blue and then especially Japan wants to take that ammonia and blow it directly into their boilers for their power plants. And that is how they are going to decarbonize. So, there is significant demand, a lot of conversations about so-called blue ammonia and blue hydrogen and all of that. We are working on carbon capture. We continue to work on carbon capture. And as I said, we will in time announce appropriate projects of meaningful size to show you that we are making progress on this thing. This is something I've been talking to you about for three, four years. It takes -- just like in NEOM, it takes five or six years to develop these projects. So, we are working on them and hopefully we will have some news for you in the years to come.
Chris Parkinson: We'll certainly look forward to that. And the second very brief question, just in the second half, a lot of local media in India and Indonesia are reporting that you're actively bidding on a lot of projects, and on the latter of which we've obviously already heard some constructive news. Can you just possibly speak to just the magnitude of those opportunities and the rough timeline, given it seems like you've already bid? Is that something we could potentially expect in fiscal year '21 or should we still be kind of more methodical and more balanced with our expectations on those fronts? Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Chris, thank you very much for the question. Chris, one of the things that one does in life is that you learn from your past experience, right. We have gotten a lot of hot  because we announced Jazan before it was a done deal and now you see every quarter we have to explain. So, in Indonesia, we are obviously talking about gasification projects in Indonesia. We have been telling you we have been doing that for the past 3.5 years. I met the ministers there four years ago. But we haven't done anything that is announce-able yet. We have talked to people, we have talked about projects and all of that, and we don't want to do anything, again, like Jazan to come and say, oh, we have signed a memorandum of understanding and all of that and then every quarter have to explain why it didn't become a project. These projects are very complex. It depends on the actions of a lot of government agencies. It changes the course of some of the countries. There are significant impacts on people who import product, who now are not going to be importing product. It's very complex and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I have read all of those reports, I've seen all of those reports, but we just want to be responsible and we will announce something when we think it's going to be a real project rather than just the discussions. And I hope you have some patience with us, Chris.
Chris Parkinson: I certainly will. Thank you very much for the color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.
Jonas Oxgaard: Good morning, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning. How are you?
Jonas Oxgaard: Living the dream every day. I was going to pick a little bit -- of course. I was going to pick a little bit more at the Lu'An scab here. So, you mentioned that you have high confidence that it's going to restart, but what happens if it doesn't? Is that part of your negotiations? And is there a signed agreement with the new management there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, if we never -- so, you're talking about what if the plant never starts?
Jonas Oxgaard: Yes.
Seifi Ghasemi: We have agreed with a reduced fee. We will wait another -- as long as it takes for a few quarters to see whether they restart or not. But if they come and say, we are never going to start this plant, then we have a contract, we will go to court and enforce our contract. Our contract is very clear about what happens if customer shuts down. It is very clear, it is very defendable and we are very confident about the outcome of that. But we didn't want to go to court and start enforcing that because we don't know what -- the customer has never told us that they are shutting this thing down permanently. And we didn't want to prematurely destroy our relationship with the customer. So, it's a matter of being patient and working with your customer. I mean, it is -- next year at this time, and they haven't even started yet and they send us a letter that they are going to mothball the plant, then we go to court and enforce our contract.
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, Jon?
Jonas Oxgaard: Second question, if you don't mind, on hydrogen. Your competitors and even companies who, I guess, aren't really considered competitors are approaching hydrogen much more tentatively, right. Your -- one of your competitors inaugurated their first 20 megawatt electrolyzer last -- or this week, but you're going from, well, I wouldn't say, zero, but close to zero to 1.3 gigs in one fell swoop. Can you talk about what, like, the reason why you're so confident that you can do this mega project without baby step first and how are you different from the rest?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the way we are different is the same thing with gasification and everything, Jonas. But the main reason that we are doing what we are doing is that we want to be competitive and put our customers in a competitive position to use green hydrogen. You cannot do that at small scale. The scale up that we are doing is that as if -- it's not as if you are taking a technological risk, we are not. I mean, what are we doing at NEOM? We are building, yes, 4 gigawatts, 3.5, 4 gigawatts of wind and solar. That's known technology, it's no big deal. Then we are building 650 ton a day electrolyzers. And everybody says, oh my god, yes, but how are we doing that, we are going to take 30 of those 20 megawatt things that you said and put them together. So, there is no risk in there. And then the ammonia plant we are building a 1 million ton ammonia plants all over the place. So, we are not taking any technological risks, what we are doing is that we are creating a mega project, so that we get the benefit of the economy of scale. That's number one. And then the second thing is that out of these people who are announcing these different plans, the source of electricity is not green and we are creating a green source of electricity. But the main thing is we are doing mega projects because that is how you, number one, make it economically feasible. And number two, unless somebody like us makes a commitment to make a big project, people are not going to convert. I mean, if you own buses in San Francisco, you are not going to go and convert them to fuel cell vehicles if you don't have an assurance that you will have the green hydrogen to put in them. Then what's the point of converting? So, when you know that somebody is spending $6 billion, $7 billion to build the infrastructure, then you get the confidence. That is the difference in terms of what we are doing and what they are doing. It's not a big technological risk, but it's being the first and being the people the first ones who developed the infrastructure. I mean, I don't want to make big comparisons here, but what is to making an electric car, I mean, my god, it's a motor and a gearbox, right. But look at what Tesla is and look at what the GM and Volkswagen are, those guys took the decision, went first, and everybody said, well, this is not going to work out because it's no big deal, GM can do this anytime. Well, look at where their stock is and where the GM stock is. There is significant advantage to be the first mover and you have to move on a bigger scale in order to make it economical for your customers to have confidence that you are going to have the product when they convert their fleet. So, that is what we are doing. I have no comment about what our competitors are doing. They are -- I'm sure they are very smart people, and people like yourself will question them about what they are doing and what they are not doing, and I don't want to make any comment on them. But for sure, we know, I hope we know what we are doing and what we are doing is go for a scale, go for economy of scale when you have the opportunity and produce a real green hydrogen, not these toy things at 10 ton and 20 ton a day. That really doesn't -- but besides that, we are doing those things. We are building a 30 ton a day plant hydrogen in Port Arthur. We are building 30 tons plant hydrogen in other parts of the world. So, that's not a big deal, but the mega scale is the future. Okay, Jon?
Jonas Oxgaard: Thank you. Absolutely.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
Operator: And there are currently no other questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Seifi for any additional remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, once again, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for listening to our presentation, and thanks for your good questions. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. As I said earlier, please stay safe and healthy. And all the best to all of you and your families. Thank you, again.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-11-11 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call.  Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved.  
 Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Simon Moore: Thank you, Liane. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.  
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2. 
 In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and ROCE, both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and return on capital employed. Reconciliations of these measures to our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.  
 Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good day to everyone. As always, we thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. Before we talk about our results this quarter, I would like to take -- to talk about 2020.  
 Please turn to Slide #3. I continue to believe that the true character and leadership of individuals and companies are revealed during times of crisis. And unfortunately, the world continues to be challenged by the COVID-19 crisis. Our #1 priority has always been a safety and well-being of our people. We continue to provide them the necessary protective equipment and the right protocols to uphold their safety and health. I want to thank our employees for following these procedures and working hard to serve our customers and execute significant projects under challenging conditions. Throughout COVID-19 crisis, we have not reduced staff nor reduced the salaries of our people, and we remain committed to that course of action. Our people continue to do a great job in keeping all of our 750 plants running around the world. Meanwhile, our corporate and business functions continue to run smoothly and productively. Recognizing the greater needs during this time of crisis, we also had increased our commitment to our local communities through our volunteerism and financial support. 
 Our robust business model continues to prove its resilience globally, as our onsite business remains stable, as we have mentioned before. In addition, we have maintained our focus on pricing discipline despite the lower volumes. And as you can see, our merchant business developed improved pricing in all of the regions. 
 We were very proud to announce the $7 billion NEOM carbon-free hydrogen project which will enable Air Products to supply truly carbon-free hydrogen to power buses and trucks around the world when it comes on stream in 2025. This revolutionary and forward-looking project will demonstrate, on a massive and commercial scale, the possibility of a transportation system of the future based on a totally carbon-free source of energy that is a green hydrogen. 
 We also signed a long-term onsite contract for a world-scale coal-to-methanol facility in Indonesia. This significant project supports Indonesia's focus on energy independence and will produce nearly 2 million tons per year of methanol when on a stream in 2024. We are very excited about the potential for additional opportunities in Indonesia.  
 Now please turn to Slide #4. We continue to create and win mega projects around the world that help our customers meet their most pressing needs for cleaner energy and environmental solutions, and we expect these projects to drive our growth for decades to come. This year, these projects included our largest ever investment in the United States, for the Gulf Coast ammonia project in Texas, the acquisition of 5 operating hydrogen plants and a long-term hydrogen supply agreement with PBF Energy in California and Delaware, and multiple onsite projects for electronics manufacturers in China and Malaysia. We also began construction of 3 nitrogen plants in the Netherlands and brought on stream a steam methane reformer and cold box in Louisiana to supply products to our U.S. Gulf Coast pipeline system. We are delighted to be selected for these large new projects, demonstrating our customers' confidence in our complete solution: deliver safely, on time and on budget.  
 Now please turn to Slide #5. Our industry-leading LNG technology was selected for major projects in Mozambique, Qatar and Algeria. Our business model supports and enables our strong financial position. And we successfully raised about $5 billion of debt earlier this year to ensure we are ready for our exciting growth opportunities. We have significant balance sheet capacity remaining and are continuing to build strong positions in growth markets. With the Board's focus on cleaner energy, we see gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen creating profitable growth opportunities for Air Products for many years to come.  
 With our strong cash flow, we continue to complement our growth investments by returning cash directly to shareholders through our dividend. And we made new commitments to sustainability, the environment, which I will speak about in a moment.  
 Now please turn to Slide #6. I'm very pleased that our team stayed focused and worked safely throughout these challenging years. We obviously always want to see no accidents or incidents. but I'm pleased to see improvement versus our fiscal year '19 safety performance.  
 By following Slide #7, 8 and 9, you can see our goal, management philosophy and 5-point plan that we have shared with you many times before. While I'm not going to go through the details of each of these slides, since you have seen them many times before, I have included them as a continuing reminder of Air Products' unwavering focus on cash generation and implementation of our well-defined strategy.  
 Now please turn to Slide #10, which is our higher purpose. We are obviously committed to delivering superior financial performance. But our people also know they are supporting the higher purpose in the work they do every day. Our higher purpose at Air Products is to bring people together from all over the world so that they can collaborate and develop innovative solutions to some of the most significant energy and environmental challenges we all face. That is our higher purpose, and it inspires our team and drives us every day. 
 In support of our higher purpose and consistent with our focus on sustainability and environment, on Slide 11, you can see our new diversity goals, also. By 2025, Air Products aims to achieve at least 28% female representation in the professional and managerial population globally, and at least 20% minority representation in that same population in the United States. Our growth projects give us a unique opportunity to bring diverse talent into the company. And as we measure our progress, we will continually stretch and drive for further improvement. We also recently launched a legal advocacy program for racial and identity discrimination matters. Through this novel program, Air Products support employees and their dependents, who have been subject to this -- to such discrimination outside the workplace. These are a few of the specific steps we are taking to continue building our culture of inclusion and belonging.  
 Now please turn to Slide #12. When you can see our Third by '30 goal, which means that we intend to reduce our carbon emissions intensity by 1/3 by 2030. As I discussed the subject in September, this goal focuses on reducing emissions relative to the amount of energy that we are delivering to the world. It is fully aligned with our business' strategy. It is near term and measurable and hold us accountable for delivering.  
 Now please go to Slide #13, when we show you the key opportunities we have to achieve the Third by '30 goal. One very important point is that this goal is enabled by and consistent with our profitable business growth opportunities. Carbon capture, carbon-free hydrogen, low-carbon projects, operational excellence and renewable energy all support our Third by '30 goal.  
 Now please turn to Slide #14, which highlights our key gasification projects. The fundamental drivers for gasification are still valid and very relevant today. Countries and large companies around the world continue to focus on gasification to convert abundant natural resources like coal, pet coke and refinery bottoms, all of these low-value raw materials into high-value chemicals, transportation fuels and energy in a sustainable manner using gasification.  
 At this point, I think it's appropriate to specifically give you an update on our largest gasification project, the acquisition of gasifiers and power plants from Saudi Aramco in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. We continue to work diligently to complete the financing and close all the open contractual terms. But as a result of the COVID-19 situation, these activities are taking much longer than we anticipated. Therefore, I would like to repeat on this call what I said on another public call in June of 2020, that it is my strong advice to investors is to please do not count your chickens until they are hatcheted as it relates to this acquisition. We will only close on this acquisition if the terms and conditions of the final contract, and the expected financial returns are in line with our expectations.  
 Now please turn to Slide #15, where you can see that we have grown our EPS, which is earnings per share, by over 10% on average over the last 6 years.  
 And then Slide #16 is a reminder that while we are continuing to develop these exciting growth opportunities, we have also grown our dividend by 10% on average over the last 6 years. This continues our record of raising the dividend every year for the past 30 years, and we will provide about $1.2 billion in dividends to our shareholders this year.  
 And finally, Slide #17 shows our EBITDA margin, which is obviously my favorite slide, where it shows that the margin is up over 1,500 basis points since 2014 and more than 40% EBITDA margin for the sixth consecutive quarter despite the COVID-19 challenges this year.  
 I would like to thank all of our dedicated and hard-working people around the world for staying focused on safely operating more than 750 facilities around the world and serving our customers. Thank you again.  
 Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President -- our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to provide a financial overview. Scott? 
M. Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi stated earlier, our company continues to demonstrate our strengths despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. We have made significant progress in committing our capital, announcing mega projects in gasification and hydrogen for mobility and completing a highly successful $5 billion debt offering. Both of these will support our long-term growth. We also won several world-scale LNG heat exchanger projects, which will add to our profit over the next few years. Meanwhile, our business, which is more than half onsite, continued to deliver profit growth and stable cash flow in a difficult year.  
 Now please turn to Slide 18 for more details on our full year results. Our profits and margins grew despite the adverse effects of COVID-19. EBITDA was up 4%, and EBITDA margin increased 200 basis points. Sales were roughly flat at almost $9 billion as the combined 5% gain in volume and price were offset by nonoperational factors. Specifically, the lower energy pass-through and the India contract modification together decreased sales by 5%, but had no real profit impact. 
 The volume growth was primarily driven by acquisitions, new plants and higher sale of equipment activities, including LNG, which, overall, more than offset the negative COVID-19 impact. We estimate COVID-19 reduced our sales by about 4% and our EPS by about $0.60 to $0.65 for the year. Price improved in all 3 regions and across most major product lines. Price was also the largest contributor to the 200 basis point increase in the EBITDA margin. ROCE was 140 basis points lower, negatively impacted by the step-up in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt.  
 Now please turn to Slide 19. Our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.17 or 2% driven by the strong $0.77 per share increase in price, the third consecutive year of price improvement. Volume declined $0.19 as the negative COVID-19 impact was partially offset by acquisitions, new plants and higher sale of equipment activities. Different business mix caused volume to be positive on sales, but negative on profits. Again, we estimate COVID-19 reduced full year EPS by about $0.60 to $0.65. 
 Against this challenging backdrop, we continue to add resources to support our future growth and to maintain our facilities. This is 1 reason why our other costs were negative $0.38. Currency was unfavorable, $0.07, primarily due to the weaker Chinese RMB, Chilean peso and South Korean won. 
 Our joint ventures also had strong underlying business results. Equity affiliate income and noncontrolling interest together added $0.08. Interest expense was $0.10 favorable. We adopted new accounting guidance this year that moves about $9 million from interest expense to nonoperating expense each quarter. The impact of this reclass, lower underlying debt balance and lower interest rates were partially offset by the cost of our $5 billion debt issuance. 
 Nonoperating expense was $0.15 unfavorable due to the accounting change I just mentioned and a reduction in interest income. Our effective tax rate of 19.1% roughly equaled last year, and we expect an effective tax rate of 20% to 21% in FY '21.  
 Now please turn to Slide 20 for a brief discussion of our fourth quarter results. I'll start by commenting on our results versus Q3. Volumes grew 8% sequentially, supported by increased sale of equipment project activities and improved merchant volume as economies across the regions gradually began to improve. Price also continued to improve, up 1%. EBITDA rose 6% sequentially, primarily due to the higher volume, better equity affiliate income and favorable currencies. However, these benefits were partially offset by higher costs mainly due to additional growth resource investments and increased planned maintenance, particularly in Americas. As we mentioned last quarter, some of these customer planned maintenance outages were delayed from earlier in FY '20. And EPS was up 9%, with the lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense.  
 Now turning to our results versus last year. Sales of $2.3 billion were up 2% driven by price, with improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gain. Volume was stable as the additions of new plants, acquisitions and increased sales of equipment activities, compensated for the shortfalls attributable to COVID-19, customer plan outages and the end of a short-term contract in Asia, which contributed last year. EBITDA of almost $940 million was 2% lower than prior year's level driven by business mix and higher cost, partially offset by favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income. Volume was flat in sales, but unfavorable in EBITDA due to product mix. EBITDA margin remained above 40%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter EBITDA margin exceeded 40%. Operating income was down 7%, greater than the decline in EBITDA due to higher depreciation on new plants, including the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired earlier this year. COVID-19 reduced overall sales by about 5% and EPS by about $0.15 to $0.20.  
 Now please turn to Slide 21. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $2.19 was down $0.08 per share or 4% with unfavorable volume and cost, partially offset by favorable price and tax rate. Volume was unfavorable, $0.22, primarily due to COVID-19. Cost was unfavorable $0.13 as we added new resources for future growth and increased planned maintenance. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.03, primarily due to the euro, Chinese RMB and British pound. The effective tax rate of 16.8% was down 340 basis points and had a positive $0.09 impact. This was driven by higher share-based compensation benefits and a tax benefit associated with the PBF acquisition. As stated previously, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 20% to 21% in fiscal year '21. Equity affiliate income and noncontrolling interest together were up $0.06 due to strong underlying business results. Interest expense was $0.03 unfavorable as the cost associated with the additional $5 billion of debt was partially offset by the previously mentioned accounting reclass. This reclass also primarily drove the unfavorable $0.04 in nonoperating expense.
 Now please turn to Slide 22. We continue to generate strong cash flow, underscoring the stability of our business. Our higher EBITDA supported higher cash taxes driven by timing, and higher maintenance CapEx driven, in part, by spending on our new corporate headquarters. For the full fiscal year 2020, our distributable cash flow of $2.6 billion or about $12 per share is comparable to prior year. From this distributable cash flow, we paid over 40% or $1.1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have nearly $1.5 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. 
 Slide #23 provides additional details on our capital deployment. We have substantial investment capacity remaining. Some of the spending in our backlog extends beyond FY '22. And we will generate more cash and borrowing capacity as projects come on stream. We expect to reframe this potential for you in 2021. As you can see, we expect almost $18 billion of investment capacity available over the 5-year period from FY '18 through FY '22. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, about $3 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22, and over $5 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. With a few new projects signed, and some coming on stream, our total project and M&A commitments remain around $12.5 billion, with about $11 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent 30% and already committed over 90% of the capacity we show here.  
 Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. Before I talk about Asia, I would like to make a few comments about our overall performance. I'm very proud to say that our teams have performed exceptionally well, responding to the current crisis. All 3 regions continue to deliver strong pricing and our full year EBITDA margins increased in each geographic segment despite the significant COVID-19 impact. I have full confidence that our teams will execute our business strategy and run our businesses very efficiently in the coming months. 
 Now please turn to Slide 24, which is our results in Asia. Compared to last year, our fourth quarter volumes were down 5% mainly due to the continuing adverse effect of COVID-19, the impact of a customer outage and a short-term contract that contributed last year. Pricing was positive for the 14th, and I'd like to repeat, 14th consecutive quarter And EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.3%. 
 Now I think it's appropriate if I give you more information about the customer outage that I just mentioned. In Asia, our largest customer is Lu'An, a coal-to-liquid facility in China. After successfully operating, for over 2 years, the customer scheduled a planned shutdown, and I'd like to stress, planned shutdown of that facility for a normal and expected maintenance turnaround earlier in 2020, actually in June 2020. We successfully completed this major maintenance activity by the end of September, so that, that is the negative impact for our results that I just mentioned. In the last quarter, the plant was basically down on -- for scheduled maintenance. But I also would like to add that as of today that I'm speaking, our customer has not yet formally asked us to restart the plant due to COVID-19 and market conditions. Any further delay in the restart of this facility will obviously have an impact on our sales to this customer in fiscal year 2021, and we are in the process of working with the customer on this issue. We will update you on the status of this situation when we announce our first quarter results in January 2021.
 Now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk to you about our Americas results. Scott? 
M. Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 25 for a review of our Americas results. Sequentially, merchant recovery and the full quarter impact of the PBF hydrogen plants acquisition more than offset the planned maintenance outages and drove volume 4% higher. Price was also up 1% with improvements across key product lines. EBITDA was flat as increased planned maintenance activities offset the positive volume and price impact. Compared to prior year, volumes were down 3%, primarily driven by the effect of COVID-19. While planned maintenance outages of our hydrogen facilities were largely offset by the PBF acquisition. Maintenance outages postponed by our customers from earlier in the year, and some modest repairs due to damage caused by Hurricane Laura increased our maintenance activities this quarter. Americas' strong pricing trend continued, up 2% versus last year for the segment or 5% for merchant. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Price was better across all major product lines. As expected, the onsite business, which accounts for about 2/3 of the region's sales, remained stable. EBITDA of $411 million remained unchanged from last year as better price and the PBF acquisition compensated for lower merchant volumes and higher planned maintenance activities. EBITDA margin was up 110 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by price. While sequentially, margin was down 340 basis points mainly on increased maintenance.
 Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon? 
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide 26 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region results. Sales increased 18% sequentially driven by an 11% increase in volume and 6% favorable currency. Merchant recovery and acquisitions both supported the double-digit volume improvement, while currencies were due to the favorable euro and British pound. EBITDA also climbed 18% sequentially driven by the volume uplift together with favorable currency and seasonally better equity affiliate results. Costs were unfavorable, primarily due to planned maintenance outages in our hydrogen facilities and higher power costs, which we expect to recover in the future. Compared to last year, volumes remained flat as acquisitions and other growth offset the adverse impact of COVID-19 and the planned maintenance outages. Also compared to last year, price was again up, increasing 2% for the region or 4% for merchants, with improvement across all subregions. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. EBITDA of $200 million was up 4%, supported by strong price and favorable currency, but partially offset by product mix and increased maintenance costs. 
 Now please turn to Slide 27, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment business as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activities, but profit is lower due to business mix and higher project development investments.  
 Please turn to Slide 28, Corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter, driven by LNG project activities, including the Golden Pass and Mozambique LNG projects. During the fourth quarter, we were also awarded the massive Qatar gas project and the replacement project for Sonatrach, which will both further add to our results in the near future.
 Now to provide some additional thoughts on the future, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. As we look forward, unfortunately, we continue to see COVID-19 crisis deepening and adversely affecting the people and economies of most of the world. When I spoke to you in late April of 2020, the daily cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. were about 35,000 and the number of worldwide cases per day was about 80,000. Today, this situation is a lot worse. The number of cases in the U.S. is around 120,000. And for the world, it's almost 600,000 cases a day. Therefore, it is very difficult, if not just plain impossible, to make any reasonable projection about the course of economic activity around the world as we move forward. Therefore, we are not providing earnings per share guidance or CapEx guidance for our fiscal year 2021. We hope the outlook is less uncertain in January. And if that is the case, we will provide guidance. We are not shying away from guidance, but we are being very open with you that we just don't know as we sit here today in terms of what the course of economic activity will be.  
 However, I want to share with you what we are seeing so far this quarter, that is the month of October and as of today in November. A 52% of our sales, that is our onsite business is doing well, and we expect this to continue. The other 48% is our merchant business around the world, and this is where we are today in each area. In Asia, our merchant volumes are approximately where they were at this time last year. So Asia has recovered, and we see good results there. In Europe, we are seeing the impact of the recent COVID-19 surge with merchant volumes down 5% to 10% as of today versus last year mainly due to our packaged gases business in Europe. In Americas, unfortunately due to the significant increase in COVID-19 cases, merchant volumes are down about 5%. And I would like to remind you that we do not have a packaged gases business in North America.  
 And now please turn to Slide #29. Every day, but certainly in these challenging times, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. Our business model and strong financial position will allow us to continue to execute our strategy and create long-term value for our shareholders, including the growth of our dividend. We are committed to the growth of our dividend every year. The projects in our backlog are moving forward as expected. And we continue to create and win some of the world's most significant projects. And as we do, we will continue to protect our people's health and safety and take care of their welfare and the welfare of their families. We are 100% committed to that.  
 In closing, I want to say thank you. First, to all of our employees around the world for their dedication and commitment. Our employees are playing a critical role and making a difference to the world during these challenging times. I also want to express my thanks to our customers. Innovating alongside you, our customers, we serve our higher purpose, supplying products that benefit the environment and help you to be more efficient and sustainable. Thank you for your continued confidence and trust in us. And finally, to our local communities around the world, I want you to know that we will continue to support you and stand together with you, especially during these difficult times.  
 Now we are pleased to answer any questions that you might have. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Seifi, I have a question about the Jazan project. Is the sole issue, the financing of the project? Or are there unclarities in the financial terms with Aramco that need to be settled? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Jeff. Yes, that's an excellent question. This is a very big acquisition, $12 billion. Supporting documentation for this thing is -- I'm not exaggerating too much, about 4,000 or 5,000 pages. I cannot represent to you that we have agreed to every single term and dotted every T and crossed every I. There are still items that lawyers are going back and forth on this project. That is why I felt very strongly that I should be very upfront with our investors, as we always are, to tell you exactly where we are. We are not done with this thing. Financing is still going on. As you know, we launched the financing back in July. That is proceeding. But the whole thing is not 100% done, and I just wanted to be very clear with the investors exactly where we are. That's our job at these calls to tell you exactly where we are and how we see things. Now the situation can change 2 weeks from now, and we can announce that we have signed this thing. But I just want you to know that as of right now, this is where we are. 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. And with the Lu'An project, since there's a -- I don't know, there's some volatility in Air Products' financial return, does that mean that the Lu'An project isn't structured as a conventional onsite contract, in that if you were receiving a fixed fee or something like that, there wouldn't be that volatility? Can you explain the difference between the Lu'An contract and a standard onsite contract? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Again, that's an excellent question. The different contracts we have around the world are not exactly the same. With Lu'An, the only -- one of the differences is that we have agreed with the customer that during the times of planned shutdown -- this is a very complex facility, I'm sure you know better than I do, that once every 2 or 3 years, you have to shut it down and do a complete maintenance. We have been running that -- this facility at 99% capacity for 2.5 years. Therefore, there was time to shut it down. We shut it down in June, and it took us about 3 months to do a maintenance, which is the largest maintenance of a gasification facility around the world. We very successfully completed that. But our agreement with the customer was during the planned shutdown, we wouldn't charge them a fee, during planned shutdown. Does that help? 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Yes. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. 
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Just just a follow-up on Lu'An. If they decide not to restart it because of economics, would that nonpayment continue forward as part of this? Or would that take-or-pay start to kick in? And I guess the corollary to that is if you just put all the capital in to kind of refurb it, how far out of the money are they on economics with that plant today and what needs to happen for that to move to a better economic situation? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Again, Duffy, as I said, we feel obligated to tell you exactly where we are right now. We are not indicating with you guys that there is any significant issue with this facility. They had to shut down, and they -- as of right now, they haven't asked us to start it up. If they never shut it down, they have an enforceable contract and we will go and they have to live up to the contract terms and conditions that we have like any other facility. As you know, the other day, Shell announced that they are going to shut down their refinery in Convent, in Louisiana. So over there, we supply them, we have a contract, we'll deal with that. So what we are trying to tell you is that, look, this is the situation with this customer. Because it is a very big customer, I felt obligated to bring that up to the attention of the investors. 
Duffy Fischer: Very fair. And then maybe just on the actual results for the quarter. If you look margin step down from Q3 to Q4, even though the COVID hit was bigger in Q3 than it was in Q4. So as we think about going forward and modeling for 2021, is the margin structure of Q4 more indicative of a baseline we should use? Or was Q3 more indicative? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, it obviously depends on COVID and all of that. I think Q3 is more indicative than Q4. But fundamentally, Duffy, there is one other thing that is going on, which I'm sure you appreciate, is that we -- Air Products is not in a cost-cutting mode that we were in 2014 and 2015. We are in a growth mode. That means that we are hiring people and all of that in order to support our growth. Therefore, in the short term, our costs are going to be higher. And then once all of these big plants come on stream, then the cost relative to the margins and so on will come down. So we are -- we are not a company where we are in the mode of cutting costs and all of that. 
 We also made a conscious decision, which is different from a lot of people, but I feel very strongly about it, that under the COVID conditions then all of our people are under a lot of stress, worrying about the health and safety of their families that I didn't want to cut their salaries or lay them off. That was a conscious decision on our part. We could have cut their salaries, like a lot of other people did. We could have made a lot of people off, but we decided not to do that. Obviously, the consequence of that is that our margins go down. But we felt that it is better to take a hit on our margins, but at the same time, demonstrate to our people that we are with them for the long term. We are not operating the company based on trying to be heroes and announce a result this quarter. We are building the company for the next 30 years. Our people have sacrificed. They have -- got up every morning in the middle of COVID going to running our facilities, and I just wanted to be absolutely supportive of them. That means that we take a hit, as you have seen. But I think that is well justified. And that is our policy. And that is what we will do as we go forward. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. 
Steve Byrne: Yes. Seifi, when you look back at this last fiscal year relative to what your expectations were a year ago, obviously, you had the COVID impact of $0.60 to $0.65. Jazan has been delayed and, therefore, not contributed to the fiscal year. I'm curious, what else would you highlight as being meaningfully different than what you were expecting for the fiscal year? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Steve, you're asking an excellent question. We had given a guidance of about $9.35 for the year. If you take Jazan contribution out, and you know that was about $0.50; if you take the COVID contribution out, which is about $0.60, we delivered $8.38. So we basically delivered what we had kind of committed to. So other than those 2, there was no surprises. There was no -- nothing unusual that we -- I want to highlight. I think we got the pricing. We got the -- our plants running. We didn't shut down any facility, and there wasn't anything unusual. That is why, Steve, I'm not giving guidance. But I don't want that to be interpreted that we are in any day, shape or form concerned about the performance of Air Products. 
 Obviously, COVID-19 will have its impact. We might have to go into another lockdown and all of that. But fundamentally, Air Products is doing great. We have a great bunch of people. They are motivated. They have demonstrated. Please remember, we kept all of our 750 plants operating during the COVID, even at the height of the crisis, even today, and served our customers. So I feel very good about the company, and I feel very confident about the future. 
Steve Byrne: And following your announcement of NEOM, the news flow on green hydrogen has certainly surged and in particular, quite a bit recently on green ammonia, either out of Australia or CF Industries. But I would say they're kind of targeting different end markets than you have highlighted for NEOM. And I was just curious whether any of that might have led to any change in your dialogue with potential customers with respect to the green ammonia coming out of NEOM longer term. And any expectations on your part on when you might be able to line up some contracts for that project? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, thank you for the question. We are getting more and more optimistic and more and more excited about the whole green hydrogen and green ammonia project. But at the same time, there is a lot of emphasis on hydrogen in general, blue hydrogen and green hydrogen. We are the largest producer of ordinary hydrogen, which comes from hydrocarbons. I call that gray hydrogen. We are the largest producer. And as people need that, we will provide that. There is significant interest in so-called blue hydrogen or blue -- I mean ammonia and hydrogen go together because ammonia is a way of transporting hydrogen around the world. But blue ammonia is becoming very popular for countries and places where they only care about the CO2 emission. They say that, look, you can make me ammonia in Indonesia, burn coal, do whatever you want. But if you capture the CO2, and I can certify that the ammonia that I'm using doesn't have -- the CO2 has been collected is blue ammonia, then I can use it and get the credit for not putting CO2 in the air, which they are right. So that is what is called blue ammonia. 
 And then the -- I mean that is the middle one. And then the ultimate one is obviously green ammonia that we are going to produce in plant. So to me, it's like unleaded gasoline, which is gray hydrogen; ordinary gasoline, which is blue ammonia; and then premium, which is equivalent to green hydrogen. 
 We play in all of these sectors. NEOM is focused on green hydrogen. But we do have projects that you are working on blue ammonia, on blue hydrogen and obviously gray hydrogen. So the main thing that I think is significantly encouraging is the world is beginning to see what we have been saying for 4 or 5 years that hydrogen in one form or another is going to play -- be the energy of the future. Everybody is now talking about it. I'm very happy about that. But the important thing is that we -- I think we have a lead because we have actual real projects doing these things. But we are very excited about all of those opportunities that you mentioned. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. 
Unknown Analyst: This is [ Andrew Casio ] on for Vincent. Seifi, sorry to [indiscernible] the point, but just wanted to ask on Jazan. So you went from an uncertain time line to -- hoping to finish or close everything in October. As you look today, it looks like we're a little bit more of kind of back to uncertainty. So just curious, you talked about the terms and conditions, did something change between when you last talked about this and now that makes it more uncertain beyond just kind of ongoing COVID? Or as you think about the risk profile of the project going forward, did the risk profile change? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Okay. I mean the world is changing every single day. I mean the oil prices go up and down. The financing markets change, people change in different companies and all of that. All I'm saying about Jazan is that I just do not want the investors to have in their model for 2021, whatever it is that they have, $1 a share or something like that, and count on that. All I'm saying is please, to use my exact words, don't count your chickens before -- wait until we announce that we have done this before you put that in your absolute model. 
 That's all I'm saying is that because everything changes every day. I mean look at that. We have a presidential election. There is a possibility we have a new president. There is a possibility we have a new foreign policy. There is a possibility of a lot of different things. Nothing is 100%. My obligation is that every quarter when I'm in front of you to tell you exactly what we know. And what we know right now is that we haven't closed on this acquisition, and I just wanted to make sure you know that. 
Unknown Analyst: Understood. And then maybe just back to the quarter and the business. As we think about 4Q, could you just give us a sense for what merchant volumes were versus kind of your broader business by region? And as we look at the trends that you mentioned and highlighted thus far in 1Q, could you talk about the different end markets as well, and what you're seeing there? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, on that one, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned something, I'll repeat that for you that as of today, the 11th of November, the way we see our business is that our Asia volumes are back to where they were in 2019. Asia, especially China, there is no COVID issue. It has recovered, and our business is doing fine there. So that's what we said. 
 In Europe, unfortunately, there is a significant surge, as you know, very well in COVID-19. That is creating a situation when governments are putting restrictions. Some of them are actually doing lockdowns and all of that. Therefore, our volumes, as of today, there is 5% to 10% lower than last year, especially significantly lower in our packaged gases business, which is very logical and expandable because that is the most susceptible to economic activity. In the United States, again, as you know, COVID cases have gone up. People are getting a little bit more conservative about the business activity. And our merchant volumes are down 5%. They are not down 10%, like in Europe, mainly because we don't have a packaged gas business in the United States. So that's where we are. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. 
Kevin McCarthy: Seifi, it seems like you have a lot going on in the LNG arena. You referenced -- I think you used the word massive to describe the Qatar project and then Mozambique, Algeria and the U.S. Can you give us a sense for 2 things: the capital required for these projects? And what the earnings tailwinds could be from them in fiscal 2021? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much, Kevin. Thanks for the question. Kevin, we are very optimistic about our LNG business. Obviously, we have picked up a lot of quarters, and we think that the outlook for this business is very positive. You obviously know better than I do that this business is cyclical. Right now, we think we are on the up cycle. Obviously, for the last 3, 4 years, we were on the down cycle. 
 In terms of the capital, the great thing about these projects is that the return on capital is infinite. Because we don't put any of our capital, we get paid for what we are doing. It's sale of equipment. So whatever the money that we make is return on capital employed of the plant and the facilities that we have that we don't sell the new plant, then we get a new order. So the return on capital on these projects are very, very, very high. 
Kevin McCarthy: And then as a second question, I wanted to ask about the sequential margin pattern, EBITDA margin pattern in the Americas in the fourth quarter versus the third that was down 340 basis points. I think in prepared remarks, you indicated there was increased maintenance activity. Did that explain all of the change there? Were there other factors? In particular, I'm wondering if the hydrogen business affected the percentage margin? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Kevin, you are very right about the main effect being the maintenance cost. The maintenance cost is driven -- we don't have control of that. I mean we have control of the cost of the maintenance. But we don't have the control over when that happens. Because that can only happen during the time that the customer decides to shut down their refineries. Obviously, a lot of the refineries, considering what was going on with the market, they decided to take their shutdown during the summer when there was not a lot of -- I mean you know the situation in the marketplace for refineries. So that is what we got the hit. But are there other hits? Please don't forget that when we report Americas, did we grow South America, obviously, South America is not doing very well. So it was a combination of other factors, but the main factor was the maintenance cost, as you mentioned. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. 
Robert Koort: Seifi, I think you highlighted you're still plugging away at Indonesian opportunities. I guess it was a news blip that maybe Bukit Asam and Pertamina were going to sign a deal with you this month. Can you give us some insight into that? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Bob, you are obviously very up-to-date about the latest thing that comes out from any part of the world, Bob. But the 1 lesson that we have learned from Jazan is that it is better not to say anything until you have the final contract rather than announce something and then have to explain why it is delayed. As a result of that learning from that, I have no comment about what is coming out of Indonesia. Once we have a deal, we will let you know. There is a lot of rumors going on. But I don't want to comment on that one day or another until we actually have anything to announce. And if we have anything to announce, we will announce that. 
Robert Koort: Fair enough. I'm wondering on NEOM, when do you think you might be able to formally announce some offtake agreements for the green hydrogen with truck or bus depot customers? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Never. We don't intend to make any announcement. Sorry to be categorical, Bob. But I'm just making a point, we do not intend to start announcing whom we sign the contract for and so on because we just obviously don't want to tell people where the market is. We are going to be very confidential about that. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. 
P.J. Juvekar: Can you talk a little bit about the health of the refinery customers on the Gulf Coast, given that low [ 2 11 ] margins, the light heavy spreads have come in. What's the outlook for hydrogen volumes into refining? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: So P. J., you and your people and a lot of other people know a lot more about that than me. So I'm not an expert to be able to comment on that. The only thing that I know is that when you look at the U.S. refining capacity of somewhere between, I don't know, 18 million, 19 million barrels a day, you have already had announcements about shutdown of about 800,000 barrels, which is about 4%. Now has there been enough of a demand destruction to justify that? Or is that going to come back and create shortages? Or is more needed? I really don't know. I don't know how to comment on that. But the main thing is that what we have seen up to now hasn't had any material effect on our business. And as we go forward, we do not expect any material effect on our business based on what we know today. 
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the CCS-type projects, carbon capture projects, is that like a stepping stone before we really get into green hydrogen? And do you expect to see more of these carbon capture projects coming on? And what's your experience there, I should say, expertise there? And can you just talk about your position there? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: We think that things will move in parallel. I think people will continue to need gray hydrogen just to clean up the transportation system in the cities, no matter how the hydrogen is produced. Then they will need blue hydrogen, which means that it will drive blue hydrogen and blue ammonia, which will drive a lot of carbon capture opportunities. And obviously, a green hydrogen. So I think all 3 of them will go in parallel. 
 We are playing in all 3 of them. We obviously, as I said, the largest producer of gray hydrogen in the world. We have a lot of projects working on carbon capture, whether it is for production of ammonia or whether it is production of blue hydrogen and all of that. And when the time comes, we will announce them. And we, obviously, are very much involved in production of green hydrogen. So I think there is opportunities for all 3 of these. And quite frankly, you will see projects announced by us and of different people for all of these activities. Because fundamentally, I think there is a massive fundamental change in the public opinion, especially in Europe, even in the U.S., even in China, Korea, Japan, everywhere, a fundamental move that the world is getting warmer. Global warming is not a joke. It is a fact. It is science-based, and we need to do something about that. And as a result, all of these projects will go forward and I think everybody would make announcements and everybody would want play in it because that is the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. 
John Roberts: Seifi, this may not be big, but you acquired a company called ACP in Europe for dry Ice and carbon dioxide. Do you think there are going to be any spikes in that business like we had in helium? Are we facing some shortages with the vaccine distribution? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, John, you're asking me a very good question. I really don't want to opine on that because it depends on the market development and all of that. And I really don't want to make too much comment about our involvement with the vaccine because we have confidentiality agreement with the people that we are working on. 
John Roberts: All right. Secondly, Shell recently announced it's going to close 8 of its refinery sites. And I assume we'll see some other closures. Do you have any refinery hydrogen contracts coming up for renewal in the next couple of years with refineries that might be closing? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, the only one that we know that is closing is -- I mean, we know that Shell Martinez is closing. We had a contract there. And we know that Shell in Convent is closing. Those are the ones that we know. Anything else that might come up, might come up. But these things are not going to be material to Air Products because, quite frankly, we don't make that much money selling hydrogen to Shell anyway. So even if they close, it's not going to rob us out a lot of profit. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. 
Michael Sison: Seifi, can you talk about some of the other drivers for earnings growth in '21? You should have some pricing, cost savings, potentially, you should have other projects, I think, in the hopper. So even if Jazan and Lu'An are delayed, are there other things that help keep EPS on the positive trend? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Mike, that's an excellent question, and you're absolutely right. We see very positive trends in 2021 for Air Products in LNG. I don't really want to comment on pricing because we don't make forward-looking statements about pricing. But you have seen our track record of what we have done. Our merchant pricing in all of the regions was up about 5%, even in the past quarter, even in COVID and all of that. So LNG pricing. And then we do have other projects, other new projects that are going to come on stream. Therefore, as a result of that, as I said, I'm very positive about our results for the next year. It's unfortunate that because of this uncertainty, at this time, we are not able to give you some kind of a guidance. But I hope that by January, we will be able to do that. But we do have a lot of good things going for us. 
Michael Sison: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on Indonesia. Can you maybe remind us why that region or area is attractive for growth -- for capital growth going forward? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Indonesia has made a fundamental decision at the highest level, at the level of their President, that they are going to use coal, their natural resource, to produce chemicals such as methanol or DME in order to reduce their dependence on imported oil and reduce their commitments to foreign currency. Because they have to buy these things, if they make them internally, they don't have to use foreign exchange. They have made that decision. Therefore, as a result of that, I think you are going to see a lot of coal gasification projects in Indonesia. And we hope that with our technology and all of that, we would be a -- play leading role in that. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. 
David Begleiter: Seifi, just on Jazan, what's the time line from here in terms of your negotiations with Aramco and Aramco starting up their portion of the refinery that needs the product from Jazan? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: David, I really don't want to put a time line on this thing because I don't know. I mean it can be a month from now. It can be 4 months from now. It can be 6 months from now. I don't know. I think we we will -- it would not be appropriate for us to put a time line on this thing. But everybody knows exactly where we are and what we are doing. So I just wanted to be very open about that. 
David Begleiter: And just on Lu'An, first, when did you get -- last get paid by the customer? And when will -- why is the customer not operating yet given end market demand in China appears to be doing fairly well as we speak? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, the cost -- we took the shutdown, the plant is shut down. We are starting up some of the different parts of the plant to keep the plant generate a steam and all of that to make sure that things don't freeze and those kind of things to keep the plant that there stays that it can be restarted. The customer -- I mean, right now, the supply/demand situation, with the price of oil and all of that -- I mean, maybe they have decided that right now, they need -- they don't need the product and so on. I'm not into the minds of the customer, and we don't want to force them under another, it's their decision. But I don't want to represent either to you that they have a major structural problem or anything like that. We just feel obligated on these calls. It's our -- we feel responsible to tell you what we know as the time that I'm speaking to you right now. So the situation can change 2 weeks from now or 3 weeks from now. But as of right now, they haven't decided to formally start up the plant. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. 
Jonas Oxgaard: I was hoping to take 1 more stab at Jazan, if you don't mind. But between which parties is the sticking point here? You and Aramco? Or the JV partners? The banks? Like who is the negotiation really held up by? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, I wouldn't want to say held up. It is taking a long time. But at the end of the day, we have 3 different parties. It's Saudi Aramco, for sure, obviously, because they are the customer. But in a funny way, it is interesting because Saudi Aramco is also a partner with us in the joint venture we have put together to do the acquisition. So as you know, the structure of the joint venture that is going to do the acquisition is Air Products, with the majority shareholder, ACWA Power and Saudi Aramco themselves. So that is the joint venture that is negotiating with Saudi Aramco about the acquisition. 
 The acquisition is, as I said, $12 billion. Exactly what is included, what is not included, what the returns are, what the terms and conditions of the financing are and so on? Those are all of the complicated issues that need to be finalized. And then you have all of the banks who are committing to supply $7 billion, and they have their term sheets, they have their term conditions, when do they get paid. Who gets paid first? At what time did they get paid? How much of the dividend goes to them? How much of the dividend comes to the joint venture? What is the final interest rate that they want to charge? And how is it related to LIBOR? All of these things takes time. Considering unfortunately the situation that nobody can really physically get together with people and do things in 2 hours that doing the video conference becomes a little bit more of a challenge. That is what is taking time. 
 So at the end of the day, all the parties have to agree. I mean even if we finalize everything and everything and everything with Saudi Aramco, which is not done yet, but even if you do it, then we have to deal with the banks and finalize everything with the banks in terms of their requirement. And their requirement and so on, obviously, changes. Now what is the view of the banks based on the recent election in the U.S.? What did they see? How do they see the future? These are all of the complications in a deal like this. It's just like any other major acquisition. 
Jonas Oxgaard: Very interesting. And a different question, if you don't mind. Both your big competitors are talking about biogas into green hydrogen. Now if I remember correctly, you guys built a biogas hydrogen facility in Japan, like 5 years ago, 3 years ago. Did you learn something from that project? And is there a reason that you're not talking about biogas today? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: My friend, we are talking about -- we will have no problem. We are actually doing some projects in Europe related to hydrogen involving biogas. We don't have anything against it. But it is quite honestly ridiculous for anybody to assume that bio -- there will be enough biogas to power 200,000 trucks around the world. That is there -- I mean we are involved on those projects, but those are biogas at a specific location for making 2 tons a day of hydrogen. We have those plants. We continue to have that. I have no issue with that. But for anybody to claim that they can build the plant, produce 600 tons a day of hydrogen based on biogas, that is -- that would be a joke. And I'll be [indiscernible] to do this in a bigger scale. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse. 
Christopher Parkinson: Great. So Seifi, you mentioned a few opportunities in Indonesia, which we've seen. It seems like there are also some opportunities in India that despite being in the COVID world are still likely moving forward. Can you just kind of hone in on whether or not these would also be upfront opportunity as well? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Chris. Chris, we definitely see opportunities in India. India has been very much on the record with the Prime Minister talking about coal gasification. And right now, actually, India does have a request for quotation for a very giant coal gasification project in India. And obviously, we are participating on that. We expect India to do coal gasification, significant amount of coal gasification in the future. And we will definitely participate on that. Whether we win it or not, we'll see, but we think that India will definitely do coal gasification because they are at the same place like Indonesia. They are seeing China right now, where China is converting 280 million tons a year of coal into chemicals. And as a result, that has given them significant opportunity to massively reduce their dependence on oil. And I think countries like Indonesia and India see that. Their leaders are very much committed to that. It's just a matter of these things becoming reality through their systems. 
 But yes, we do see opportunities in India. And as I said, it is a live project, a very big project, probably about $3 billion of investment that is being publicly bid, and we are participating in the bidding process. 
Christopher Parkinson: Great. And just as a quick follow-up. Just a lot of us have obviously been talking about [indiscernible]  for mobility and just obviously trying to identify some potential key markets in Europe. But just a quick question for you. Do you believe investors are also underappreciating the ammonia/blue ammonia opportunities in Northeast Asia? And if so, why? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, I think that I don't -- investors are very smart and they will catch up with everything. I think the reason is that people haven't been paying a lot of attention to some of the details going on. Japan has been talking about ammonia as a source of their hydrogen for many years. They had authorized their trading companies to go and look for that. But they specifically -- Japan specifically, is very much focused on blue ammonia because they want -- they are not so much concerned about getting -- being free of hydrocarbons. They want to have -- use hydrogen or ammonia where the CO2, which is produced by making ammonia is captured because they are focused in meeting their requirement for the Paris Accord for CO2 reduction. So they are focused on what is called blue ammonia. And the reason they're focused on ammonia is that their intention, at least for now, I think it will change, but right now, their big plan is, I'm going to buy ammonia. It will be blue ammonia. Therefore, the CO2 is captured. And then I take that ammonia and inject it into my power plants, plus burn the ammonia in the power plants. And as a result, I'm going to be producing electricity, which is carbon-free. It doesn't put any CO2 in the air because the ammonia, which was produced, didn't -- its CO2 was captured. And therefore -- and then I would use the electricity, which is produced to drive my cars and so on. That is their intention right now. I think they will come to the conclusion that, that is not enough because what are you going to do about your buses and trucks because they cannot run on electricity. So at some point in time, they will need clean hydrogen anyway. But I think right now, that is what they are very much focused on. 
 And then the other thing that they are focused on is that, okay, I can take the ammonia and burn it, generate the electricity. And then I will heat up all of my buildings and all of that with electricity. And I claim that, that electricity is CO2 free. But that is their focus. That's why there is so much discussion about blue ammonia for Japan. And we are obviously very well aware of it. We have been aware of it for 4 or 5 years, and we are looking -- working on projects to supply that. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. 
Michael Harrison: A quick one on the impact that you saw from hurricane. Can you maybe strip out what impact you saw there, separate from the maintenance outages? Just wondering if you had an impact from power outages in that Lake Charles area. And any other impacts on your Gulf Coast pipeline network? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Mike, there was an impact, but it is not material. I mean it's in the order of $4 million or $5 million of impact not $40 million or $50 million. So that's why we didn't talk about. But there was an impact. Unfortunately, there has been 3 of them, which have hit the same area. Our West Lake plant was out for a while, but the impact on our bottom line is not that significant. 
Michael Harrison: All right. And then in the past, during times when steel mill utilization rates have been low or when some of those mills are taking downtime, it has impacted your ability to produce merchant Argon. Can you talk about what you're seeing in Argon supply and demand and whether you're seeing elevated costs to move some of that bar around? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Nothing material, Mike, on that. 
Operator: And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. 
Laurence Alexander: Sorry, just a very quick one then. In the core onsite business, do you have any regions or any end markets where bidding activity is improving? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Let me just make sure I understand. When you say bidding improving, that means that there are more people asking for bids and all of that? 
Laurence Alexander: Exactly. In the core, like what people think of as the traditional industrial gas businesses? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Yes. I would like to point out the 2 areas. One is obviously in electronics. We are seeing a lot of activity there. There's a lot of people talking about building new fabs, both in the U.S. and in China and in other parts of the world. And then the second one is obviously a lot of inquiries about green hydrogen, blue hydrogen and blue ammonia and all of that. Those are the 2 significant areas. 
 Well, thank you very much. And with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call today. We very much appreciate your interest. Please stay safe. Stay healthy. And we look forward to talking to you next -- for our results next quarter. Thank you for taking the time. All the best. 
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-07-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products & Chemicals’ Third Quarter Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that the presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Leanne. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at Air Products.com. This discussion contains Forward-Looking Statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide number 2. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and ROCE both on a companywide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and return on capital employed. Reconciliations can be found on our website in the Relevant Earnings Release section. Now, I'm please to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Simon, and good morning everyone. As always, we thank you for taking time from your busiest schedule to be on our call today. Before we talk about our result this quarter, please turn to Slide number 3. As I said last quarter, the true character and leadership of individuals and companies are revealed during times of crisis and unfortunately this crisis continues at different levels in different phases around the world. Our number one priority has been and will continue to be the safety and wellbeing of our people. We have provided all the necessary protective equipment and instituted protocols focused on the safety and health of our people. I want to thank our employees for following these procedures and working hard to serve our customers under challenging conditions. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, to ensure the peace of mind during this time of highest stress with COVID-19 we have not reduced the staff nor cut anybody's salaries. Our people are doing a great job in keeping all of our 750 plants running around the world. All of our corporate or business functions are running smoothly. We continue to gain mega projects around the world and serve our customers and deliver good results despite the significant crisis facing our world. Our robust business model is proving its resilience globally. Our onsite business remains stable. In addition, we have maintained our focus on pricing discipline, despite the lower volumes and as you can see, our merchant businesses delivered improved pricing in all of our regions. Our business model supports and enables our strong financial position and we successfully access the debt markets in April to ensure we are ready for our exciting growth opportunities wish there are plenty of. We continue to execute on our growth opportunities, including the $7 billion carbon fee hydrogen projects we announced earlier in July, and the $2 billion coal to methanol projects in Indonesia. We remain confident and optimistic that we can successfully deploy our very strong balance sheet and ongoing cash flow to create significant value for our shareholders. As Scott will explain in more detail later, we set a goal for ourselves in 2018 to commit to seeing billion of growth projects by end of 2022. We are actually two and a half years ahead of schedule and our job now, we are already committed almost $16 billion. A great job by our business development teams around the world. And while we are proud of succeeding or exceeding our goal we still have substantial capacity and projects for additional projects to continue our growth path. Please now turn to Slide number 4. I'm pleased that our team stay focused on working safely throughout these challenging operating conditions. Look at the Slide number 5, which is the goal we set for ourselves in 2014. I’m proud to say that today Air Products is the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. The Slide number 6 . We have showed you many times before, and we continue to believe in our management philosophy that cash is king and that prudent capital allocation is one of the most important jobs of any CEO. Slide number 7 lays out a five point strategy moving forward with an emphasis on our highest purpose as a company. Now please turn to Slide number 8. Where you can see the exciting, innovative carbon free hydrogen projects, we announced a few weeks ago. This is a unique world-class project to produce carbon free hydrogen - zero footprint carbon hydrogen of the global markets. Air Products, NEOM and Aqua Power we will invest our $5 billion to produce green ammonia from wind and solar power in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. Air Products can take all the green ammonia and invest an additional $2 billion to develop the infrastructures to convert the ammonia to carbon free hydrogen and deliver it to bus and truck peoples around the world. Therefore, Air Products overall investments in the total project will be about 3.7 billion and we expect the financial returns to exceed our previous commitments. This project is a true game changer for the carbon free hydrogen market. As we have always said, we expect to grow significantly in the next decade and we are positioning Air Products to continue to be the leader in the hydrogen to space. On the Slide number 9, you can see another great project our $2 billion in investment in Indonesia to gasify coal to methanol. Air Products will take coal from Bakrie and Ithaca and provide methanol under a long-term onsite business model. Once again, this demonstrates the expansion of our onsite business model, enabling us to offer customers a bonus start and complete solution, providing the products they need from the feedstock that they have. The fundamental drivers of this project are the national security and energy independence policies of the government of Indonesia. And we expect to do more projects like this in Indonesia. Please turn is Slide number 10, our gasification Strategy. All the projects you see here continue to move forward. There are fundamental drivers creating significant growth opportunities in gasification. Countries and large companies around the world continue to focus on gasification to utilize the abundant natural resources they have to produce chemicals as potential fuels and energy in a sustainable manner. We continue to make progress on our important $12 billion Jazan gasification project for Saudi Aramco. Despite the current challenging times, I’m very happy to report today that we have now launched a $7 billion financing required for this project. And we expect to close the transaction in October of 2020. Scott, will have some more to say about this thing in his portion. As I'm sure the investors and analysts will notice, we had remove YK project from our project list and our backlog. This was a large coal gasification project in China. We have already told investments over the past two years that we will only do this project if we can get four more allocations of coal reserves dedicated entirely to this specific project. We have now come to the conclusion that this might not happen in the near future. It might happen later, but it is not happening in the near future. And as a result, we are removing this project from our backlog. If we ever get the allocation then we can add it to our backlog, but right now it is not appropriate to count on it. Now please to Slide number 11. Thanks to the hard work of our team and the strength of our business model, our EBITDA margins remain over 40% which is up 1700 basis points from early 2014. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to provide the financial overview. Scott.
Scott Crocco: Thank you Seifi. As Seifi stated earlier our Company's financial position is very strong. Our cash flow generation is very stable, supported by our industry leading on-site business, which represents more than half of our sales. We were able to complete a highly successful $5 billion debt offering, which was enthusiasm received by investors and enables us to deploy significant capital into high return projects. Please turn to Slide 12, where you can see a summary of our April issuance of $3.8 billion and €1 billion of fixed rate debt, raising about $5 billion of cash in total. We are committed to manage our debt balance to maintain our target A/A2 rating while continuing to pursue our capital deployment strategy. We plan to use this cash to repay about $1 billion of debt maturing between now and the end of 2021 and the fund the Jazan project as well as our other exciting growth project opportunities. We have now several strategic investments this quarter. And we firmly believe that investing in high return projects will create more shareholder value than shared by backs. We are committed to rewarding our investors by increasing the dividend and growing the Company by deploying capital. As shown in Slide 13, Air Products since delivered 38 consecutive years of dividend increase through many periods of challenging economic conditions. Now, please turn to Slide 14 for a summary of our third quarter results. Our teams around the world have worked very hard managing through this crisis. We are encouraged to see that our businesses have been resilient under these challenging conditions. I would like to thank our team for their focus on health, safety and serving our customers reliably. A job very well done. Despite the unprecedented disruption caused by COVID-19, our adjusted EBITDA of $880 million closely matched prior year and last quarter, supported by the stability of our businesses, and the positive actions taken during this time including price increases, cost management, LNG project execution and acquisitions. We delivered price improvement in all three regions. Overall price was up 2% the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price increase and also increased 1% sequentially. For the quarter, higher price nearly offset lower volume. The 7% decline in sales was mainly the result of 4% lower energy pass through, and 2% unfavorable currencies primarily the Chinese RMB, the Chilean Peso, Korean Won, and the Euro. Volume was unfavorable 3%as new plants, increased LNG activities and acquired assets only partially offset the negative impact due to COVID-19 and the volume impacts from planned maintenance outages. COVID-19 reduced overall sales by about 9% and lowered merchant volume about 14% primarily in Americas and Europe. EBITDA margin reached 42.7%, the fifth consecutive quarter, exceeding 40% and up 260 basis points compared to prior years and 240 basis points higher than last quarter. About 140 basis points of the improvement versus prior year was from lower energy pass through, with the rest primarily driven by higher price and lower costs. COVID-19 negatively impacted EPS by about $0.35 to $0.40. EPS is down 7% despite consistent either due to higher depreciation on new plants, including the PBF hydrogen plants, additional interest expense from the new debt issuance and higher tax rates. ROCE of 12.4% is down 30 basis points from prior year negatively impacted by about 80 basis points from the step up in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt. Now please turn the Slide 15. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $2.01 was down $0.16 per share or 7% despite the negative $0.35 to $0.40 impact from COVID-19. Volume, price and costs together were down by a minus $0.05, despite the negative COVID-19 impact. Costs contributed $0.04, primarily due to lower travel and reduced maintenance activities. We are pleased with the overall positive cost this quarter, even as we continue to invest in resources for future growth. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.05 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB, Chilean Peso, Korean Won and the Euro. Equity affiliate income was down $0.02 due to COVID-19. The effective tax rate was 19.3% for the quarter, up 70 basis points over last year and had a negative $0.02 impact. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 20% to 21% in fiscal year 2020. The additional $0.02 reduction in other is primarily due to the higher interest expense associated with the additional $5 billion of debt, partially offset by lower pension costs. Now please turn to Slide 16. We continue to generate strong operational cash flow. As I mentioned, our EBITDA has held firm despite COVID-19 global pandemic, again demonstrating the quality of our business model. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.7 billion or about $12 per share of distributable cash flow. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost 40% or over $1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.6 billion available for high return industrial gas [investments] (Ph). This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. Now, please turn to Slide 17. As I'm sure, you will all remember, in 2018, we said, we saw significant potential for high value creating capital deployment. In fact, we communicated a five year target of committing $15 billion of new investments by the end of 2022. I’m pleased to say that today, after less than three years, we have already been able to commit nearly $16 billion exceeding our original goal more than two years ahead of schedule. We certainly took a significant step up this quarter, despite removing Yankuang driven by the large Saudi Arabia and Indonesia project. Slide number 18 provides additional details on the significant progress we made on our capital deployment this quarter. As you can see, we expect almost $18 billion of investments capacity available over the five year period from FY2018 through FY2022. Our total capacity is expected to continue to grow as we increase EBITDA. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today. Almost $4 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY2022. And almost $5 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. As Seifi said, we continue to sign new projects. So our total project and M&A commitments has significantly increased to about $12.5 billion with about $11 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent almost 30% and already committed about 90% of our total available capacity. But to be clear, we still have plenty of capacity available to deploy in high return projects. And some of this commitment spending will occur after 2022. And our capacity will continue to increase if EBITDA increases. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Scott. I’m very pleased to say that our teams have done an exceptional job proactively responding to the current crisis. All three regions delivered strong pricing results and higher EBITDA margins this quarter. In addition, our costs are under control and we also brought new projects from the stream and acquired assets which have added to our results. Now please turn to Slide number 19. Our Asia results. Our volumes in the third quarter were down mainly due to some negative impacts from COVID-19 and planned maintenance shutdown in two of our large facilities in China. Our team in Asia has a stayed totally focused and discipline on pricing, like the rest of regions. Our merchant pricing and decision was up 4% in the quarter versus prior year. I would like to emphasize that this is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in this region. Our EBITDA for the region was down 2% versus prior year primary due to unfavorable trends. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 50% was up 100 basis points over prior year driven by pricing and favorable costs. Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to discuss America's results.
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 20 for a review of our America's results. America's strong pricing trend continued up 2% versus last year. This is the 8th consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. Price was better across most major product lines. Sequentially, price was up but rounded to zero. COVID-19 negatively impacted sales by approximately 8%, while lower energy pass through and unfavorable currency reduced sales by another 6% and 2% respectively. Overall volumes were down 5% as the effect of COVID-19 which reduced merchant volumes by 50% was partially offset by other growth, including the PBF of hydrogen plant asset acquisition. As expected, the onsite business, which accounts for about two thirds of the region's sales remain stable. The merchant volumes in June did show some modest improvement. EBITDA of $411 million was flat compared to last year as the impact of lower volumes was offset by better price, productivity and lower plant maintenance activities, some of which were delayed into the fourth quarter. EBITDA margin approached 50%, up 550 basis points with energy pass through contributing about half of this increase. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Now please turn to Slide 21 for review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region results. Our EMEA business continue to deliver strong price despite the challenging COVID-19 related economic conditions in the region. Price increased 3% with improvement across all major products and sub-regions. This is the 10th consecutive quarter of year on year price improvement. Price was also up sequentially but rounded to zero. Volume was down 7% as the adverse effect of COVID-19 and maintenance outages more than offset positive on site business. Merchant volumes are down about 20% with weaker demand from packaged gas customers. For the quarter, COVID-19 lowered sales about 13%. Sales were also negatively impacted by 6% from lower energy pass through and 3% from unfavorable currency. EBITDA of $170 million was down 11% as the weaker volumes and unfavorable currency was only partially offset by strong price. EBITDA margin of nearly 40% improved over 100 basis points as energy pass through contributed about 200 basis points. Similar to the Americas results, we did see some modest recovery in Europe merchant volumes toward the end of the quarter. Now please turn to Slide 22 Global gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses, as well as central industrial gas costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activities, but profit is lower due to higher project development costs as we continue to invest to support future projects. Please turn to Slide 23 corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter driven by LNG project activity, including the Golden Pass and Mozambique LNG projects. Now to provide some additional thoughts on the future, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. I do not need to tell any of you about the current crisis and the significant impact on the world and global economy. We see and read about it every day. The COVID-19 recovery is very mixed around the world with some areas back to normal activity, some slowly recovering and some unfortunately, change significant communities spread and having to implement or reinstate restrictions. We are clearly living in uncertain times and that makes it very difficult to make any reasonable projections for the future. Therefore, we are not providing any guidance for our fourth quarter performance. But I can and tell you about what we are seeing so far, in the month of July. As of today, the July 24th, 52% of our sales that is our onsite business is doing well and we expect this to continue. In Asia, our merchant volumes are at similar level as we saw in October in quarter three. In Europe, our merchant volumes have been improving and are now down about 10% so far in July versus last year. In the Americas, where we see the greatest uncertainty on the future economic recovery our merchant volumes are down about 10% so far in July versus last year. As a reminder, we do not have package gadget business in the United States. However, we do expect higher maintenance costs in the fourth quarter as a number of planned outages by our customers have delayed from quarter three. I would also like to add that our goal - we aren’t concerned about the short-term effects of COVID-19 and its impact on the world economy. We do not see any slowdown on the demand for our growth opportunities, the mega projects around the world, hydrogen for mobility, gasification, carving capture on all of that. Therefore, I continue to remain very optimistic about prospects for future growth for Air Products. Now please turn to the Slide number 24. Now, more than ever, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. Our business model and strong financial position will allow us to continue to execute our strategy to create long-term shareholder value. A top priority is the ongoing growth of our dividend also. We are committed to increasing our dividends as we go forward. The projects in our backlog continue as expected and we continue to win significant projects to create long-term shareholder value. Most importantly, we will continue to protect our people's health and safety and take care of their welfare and their families. Let me end today by thanking 17,000 employees around the world for their dedication and commitment. The work will have drive us forward. We are proud to play a critical role and make a difference to the world during this challenging time and into the future. That is our higher surface at Air Products. All of us at Air Products, we all stand together to make their difference. Now, we are pleased to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question today from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone or good afternoon I guess almost. Just want to understand maybe starting in Europe, the EBITDA percentage decline was a little bit more than in the other regions. Is that just sort of the math of the lower margins in that region versus the other two or was there a mix issue or any incremental color you can provide on that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning Vincent. No, it is just the fact that it is a lower margin than the other parts of the world. I would like to ask, Scott, do you have any additional comments on that but -.
Scott Crocco: No, nothing more. We did have an outage of one facility, but there is nothing of systemic issues or anything like that, just as you mentioned, it is lower margin business overall.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, very good. And just [Technical Difficulty] with a lot of conversation about de-captivation opportunities. And I'm just wondering if that is still something that is front of plate or - the opportunities we all thought were big three months ago maybe have come gone as the financial markets have recovered?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I think those opportunities are still there Vincent. It is just that some of them take a long time for it to happen, but we don't see any slowdown on those. And some of those de-captivations are fundamental strategic decisions by some of our customers of divestment of their non-core business. It is not so much driven by COVID or cash flow issues. I mean, Saudi Aramco doesn't have any cash flow issue, but they do want to get rid of some of their non-core assets or other companies. So we continue to look at those and if anything happens, obviously we would tell you.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, very good. Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Vincent. Have a nice day.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust.
James Sheehan: Thank you. So you have exceeded your prior goal for capital deployment. Do you think that means that you should be more aggressive with the next target? And when might we see that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well thanks for the kind of comment. I will take it as a positive comment. We have always said that, if you do the math and take the projects that we have announced, calculate the EBITDA for them and then obviously our capacity goes up and so on, you can come up with the fact that if other can invest $30 billion in total. So we are just going to continue doing what we are doing and as I promised you last time, next summer, we will give you another five year plan in terms of what we are going to do for another five year period, now that we have to achieved our goal. But the opportunities are there, they are very significant and we are not running out of capacity and so on. The math that Scott is doing is very appropriate but he is only allowed to use our current last 12 months EBITDA. And I'm sure you have done the math, a lot of the investors have done the math and they will say, you are going spend $30 billion. And I said, yes it is possible. So we continue to be very optimistic. Thank you.
James Sheehan: Now if the U.S. corporate tax rate is raised to 28% after the presidential election, what impact might that have on your effective tax rate or what can you say maybe about any possible earnings impacts you see from changing your tax policy?
Seifi Ghasemi: You are very familiar with the impact it had when the number went down, so you can just reverse that. And you also need to realize that more than 60% of our business almost 70% of our business is outside the United States. And therefore you know the tax rate in the U.S. does affect our results, but it is not as significant as you see that 100% of our business in the U.S. But you have a very clear reference point. I mean, when it was reduced, you saw how much it benefited us. We were very open about that so.
James Sheehan: Thanks, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. I think you made a comment that customer plant maintenance activity is likely to have an impact on your earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter. Can you elaborate on that in terms of the size of the impact? And which regions you are seeing that activity?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Kevin. First of all, that is a comment which we made about Americas. In the U.S. there is some plant. As you know, our maintenance shutdowns are determined by customers. We can't take our plant down in the state. Some of the customers decided that they were going to do that in the U.S. in the fiscal year third quarter. Now they have decided to do it next quarter. So that comment is related to Americas only. And the effect of that is some - they are always very transparent. We do that, but it is not a material effect.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you for that Seifi. And then as a second question. I would be very interested to hear your outlook on China as it relates to potential new projects. Obviously you have taken YK out of the official budget for now. At the macro level, it would seem that tensions are rising between the U.S. and China. What are you seeing on the ground? And how would you assess potential for meaningful new projects in the region over the next year or two?
Seifi Ghasemi: We don't see any significant change. We are a global company. The Chinese look at us as a global company. We have invested more than $10 billion in China since 1988 in the last 32 years that we have been there. Our business is very local. And therefore, at least up to now, the so called tensions between the two countries hasn’t affected us at all. And there are plenty of opportunities that we are pursuing there. And the fact that we took YK out. I have been talking about that for the last two years to the investors that it was just a matter of a coal allocation. And we don't want to do a big project in China if we are not sure of the supply of coal. So don't read into that as if our opportunities in China has reduced or anything like that. Now we are working on projects in China, as are working anybody else in world?
Kevin McCarthy: Good to hear. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. And sir, your line is open. You may have us un-mute.
Stephen Byrne: Sorry about that. So some of the Japanese utilities have been testing ammonia as a feedstock blend for power production. And just want to know if you had a view on the technical feasibility of that concept, say versus hydrogen blend in with natural gas. Could the ammonia actually reduce NOx? And do you see feasibility in delivering ammonia into this end market from your Saudi project as opposed to you know the dissociation requirement to sell hydrogen in for fuel cell recharging stations.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you for your questions. Number one, technically it is feasible, but with respect to us these are very, very clear when we announced the project that we are not in the business of selling ammonia, we are selling carbon free hydrogen. So that it is technically feasible or not, those are not the applications that we are looking at, because we don't think they are as highly value added as others and for mobility. Ammonia for us is just a transport medium to take the hydrogen gas from Saudi Arabia and convert it to something that can be transported. So we are in the business of selling hydrogen, not ammonia whether it is green or blue or anything like that. That is not our business.
Stephen Byrne: Just a follow-up on the Indonesia project, like the Saudi project. There is a component here that is moving downstream into synthetic chemistry and just wanted to hear your comfort level with that or what you due to mitigate that risk of moving into a new unit operations there. And would it be reasonable to assume that you do so, because you are expecting maybe a higher return on that investment?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, we are not getting into the methanol business as you know very well. The only thing that we have added to our scope is building the plans and operating the plan. The product is going to be sold by other people and the variations on that is the responsibility or other people. In terms of the unit operation of methanol, obviously people are running methanol plants all over the world. But we did realize that we did not have that experience directly. And that is why we made the strategic alignment with how they are top so, who is the leader in production of ammonia and methanol and all of that. And therefore, we are using their technology and their help in enabling us to that part of unit operations without any risk.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: I had a question on your green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia. You mentioned that the opportunity is huge and you can keep repeating that project. Then you also have this gray hydrogen, what you call gray hydrogen on the Gulf Coast from natural gas. And then you have the more polluting coal gasification. I guess my question is, if the hydrogen opportunity is so big, then why type of the capital in more polluting coal gasification?
Seifi Ghasemi: P.J., you are asking an excellent question, but it is very much - I don't want to oversimplify it, but it is like when people go buy a car. Some people like to buy Rolls Royce and some people like to buy Bentley and some people like to buy Toyota Camry. Therefore, we are there to serve the market. Some people are going to going to say I don't care about CO2 emissions. I just want a hydrogen, because I'm worried about pollution in my own specific city, therefore give me hydrogen and I don't care how it is made. And some people might say, no, I want blue hydrogen and some people say no, I want carbon free hydrogen. Therefore, we are the largest producer of hydrogen in the world and therefore we feel obligated to have all three options available and sell it to the market. As I said, it is just right. Not everybody wants the same thing and therefore as a result of that, we don't want to kind of walk away from business by saying no we only sell carbon free hydrogen, why not the other things. We are selling hydrogen right now gray hydrogen in California for mobility, and it is very profitable. Why shouldn't you continue doing that if the customers demand that. So that is our philosophy to be able to sell a spectrum of customers. Little bit like - yes you know what I mean.
P.J. Juvekar: Thanks for that color. That is helpful. I had a question for Scott. Scott, can you go over sort of the merchant pricing in the quarter in different regions? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Scott, do you want to answer that?
Scott Crocco: Sure. Absolutely. Let me answer it both in terms of your merchant on the segment as well as what they refer to as so called merchant-on-merchant. So for the company, overall pricing up 2% and you know that is all merchants because there is not really any pricing in onsite business. So let me give you from a total company perspective 2%. And then Americas was 2%, Europe was 3% and Asia was 2%. That is the total price. Let me now put it to you on a merchant-on-merchant basis. The company was - it is roughly twice, both way versus. 4% merchant-on-merchant for the company, 5% for Americas, 4% for EMEA and 4% for Asia. Hopefully that answers your question.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you P.J.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Michael Sison: Hey guys nice quarter. I appreciate some of the insight on the COVID impact on EPS, some of that is cost, some of that is volume. Can you maybe just frame what needs to happen to get all that back in I guess next year? Is it possible to get that back next year just kind of thinking through how to rebuild some of that earnings power?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well the thing is that next week, you know that we have our costs under control, so we are not going to have any issues with costs. Then our onsite business is going well and it will continue going well, then it all becomes the issue of midterm volumes. You know that we are committed to pricing, that is a principle that I have been talking about in every call. We are committed to that and you see that we are delivering 4% price increases during the time that the world is basically shutdown. So, we are committed to that. And the only thing that is where is the volumes and merchant volumes and the merchant volumes as we have always said is directly related to industrial production activity in different regions. So right now, China is almost back to normal. So next year, actually our team will be better than this year, because they are talking about now China growing about 8%, I had a conversation with a very high level person last night that was predicting about 8% growth in China. So I think that would be there. And then you need to kind of figure out, how would Europe come out of this thing? And how would the Americas come out of this? So we are very much at the mercy of that. I mean, if you want to have a rosy picture that there will be a vaccine and everything will be back to normal, which I hope is the case, then we will be doing great next year. Plus the fact that and in addition to that, in terms of growth of our EPS. Please don't forget that if we are able to close to Jazan, which we announced the fact that we are in the market for the financing sometime in October. Then that would give us a significant boost in terms of EPS in 2021. Okay.
Michael Sison: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. You gave us European and Americas merchant for July. You guys have better visibility than we do. Any thoughts on where you think it could go in August or September?
Seifi Ghasemi: I don't know where it will go, because it is just like a little bit the last time we had our results. It was a question of where Americas seems to be on demand, but now we have been the other way. But I don't want to predict that, but honestly right now, I don't see any reason why it should get worse. But who knows? I can't predict that.
Michael Sison: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: First question just on your $15 billion plus of commitment now. It is been a couple, three, four year journey. If you go back to the beginning of that how did it turn out different? You know obviously, you probably had a preconceived notion of what that $15 billion employed would look like. What was different about it, how returns versus what may be you thought originally geographic split versus original and then kind of end markets versus original?
Seifi Ghasemi: The thing that turned out differently, you are asking an excellent question. Number one, the hydrogen for mobility change sooner than I thought. I thought the hydrogen for mobility will be more like 2023, 2024, but fortunately we have been able to put that project together and announced it. Then the other thing is that so called asset buyback ended up to be bigger than we thought. Because, at the time we announced it, I didn’t expect us to do a $12 billion asset buyback from Saudi Aramco the Jazan project. So those are the two main things that was a little bit different than what we thought, which has allowed us to be two and a half years ahead of schedule.
Duffy Fischer: Great, thank you. And then just one follow-up on NEOM project, or maybe two parts to it. One, when do you need to order your long lead time equipment for that project? And two, what infrastructure needs to be put in place by the country, before you are able to start doing what you need to do, whether that is ports or electric power, you know streets? What do we need to see on the ground happen there first before you start to put your capital in?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, in terms of long lead items we are already talking to people. And secondly, in terms of what needs to happen in Saudi Arabia, they just need to give us a piece of land. That is it. We are going to be self-sufficient there, we are going to build everything. We are going to build the power plant, we are going to build larger inside emission plant, we are going to build the roads, we are going to build the port and the whole thing. So we are not dependent on anything specific happening there.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: We will be there in like self sufficient. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Seifi, I think you said that NEOM project will have four gigawatts of power. Do you need four gigawatts of power to supply a 1.2 million tons ammonia plant or can you talk about the point of that amount of power generation?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, you are asking me, first of all so far reserve review. Secondly, you are asking me a question that gets me into confidentiality and all of that with our partners. You obviously do not need four megawatts of power to produce 650 tons a day of spend outage. That is very easy to calculate, you know that every kilogram of hydrogen requires approximately 60 kilowatts that can be calculated and then we save 75%. And that means, you need to multiply by about two just to make sure that you have enough power to run your facilities and then it is not difficult to calculate how much power as you needs or the ammonia plan needs. So, you obviously you do not need the four megawatts. Therefore, that our other plans for the excess that I cannot talk about.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: So the economics of the project are complicated, because there may be other dimensions to it, other than hydrogen production?
Seifi Ghasemi: Which would be accretive to what it is. Anything else is the additive rather than subtract.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you so much. I hope you are well.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.
Jonas Oxgaard: Question on the CapEx, so you mentioned that some of the CapEx in your backlog is going to be spent pretty far into future. So can you give us a little bit more of a cadence of how much cash do you have available to spend over the next two to three years?
Seifi Ghasemi: As of right now, Scott, you are sitting on $6 billion of cash, not a little bit more than that. And we do generate a lot of cash even after paying dividends and you saw these slides. So we have plenty of cash to do all of the projects we have talked about. And still continue to pay dividends and increase the dividend.
Jonas Oxgaard: I guess more wondering about how much room, there is to sign up more projects with near-term cash outlays. Or is what you have now - what should be debt for the next couple years?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, no, no, no. There is plenty of room, because we can always go and issue additional bonds. We have plenty of room, the company right now, our net debt is about this 0.5 EBITDA. So we have a lot of room. I think that is a very important point there to make that we are not constraint for additional growth and you should expect us to continue to announce mega projects as we go forward. We are not just slowing down.
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay. And I'm curious, you put your backlog in the context of your target. Are you going to take up seriously update the target to change the timeframe of it?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, next summer we will do that. Next summer we will give you another five new plans.
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay, thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: So that you have visibility through 2026 or something like that. Thank you.
Jonas Oxgaard: Perfect.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Any other questions?
Operator: And next we will go to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Seifi, can you just further speak about the proposal for your HRS strategy, and then also your technological positioning and just how it varies versus what others are now progressively proposing with their own projects, you know obviously in some cases in a much smaller scale. It is fairly clear that distribution will be integral to anybody's strategy, but from your perspective, what makes ultimately your value chain proposal different other than just the fully green aspects of it?
Seifi Ghasemi: The thing is that what makes us unique is the fact that we have come up with the practical solution that we can actually execute. I mean, people are talking about a lot of different theories, but we have come up with a way of taking green hydrogen and actually converting it to something that can be transported and delivered to a different station in whether it is in Frankfurt or Tokyo or Shanghai. I mean, that is the innovation and based on the fact that hydrogen refueling stations are self sufficient. That means we are not going to require power from the grid which is not clean power. And we are not going to require power from the grid around the compressors, because those compressors use a lot of power. In order to put hydrogen into a truck, you need to raise the pressure to about 10,000 pounds per square inch that because a lot of compression, so if somebody says I'm going to connect to the grid, first of all that requires a lot of voltage and a lot of electricity. And secondly, that grid - how is the power produced from that grid. So what we have come up with is a unique thing that we just don't touch anything related to carbon, produce the hydrogen and put it in somebody's truck. Some people put another value on that. As I said before, answer to another question, some people might say, no, I don't care how you make the hydrogen. I just want you to make it somewhere else. And then I want to convert the buses in my city to hydrogen because then there is no pollution in my city, but the fact that the word is getting warmer that is somebody else's problem. But the uniqueness of the new project is that we have come up with something practical that four years from now you can actually deliver hydrogen, carbon free to a truck wherever it is. It is not the theory, it is a practical way of doing.
Christopher Parkinson: Alright. Thank you. And then just, second question just there has also been a lot of chatter about carbon capture and people thought as a long way off, but then again, everybody talked about hydrogen as well. If we just look at - we know you have proven technology. So we know there is a demand spectrum that is evolving in the state of California, which could arguably apply to PBS and then also a few different areas which are already been explored in northwest Europe. Just how should we think about these opportunities in terms of your own technology competitive positioning and is there enthusiasm up or down versus even just a few months ago. Just appears there is clearly something here as well.
Seifi Ghasemi: We are very, very enthusiastic about carbon capture. We have a lot of projects in development. And when the time comes, we will announce them. We are very excited about that, because that is another significant solution. Because if you can capture carbon and kind of create, you can create blue editing. You can capture carbon, you can make blue methanol, you can make it blue urea. I mean carbon capture is a very, very essential part of everything. Because no matter how many NEOMs we do. The world has 1.4 billion cars running around. So carbon capture and hydrocarbons are still going to be used. And if you can find a way of capturing of CO2, that can be a huge business. We have always said that. And we continue to work on that and develop the project for that. And I think in the next two or three years, you will hear about us coming out with real commercial proposals on that.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Hope you are well.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Seifi just on to Jazan, assuming it closes in October. How should we think about the earnings ramp up in fiscal 2021 from Jazan?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well Jazan when it comes on it is going - I mean if we close it closed and then we get our VFC. And we have given you some guidance, you know how much capital we are employing, you know the kind of rule of thumb of $0.10 of operating income per dollar of investments? And then you can calculate what the effect will be.
David Begleiter: Very good. One of your competitors has announced a couple of MoUs with respect to China and hydrogen in the last week or so. What is your strategy? And should there be multiple players and whether is it for hydrogen in China going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well the thing is, I don't want to make any comments about what our competitors are doing. I mean they should answer that about what is the difference between an MoU and a signed contracts and what is aspirational projects and real projects. But that is up to them. I don't have any comments about that. But in terms of our prospects, in China we are working on many, many, many, many opportunities in terms of supplying hydrogen. We are building hydrogen fueling stations there. Most of them are so called the gray hydrogen. But that is what they want. In China they are not yet too enthusiastic about green hydrogen. They seem to be happy. They are more focused on carbon capture and so called blue hydrogen. But we are there we are working. And as I said, he want to supply the whole spectrum. We actually have a lot of activity in terms of hydrogen fueling stations in China. I think if you are counting we probably are working on 120 projects. But anytime we do something we don't put out the placements.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Thank you. And I will only ask one since we are going on here. I think you said merchant volumes were down 10% in the Americas and in EMEA in July. Were they down about 10% in June, as well week plateau in here in terms of the improvement in merchant volumes?
Seifi Ghasemi: Approximately that is a correct statement.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: How are you doing John by the way. Doing okay?
John Roberts: Very good, thank you. and you sound well also. So thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. thank you sir, I appreciate that. Any other questions out there?
Operator: Yes. Our next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort: I appreciate your patience, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Absolutely. We wouldn't have ended the conference call until we got a question from you. I'm sure, it is a difficult one, but I'm getting myself ready for it.
Robert Koort: I want to ask you know on the coal gasification, you guys did a good job of assembling technology. You have the capital available, you have the willingness to do it. When we look at this green hydrogen effort. I mean, I suppose also that your capital availability is an advantage. That sounds like you get some electrolyzers technology that is an advantage. And you certainly shown a willingness to do it. But I would also suspect, there is a long list of others that want to break into this market. So what do you see is your secret sauce? What is your competitive advantage here? Is it the relationships, is it the technology, is that the capital, give us a sense why your product is fit to win here?
Seifi Ghasemi: Bob excellent question. The thing is that, in order to make you bring about a project like NEOM. What you need number one, you need to have a willing partner, who is going to give you access to a location, which has the sun and the [rind] (Ph). That means you need to have access to the government. You need to convince the government. This is not something that you go there and you buy a piece of property and try to do something like that, you need vast quantities of area and you are going to be doing things in very sensitive areas and all that. So that is the first in part and with NEOM I think we were able to do with that, it is very difficult to come up with any state, our faces in the board that might have those kind of capabilities. You need to have a relationship and be able to convince the government to support that is first. The second thing is obviously, the idea of how to do this thing. Now that you have announced it, I guess everybody says, I knew all about it yes we can convert it to ammonia, but I think that was but sold in NEOM project, because we demonstrated to the Saudi Arabian government, which is really NEOM, look we are talking about a practical problem, we are not just talking about okay if you make hydrogen gas and then you are daydreaming about the fact that someday somebody will build a ship to liquefy it and take it to the market, because there is real solution there and then the project. Then the third thing is that we have tied up with the largest and most credible producer of electrolyzers. There is no other company in the world right now. That can match the capacity of this in growth in making this stuff. As you know, we have an exclusive arrangement with them. So that is the second thing. And then the third thing is obviously, the fact that we have been doing hydrogen curing and we have more than 50 patents with respect to actually hydrogen fueling stations and how you put yourself in somebody’s trunk at 10,000 PSI. And therefore, those are the competitive advantages that we have. But the most important thing is being the first starter and that is what we have done. So, it is a little bit by gasification, because right now, any country, believe me, any country or anybody anywhere in the world, and I have examples of this, anybody in the world who is thinking about gasification whether it is a country, whether it is a company, whether it is a chemical giant or a refinery giant, they think the phone and call their products. And that gives you a significant advantage. And we hope to be the same thing with respect to, and over there we have this- extremely took ultimately the same thing get hydration for mobility. And don't underestimate a lot of other people wanted to do NEOM, [indiscernible] the only one.
Robert Koort: That is helpful. And is there meaningful differentiation in technology for electrolyzers? I know you mentioned testing crop and you got the alkaline, is that competitive or are there advantages disadvantage to proton exchange or solid oxide? Or is that a stage gating part of the process here? Or do you think that is not something worth spending a bunch of time with on the outside looking in?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think this is public information, the people who have this technology - has been doing this thing for 60 years they have been doing it for making chlorine and all of that. So their technology is very known and their manufacturing capacity is very well. Obviously [Ziemens] (Ph) is talking about their chem. technology. We did look at that and we decided that just was as a bigger option for us at this stage. Now with that chem. technology developing something later on it might or might not? The other people are small operation research professionals doing things. There is nobody there which is quite honestly credit.
Robert Koort: Got it. Thanks so much Seifi. I appreciate you squeezing me in.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Absolutely Bob anytime and hope all is well with you and your family. Next question is there any?
Operator: Yes. Our next question will come from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global.
Michael Harrison: Generally we think about your merchant business is being more profitable when you have higher utilization rates. Yet, you seem to have deliver really good margin performance here, even though you saw double-digit merchant declines in the Americas and in Europe. So can you provide a little bit of detail or color on what actions you were taking to prevent the merchant declined from having a more pronounced impact on your margins?
Seifi Ghasemi: Pricing my friend, focus on pricing. We are not focused on volumes, we are focused on prices and if we lose market share, we lose market share. That is the philosophy that we announced about two and a half years ago, you know, very well. And we said that look the time has come for us to increase prices on our products, because we haven't increased prices for 10-years. Our costs are going up, we are spending a lot of money on development. Our costs of driving the trucks, our drivers cost more, our operators costs more and all of that. And therefore we have been very focused on pricing. And that is what is driving this thing. And you can see the pricing. I mean, when you look at the history of the industrial gas businesses in the last 10-years, there aren't that many places. But even under normal times, people got 4% price increases every quarter.
Michael Harrison: Alright. And then maybe a question for Scott. Just the contribution of the PBF Energy acquisition in the quarter from a revenue standpoint in Americas.
Seifi Ghasemi: I didn’t take that question because I don't think Scott will answer that question because we don't want to disclose that. But Mike, you can calculate that. We told you it is $530 million. And we keep saying that the minimum thing is $0.10 for every dollar of capital. So you can calculate that very easily. And, our tax rate is about 20%. So you can come to the conclusion and then figure it out that it was in the corner for about a month and a half. And you come up with a number. But we don't want to go through the details of that, because we do not want to exactly talks about the possibility of that project.
Michael Harrison: Understood. I think I was speaking more in terms of the revenue contribution. Just trying to break out what was truly organic versus what was driven by an acquisition.
Seifi Ghasemi: On that one, you can make a good guess my friends. But we cannot go there. Sorry about that. Give us a break at least once in a while. Okay.
Michael Harrison: Understood. Thanks for much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: And our next question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick question then. On the return on capital on projects for the conversion rule of thumb the $0.10 for every dollar of CapEx. That has been sort of an industry benchmark for several decades. If you look at the size of the addressable markets. That you now have access to. Your technology position, your process know how, just everything you are bringing to the table to help make this all possible. When we look at the next wave of projects and not the market creation projects, but the next wave after that. Should we expect the return on capital that Air Products can get to go higher because of technology value and process know how? Or is there anything going on in the industry where the $0.10 is a good rule of thumb for the next decade?
Seifi Ghasemi: We are going to do better than $0.10. you are right, the next phase is going to be more profitable. Yes, thank you.
Laurence Alexander: Okay. Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: And our last question will come from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Hey, Seifi. Thanks for taking my question. So you have a lot of future EBITDA coming on projects that are - won't be really materializing over the next couple of years. It is really more of a 2023 to 2025 kind of timeframe. And it looks like a growing portion of your business is actually going to be tied into joint ventures at least relative to kind of past levels. So I guess with that, should we be thinking about how EBITDA flows through to your cash flows. Similarly, on those joint ventures. Or is there anything that maybe holds back some of that cash? So when we start trying to compound things and look forward, we should maybe be hair cutting it a little bit. How should we be thinking about that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi John, you are asking very, very good question. Can I just make a comment? Not everything is going to come on just during 2023, 2024. We are going to have a lot coming on the stream in 2021, like we close Jazan then in 2022, we have to Jiutai and several other projects that come on stream. So this is going to be a continuous growth. So we don't have a decode some. The other thing about the EBITDA and the joint ventures, obviously it depends and you don't have too many joint ventures, but the joint ventures that we have some of them we can consolidate, some of them we cannot consolidate. And the issue that becomes a very complex calculation and all that. But I don't think, you want to take too much of a haircut on the EBITDA, because we will get most of it.
John McNulty: Got it. Perfect. Thanks for the clarification.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much John, I appreciate that.
Operator: And we currently have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. So, in closing, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for listening to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. As I said earlier, please stay safe and healthy. I'm looking forward to talking to you in three months. All the best. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-04-22 22:45:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals second quarter earnings release call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.
 Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. 
Simon Moore: Thank you, Leanne. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary.
 After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com.
 This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide #2.
 In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, when we refer to earnings per share, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and ROCE, both on a company-wide and segment basis, we are referring to our adjusted non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and return on capital employed. Reconciliations can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section.
 With the significant social and economic challenges the world is currently facing from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have restructured our call today to focus on the key information we believe is most important to our investors. You can find our Q2 segment slides in the backup section, but we won't go through them in detail on the call today.
 Also, given the significant uncertainty that remains regarding the duration of the crisis, the pace of recovery and the negative impact on the global economy, Air Products is not providing Q3 FY '20 EPS guidance. In addition, we believe it is prudent to withdraw our FY '20 EPS and capital expenditure guidance and therefore we advise our investors that such guidance should no longer be relied upon. We are not providing new FY '20 guidance at this time.
 And like all of you, we are conducting this call remotely. So during the Q&A, we will intentionally pause to help with any time delay and avoid 2 people speaking over each other. We appreciate if you would do the same, and we also appreciate your patience.
 Now I'll turn the call over to Seifi. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Particularly during these challenging times, we thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. Before we talk about the quarter, I wanted to share some thoughts on the current situation. Please turn to Slide #3.
 The true character and leadership of individuals and companies is revealed during times of crisis. We are certainly going through a crisis, something that none of us has experienced in our lifetime. But I am delighted to report to you that the people of Air Products are demonstrating our culture and character to the world. They are responding to the crisis with caring for our fellow employees and our fellow citizens around the world. They are responding with passion to keep our plants operating, so that we can provide our customers with the vital products that they need, as they are responding with their commitment and dedication to move Air Products forward, no matter what the challenges.
 We have always been a leader committed to safety as our #1 priority. In managing through this crisis, we have provided the right protective equipment and procedures to protect our people on the front lines. We were quick to act to limit travel and transition many employees to work-from-home mode to minimize risk. We are also committed to providing financial security for our people. During this crisis, we have not laid off any of our employees or cut their salaries. We will work to maintain this approach as we navigate through this crisis together. We have a strong financial position necessary to carry our people and their families through these unusual times.
 Air Products is looking after our customers. Our customers expect us to provide them with the products they need on time with the right quality and a focus on providing excellent service. I am proud that during this crisis we have kept all of our 750 plants operating around the world. I'd like to repeat, we have kept operating all of our 750 plants around the world, significant accomplishment during these times. We provide products, services and equipment essential to basic human needs, including medical oxygen, helium for MRI machines, products for food freezing, hydrogen for energy and related equipment critical to energy and medical needs. We are proud to be identified as a critical industry by all the governments around the world.
 I want to thank our people on the front lines for keeping all our plants running and delivering to our customers the product they need. In addition, the rest of our people working from home have helped us maintain our business continuity by keeping key processes running and continuing to pursue and win new projects like the PBF hydrogen plant's acquisition that we announced in March and closed last week.
 Air Products is also a leader in looking after our communities. I am proud of how our teams have mobilized safely and quickly to meet increasing oxygen demand. We are actively supporting medical facilities and the establishment of critical temporary hospitals. We have also made financial contributions, donated critical PPE and equipment and offered our talents to nonprofit organizations that are meeting so many urgent human needs during this crisis. We are making a difference in people's lives.
 Air Products is also a leader in creating and preserving shareholder value. With a prudent management of cash over the last 6 years, we now have a very strong balance sheet and plenty of cash on hand to weather the current crisis, continue to pay dividends and invest in attractive opportunities.
 I would like to thank our team for their commitment and dedication during these difficult times. Their hard work and our resilient business model allowed us to deliver our 24th, and I'll repeat, our 24th consecutive quarter of year-on-year earnings growth despite the negative impact in the second quarter of about $0.06 to $0.08 of earning per share from COVID-19 virus.
 Now please turn to Slide #4. I am pleased that our team stayed focused on working safely. This is always important and particularly during these challenging times. Now please go to Slide #5, which shows our goal, which remains unchanged.
 And now please go to Slide #6, our management philosophy. We have included this slide in every presentation that I have made to our shareholders in the last 6 years. It is at times like this that one can fully appreciate the value of following this key management philosophy that I have pursued in my 50 years' career. Yes, cash is king. And yes, the most important job of the CEO is prudent capital allocation. We have been focused on generating and preserving cash. We did not waste our cash on frivolous acquisitions or share buybacks. And we saved our cash for a black swan event that we have the cash to take care of our people, to continue to run our business, serve our customers, contribute to the welfare of our communities and create value for our shareholders.
 Now please turn to Slide #7, which is our long-term business strategy. You have seen this many times before. There is no change to this strategy, and we will continue to pursue it as stated.
 On Slide #8, you can see our exciting gasification strategy. The fundamental drivers creating significant growth opportunities in gasification remain. Countries and large companies around the world continue to focus on gasification to utilize the abundant natural resources they have to produce chemicals, transportation fuels and energy in sustainable manner.
 At this point, I think it's appropriate for me to update you on our important $12 billion deal, the Jazan project for Saudi Aramco. Despite the current challenging times, I'm happy to report that we have now completed the discussions regarding the legal documents, and these legal documents are being submitted to the vendor's legal adviser. Therefore, we now expect to go to the market for the $7 billion project financing by the end of May, and we expect to close this transaction by October of 2020.
 Now please go to Slide #1 -- #9, please, which summarizes the PBF hydrogen plant's acquisition we announced a few weeks ago. Despite the unprecedented challenges in the world these days, I'm proud that we continue to win large on-site opportunities. We have closed on the purchase of the 5 operating hydrogen plants in California and Delaware for $530 million and have started providing long-term hydrogen supply to 3 PBF energy refineries. This project will have returns in excess of the minimum requirements we previously shared with you, and it will be accretive to our bottom line this year in 2020.
 I'm proud of our team who have worked diligently to negotiate, sign and close this deal in less than 30 days. This project is aligned with our on-site growth strategy: using our strong balance sheet to acquire, own and operate assets for customers and supply gases under long-term contracts. We are pleased to expand our strong relationship with PBF. In addition, we are working on many other opportunities around the world so that we remain confident in our ability to deploy our available capital to create significant shareholder value.
 Now please turn to Slide #10. Again, with the hard work of our team, and the strength of our business model, our EBITDA margin remained over 40%, which is up over 1,500 basis points from early 2014.
 Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Vice President -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to provide a financial overview. Scott? 
M. Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi stated earlier, our company's financial position is very strong. Our cash flow generation is very stable, supported by our industry-leading on-site business, which represents more than half of our sales. Additionally, our cash on hand and limited debt provide an ability to access additional funding as needed. We are confident that we have sufficient resources to meet all our capital deployment opportunities.
 As you can see in Slide 11, we have over $2 billion of cash on hand. We also have an undrawn $2.3 billion committed revolving credit facility available. However, I don't anticipate any need to access these funds. Meanwhile, our company's leverage is very low. Net debt is about $1 billion, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is a low 0.3x. This allows us to increase debt considerably while still maintaining our targeted A/A2 debt rating. Our dividend and capital investment plans remain unchanged. We are committed to rewarding our investors by increasing the dividend and growing the company.
 As shown in Slide 12, Air Products has delivered 38 consecutive years of dividend increase through many periods of challenging economic conditions, and we continue to believe that investing in high-return projects will create more shareholder value over the long term than buying back shares. We remain optimistic about our ability to deploy significant capital into our exciting growth opportunities, including recent opportunities like the PBF asset acquisitions. We also have about $1 billion of debt maturing by the end of 2021, so we continue to evaluate the best time to access the debt markets.
 Now please turn to Slide 13 for our second quarter results. Our sales and profits grew despite the unprecedented disruption due to COVID-19, demonstrating the stability of our on-site contracts and the geographic diversity of our merchant businesses. Overall, COVID-19 negatively impacted volumes by about 1% and EPS by $0.06 to $0.08, primarily in the Asia merchant business. The Asia merchant business was down about 25% for about 6 weeks after the Lunar New Year holiday but recovered in late March. As expected, our on-site business remained stable. We also did not see much impact in Europe or the Americas for the quarter, but we did begin to see an impact right at the end of the quarter. Seifi will provide some comments later regarding what we have seen so far in April.
 Our team in Asia has worked hard managing through the crisis. We are encouraged to see that business gradually returned to normal by the end of the quarter. I would like to thank our team for their focus on health, safety and serving our customers reliably. A job very well done.
 For the quarter, sales grew modestly to $2.2 billion as strong underlying sales were offset by 5% lower energy pass-through and 2% unfavorable currency, primarily the Chinese RMB, the euro and the Korean won. Volume and price improved in all 3 regions. Volume increased 6% as new plants, overall positive base business, LNG activity, acquisitions and a short-term contract in Asia more than overcame the negative impact of COVID-19. And as I mentioned, our existing on-site business was stable.
 Price was up 2%, the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price increase. EBITDA reached almost $900 million, up 8%, with higher profits across all 3 regions. EBITDA margin was again over 40%, the fourth consecutive quarter exceeding the 40% mark, up 260 basis points. About 180 basis points of the improvement was from lower energy pass-through, with the rest primarily driven by higher price. EPS of $2.04 was up 6% despite the negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of COVID-19 and unfavorable currency. Sequentially, sales and profits were down as a result of reduced activities due to Lunar New Year holidays and the COVID-19 impact. ROCE of 13.5% continues to improve, up 90 basis points over last year.
 As Simon mentioned, we don't plan to review the individual segments in detail, but I would like to make some summary brief comments on their second quarter performance. All 3 geographic regions delivered stronger results, with volume, price, EBITDA and EBITDA margin up in each region. Asia's volume was up 6% despite a negative 4% impact from COVID-19. The growth was driven by new plants and a short-term supply contract that we mentioned last quarter. Almost 2/3 of our Asia business is on-site, which remained stable as we expected.
 We saw strong hydrogen volumes for the refining industry in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada and Rotterdam. Americas and EMEA only began to see impacts from COVID-19 during the last week of the quarter. Americas EBITDA margin was up 540 basis points, with about 350 of that from lower energy pass-through. EMEA EBITDA margin was up 90 basis points, primarily from higher price. We also saw LNG driving profit improvement in our Corporate segment.
 Now please turn to Slide 14. Our second quarter GAAP EPS was $2.21, which includes 2 one-time items: a $34 million gain due to a property sale and a $14 million tax adjustment in India, which, combined, contributed $0.18 of EPS. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.04 was up $0.12 per share or 6% driven by strong operating performance. Volume and price together contributed more than $0.30 despite the negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact from COVID-19.
 Cost was unfavorable $0.17 due to our continued investment in the resources to support our growth strategy, coupled with additional planned maintenance and life extension work needed in our facilities, mainly in North America, as mentioned during our last quarter's call. We do anticipate customers delaying planned outages in the second half of the year.
 Currency and foreign exchange was $0.05 unfavorable primarily due to the Chinese RMB, the euro and the Korean won. Equity affiliate income contributed $0.03, while a modestly higher tax rate subtracted $0.02. The effective tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, up 60 basis points over last year. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 20% to 21% in fiscal year 2020.
 Now please turn to Slide 15. We continue to generate strong operational cash flow. As I mentioned, our EBITDA was up 8% despite the COVID-19 global pandemic, again, demonstrating the quality of our business model. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.7 billion or over $12 per share of distributable cash flow. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost 40% or over $1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.7 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.
 Slide #16 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we expect about $18 billion of investment capacity available over the 5-year period from FY 2018 through FY 2022. Our total capacity is expected to continue to grow as we increase EBITDA. The $18 billion includes about $10 billion of additional debt capacity available today, over $4 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22 and almost $4 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to evaluate the best time to access the debt market.
 As Seifi said, we continue to sign new projects. So our total project and M&A commitments are up to about $9 billion, with about $8 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent over 20% and already committed almost 2/3 of our total available capacity. We remain extremely confident in our ability to deploy this capacity into on-site projects that will create significant long-term shareholder value.
 Please turn to Slide #17 for a summary of our perspective on COVID-19. We are safely keeping our plants running, and we are mobilized to meet our customers' needs, particularly for medical oxygen. Our results this quarter demonstrate the resilience of our business model despite the impact from COVID-19. We have been seeing lower Americas and EMEA merchant volumes in April and expect that to at least impact Q3. We have seen customers delaying planned maintenance activities, and we are monitoring for any potential delays in our projects under construction. Looking forward, we are confident that our strong financial position will support our future investment opportunities.
 Now to provide some additional thoughts in the future, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. We have now seen how Air Products performed during the months of January, February and March of 2020. I would like to add that we did have a good month of March despite the evolving crisis in Europe and Americas. But I am sure our investors want to know what we are seeing as of today in the month of April.
 This is what I can share with you. First of all, as I speak to you now, just about all of our 750 plants around the globe are operating and supplying essential products to our customers. The 52% of our sales, and I'll repeat, 52% of our sales that is our on-site business around the world is doing well, and we expect this to continue.
 In Asia, our merchant volumes have returned to pre-crisis levels, and some product lines are actually higher than last year. In Europe, our merchant volumes are down about 25% in the month of April, although this seems to have improved slightly in the past week. The main impact in our volumes in Europe is in our packaged gases business. In Americas, our merchant volumes are down about 15% in April and seemed to be stable over the last week. Please note that we do not have a packaged gases business in the United States.
 Although it is encouraging to see some improvement in the number of COVID-19 cases and a flattening of the curve in certain areas around the world, but we all need to realize that significant uncertainty still exists regarding the duration of this crisis, the pace of recovery and the negative impact on the global economy. Given this uncertainty, Air Products is not providing fiscal third quarter EPS guidance, and we believe it is prudent to withdraw our prior fiscal year 2020 EPS and CapEx guidance.
 While we are not providing guidance, I would like to remind you of a framework you can use yourself to think about Air Products' business in this complicated time. Together, the stability of our on-site business around the world and the continued normal volumes in Asia represent about 2/3 of our business. And we don't expect much impact on this 2/3 percent of our sales as we move forward during the balance of the year.
 For the other 1/3, which is our merchant business in America and Europe, we do expect an impact in quarter 3 and for the full year. But given the level of uncertainty, we are not in a position to quantify. But one way to think about the potential impact is by assuming that the merchant volumes in these parts of the word align with industrial production. So for example, if both Americas and Europe merchant volumes were to be reduced by 25% for a single quarter because industrial production has dropped by about 25%, this would impact our Air Products earning per share by about 30% to 35% per share, which is 3% to 4% of our annual EPS.
 And finally, please turn to Slide #18. In these challenging times, our competitive advantage as always is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. Our strong financial position and robust business model will allow us to continue to execute our strategy, to create long-term shareholder value and to increase our dividend as we have done for the past more than 30 years. The projects in our backlog continue as expected, and there continues to be significant opportunities to invest in projects in our core business. Most importantly, we will continue to protect our people's health and safety and take care of their welfare and the welfare of their families.
 Let me end today by thanking our 17,000 people again for their commitment and hard work, for demonstrating the true character of Air Products. Our success yesterday, today and tomorrow depends on their dedication and commitment, and I am very proud to say that the Air Products team is demonstrating that to the fullest extent under the most extreme conditions. We are proud -- we are very proud to play a critical role and make a difference to the world during these challenging times by keeping our plants running and providing critically immediate industrial gases to keep people alive. This is our higher purpose at Air Products.
 And to everyone listening today, let us remember that we are all in this crisis together and we will come out of this thing together and we will win together. Stay safe. Stay healthy. And now we will be more than happy to answer any questions that you have. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. 
David Begleiter: Seifi, on Jazan, assuming it closes on October, how should we think about the earnings contribution in 2021? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, obviously, we have given you a guidance about the fact that for every dollar that we invest you should expect approximately $0.10 of operating profit. So you can convert that to EPS impact very easily. At this point, I think that's the guidance I want to give you, but once we actually close, then we will be a little bit more specific. 
David Begleiter: Very good. And just last thing on your on-site business, what's your exposure as refineries reduce their operating rates? You highlighted the stability of your on-site business, but is there not some downside risk as we do see lower crude runs by refineries? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: No. Our on-site business, as we have always said, we get a fixed monthly fee for running our plants and providing product to our customers. Whether they are operating at 100%, 90% or 80% doesn't make much of a difference. And you have seen that fully demonstrated during the second quarter where there was obviously a lot of pressure on everybody around the world and in China and all of that. So that doesn't affect us that much. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. 
John McNulty: So two questions on the backlog. I guess the first would be you have a lot of business coming in on the merchant front that you've listed in your backlog for 2021. I guess, can you give us some color as to your confidence in that demand or that business coming on and what the impact might be in terms of how we should be thinking about the earnings contribution in 2021? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: With all due respect, John, I would like to disagree with you in terms of the fact that most of those investments in our backlog are in merchant. They really are not. Most of them are in our on-site model. So as a result, I don't expect much of an issue with that as they come in. I think they are mostly on-site business with fixed BFCs. 
John McNulty: Got it. Yes. At that part -- I mean I see the big on-site ones. I guess I was curious because you do have 4 projects listed that are merchant. I was curious what the likelihood of those coming on and the impact might be. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: So they did come on and they are very small in terms of the context of the thing, and some of them actually replaces some older plants. So I don't expect that to be material at all, John. 
John McNulty: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then for the second question, the macro obviously is going to be a lot slower in the short term, and that may have some impact on the ability for new projects to get bid upon and things like that. At the same time, you just won the big PBF project or business. I guess I'm wondering how you're thinking about the on-site opportunities out there and if we should be thinking about the project backlog expanding as we kind of go throughout the year or kind of staying level to maybe going down a bit. How should we be thinking about that? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: I think you should be thinking on that part of our business that it's business normal. And actually, the current crisis might actually create opportunities that some of the people who were reluctant to sell some of their kind of industrial gas plants that they own, that they might be thinking about maybe divesting of those and generating some cash. So I actually think that our -- the pace of what we have been doing will continue and maybe actually accelerate. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. 
Kevin McCarthy: Seifi, in listening to your comments, it sounds like your business in Asia is recovering nicely. If that is the case, would you expect earnings to improve sequentially in the fiscal third quarter in Asia relative to what you just posted in the second quarter? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Yes, I do. Our business in Asia is doing fine right now. And as I said in my comments, some of the product lines are actually higher than last year. So I do expect an improvement in our Asia segment next quarter. 
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Seifi... 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Barring -- yes. Go ahead. 
Kevin McCarthy: Sorry to interrupt. As a second question, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the decision to discontinue your capital expenditure guidance as distinct from the earnings guidance. It looks like the year is half done. I imagine a lot of these projects are already underway. Are there particular sources of uncertainty that have emerged now that might call into question the fate of individual projects? Or what is the rationale there? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Kevin, that is driven by just one project, which is Jazan. As I said, we expect that project to close in October. Now if it closes on September 28, the capital expenditure, which is significant, will be in our 2020 numbers. If it closes on October 2, it will be in 2020, '21. That is why we didn't want to -- since we don't know exactly when the project is going to close, that is why we withdrew that guidance so that we don't create an issue of having said something and it becomes a few -- 1 week or 2 weeks back and forth, and it would significantly change that. That investment is not $200 million, it's billions of dollars. So as a result, that is why we wanted to shy away from confirming the capital expenditure, Kevin. That's the only one actually. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. 
Vincent Andrews: First, if you could just clarify, Seifi, at the end of your comments about how April was going and you talked about if merchant volumes were down 25%, was that -- it'd be a 3% to 4% hit to EPS or a $0.34 hit to EPS? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Sure. Number one, what I said is that if the industrial production drops 25%, and as a result of that both Europe and Americas drop 25%. That is not the case as we see. As I said, European volumes, as we see it in April, down 25%, but in the U.S., it's only 15%. But I just wanted to give you some guidance that if both of those things dropped 25% for the quarter, then the impact for the quarter will be about 30% to 35% -- $0.30 to $0.35, which is 3% to 4% of our total EPS approximately for the year. So the effect will be $0.30 to $0.35 for that quarter, assuming that everything goes down 25%. 
Vincent Andrews: Yes. Okay. That's very helpful. And then if I could just ask on the merchant gases side of the equation. There have been some reports in the U.S. and in Europe about shortages of CO2 in the U.S. as a function of corn ethanol plants not having co-product production. Is that something that you're seeing and that the company is going to be able to be a solution provider for that missing CO2? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: What -- just to put it in context, CO2 -- first of all, your statement is absolutely correct. But in terms of Air Products, CO2 is 1% of our sales in the U.S. and 5% of our sales in Europe. Europe doesn't have a problem now. So in the U.S., it is a very, very small part of our business. So it's not going to have any kind of a material impact on our business, and we are not going to be able to do something to help the situation because it's such a small part for us there. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. 
Michael Harrison: Wanted to -- maybe continuing on the question related to CO2 shortages, just talking more broadly about your business, can you talk about any supply chain or logistical issues that you may have encountered as a result of COVID? Any additional costs associated with shortages or availability or needing to move product around at higher cost or in less efficient ways than normal? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Look, related to CO2, as I said, for us, it's such a small business. We haven't seen much of an impact on our business, and we haven't had to do anything significantly unusual. 
Michael Harrison: I mean, more broadly speaking, though, when it comes to LOX/LIN or argon or anything else. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: No. On LOX/LIN, argon and all of that, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our people, they get up in the morning, they go to work, they obviously wear the proper protective equipment, but we have kept all of our plants running, all of our supply chain. And we haven't had any issues of not delivering to a customer or not being able to meet customer demand. So I'm very proud of that. And we have kept our company running, and we have supplied products to all of our customers with no shortages and no disruption. 
Michael Harrison: All right. And then I wanted to also ask about the impact of lower planned maintenance. You mentioned that a couple of times. That's customer maintenance and planned downtime. But what does that mean to you guys in terms of your own maintenance costs? And are these discretionary maintenance projects? Or why is there a decline? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: When we have a plant like a hydrogen plant that is supplying a refinery, we obviously can only take our plant down for maintenance when they take their refinery down. Because if we take our plant for maintenance and refinery is operating, then we will create a disruption for the refinery. So we coordinate our downtimes very, very closely with the refinery. So what we are saying is that some of the refineries might decide to move their maintenance to another quarter, and as a result of that we would not take our plant down. As a result of that, we would not have to do the maintenance and therefore that might be a favorable impact on our bottom line. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. 
Steve Byrne: You're still getting 2% to 3% overall price in each of the regions, which is driven by merchant, or less than half of your revenue. Given that in a couple of the regions now you're seeing a contraction, are any of those merchant customers asking you to renegotiate price or pushing back on that? So just a general question about your outlook for pricing in this slowdown. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Excellent question. Let me just be very specific. You're right, the numbers that we publish is for all of our business. But I can give you, and we have been open about this thing before, in terms of price increases for our merchant business, year-over-year, Americas was up 6%, Europe was up 5% and Asia was up 6%. So those are the facts in terms of the second quarter. Now what is going to happen in the future, we have a policy of not to comment on prices for the future because of the nature of our industry. So -- I'm sure you understand that well why I wouldn't do that because it's not appropriate. But those are the facts in terms of what we have seen up to now. 
Steve Byrne: And Scott, you mentioned that -- about this available capital deployment capacity that's $18 billion. You've committed, I think you said 2/3 of it. That is a 5-year window that is fixed, and you're now halfway through that 5-year window. At what point do you kind of put that on a rolling 5-year forward basis because your future contribution of that is shrinking? And is this lower oil environment doing anything to your outlook for gasification of coal? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Yes. I will answer that question, Steve. You're right, we have committed 2/3. We have another almost 2.5 years to go to commit the other 1/3. In terms of giving you a rolling 5-year, yes, we will do that, but we will not do that now. We will do that probably next year to give you a view for the next 5 years after 2022.
 With respect to the nature of the projects or any slowdown, quite frankly, we don't see any reason for the slowing down of those mega projects that we are very much attached to as a result of the virus thing, at least at this stage. So we continue to remain very optimistic about the robust nature of our fundamental strategy as we go forward in terms of focusing on gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen full mobility. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: So as I understand your products, whether Air Products' on-site volumes grow or they contract, that piece of the business is irrelevant to year-over-year EBITDA changes, excluding currency and acquisition. The real lever is in merchant volumes and merchant prices. So in a world in which merchant volumes really move down, can you flex your cost structure down in order to cushion the effects to Air Products? Or it's difficult to flex your cost structure? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, Jeff, first of all, you understand our business very, very well. Secondly, you're asking an excellent question. My response to that is that if -- the driver for growth of Air Products, which we are committed to 10% a year EPS growth, is not the merchant volumes going up and down, is the investment in new opportunities and new projects coming down the stream. That is what has been driven our business. If you look at our past 5 years, we have the level accumulative average growth rate of 13% on EPS. That is driven -- it was driven some by the cost structure that we took out and made ourselves more efficient. And we are done with that. As we go forward, the main driver is going to be the new projects that we are bringing on stream, and they are going to be significantly accretive. And that is why no matter what happens to our merchant business, I'm still very optimistic that we will be able to grow our EPS 10% a year as we move forward on the long term. 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: In gasification projects in China, people gasify in order to produce ammonia, methanol and fuels. And in the world that we live in today, I don't know if people need more ammonia, methanol and fuels, maybe they do if you want to be more independent than China. So in a world in which oil prices are now, say, within a range of $25 to $40 a barrel, to be conservative, is it the case that those projects in China still make sense? And when you look at your -- say, Lu'An, for example, how is that client faring in a world where energy prices are down sharply? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, Jeff, this is the general discussion we have always had is that these projects are not driven by financials, they're driven by national security. Oil might be $2 -- at $10 or $20. But coal, 3% softwood coal, which is sitting in the ground, is worth 0. So when you take that and convert that to chemicals, it still pays to do that. That is why we believe that these projects will still continue.
 And then the other thing is that in terms of our gasification, please remember, and I know you know this very well that you're not just talking about coal gasification, you're talking about gasification of pet coke. People are not going to be able to burn pet coke. 6% pet coke is not going to be something that people are going to consume. You have to convert that to something else, and the only way to do that is gasification. At the bottom of the barrel in the refinery is 6%, and you cannot sell it to ships because of IMO 2020. Then you have to gasify it.
 So the gasification is not just coal. Right now, the biggest gasification project that we are doing is the [ $2.5 billion ] project in Jazan. That has nothing to do with the coal, it is the gasification of the bottom of the barrel of the refinery. So when we talk about gasification, it's a combination of all of these things. And that's why we continue to remain optimistic, whether oil is $25 or $40 or $60. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. 
John Roberts: European merchant is down 25% in April. How much more than the 25% decline is packaged gas down? And how much less than the 25% decline is bulk liquid down? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Approximately, packaged gases is down about 40% and liquid is down about 16%, approximately. 
John Roberts: And do you have any hydrogen customers operating below their contracted requirements? And do you anticipate any of your hydrogen customer suspending operations temporarily? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: We do not. I mean I'm sure some of our hydrogen customers might be operating below capacity, but we haven't seen a drop in -- we have not seen a drop on hydrogen volumes from our pipeline. But I don't know in the future that might be the case, but it doesn't affect us, as we have discussed before. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. 
Robert Koort: Seifi, you've only talked about maybe doing asset acquisitions, and it seems like some of the JVs include a component of that, but this PBF was the first meaningful one that was solely assets and not a gas supply and rolling in your project work. But what does the pipeline look of other asset acquisition opportunities? And if you were handicapping, would you suggest your next big capital project will be an asset acquisition or a new gasification project? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Probably an asset acquisition. 
Robert Koort: And can you give us an update on YK? Is there any progress there? At some point, will you need to formalize a delay in your expectations of when that project will come on stream? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Yes. The thing is that, unfortunately, as I mentioned, I think, on our January call, we were supposed to have a big meeting on that thing in the month of February in China, but obviously, that didn't happen. The issue with that project has not changed. It's still the issue of coal allocation, and we are going to kind of put a target for ourselves that by the time that we announce our results at the end of October, we would give you a definitive answer about whether that project is a go or no go. We are still optimistic that, that is going to be a real project. But I do promise you that by the end of October we will give you a definite answer on that, rather than just keeping it kind of in suspense. 
Operator: And our next question will come from PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. 
P.J. Juvekar: Seifi, is all your on-site business on facility fees? Or is there some business, maybe some old business, that was stuck at a certain operating rate below which take-or-pay begins to kick in? So I guess what I'm asking is, is there any cyclicality in your on-site business? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: No. No material cyclicality. No, there isn't. As you have seen during 2008, and as we have demonstrated in the last few months, it's a pretty robust business, the way we have it structured, PJ. 
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then when I look at your volume growth, what was the same-store volume growth for Air Products overall? And particularly in Asia, you gave COVID impact, but can you take out the impact of new project start-ups? And so just trying to get the same-store sales. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: It's obviously the growth is related to new projects, but we usually do not quantify that because then we will be giving away too much information. But obviously, during January, February and March, merchant volumes in China were down, just like they are going to be down in this coming quarter in Europe and the U.S. But we did have new projects coming on stream. And as a result, it made up for it. That is what I was saying in answering the other question that the main growth driver for Air Products is all of the work we have done in the past 6 years with new projects that are beginning to come on stream, and you're going to see a lot of that coming on stream in 2021, '22, '23, which would put us in an excellent position. 
P.J. Juvekar: Right. No, I agree. But it was just in times like this it would be helpful. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Crédit Suisse. 
Christopher Parkinson: So just a quick question on the recent PBF deal. It appears it obviously came together fairly quickly. But can you just address on how long you've been -- that you're targeting these assets? And then, also, just how should we think about the long-term optionality or potential optionality in terms of carbon capture in California as well as the potential to leverage your pipeline network? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Chris, first of all, with PBF, we have known these people very well. They are an excellent company, and we have a very good relationship with them. We have been supplying them hydrogen for a long time. So the subject of acquiring their hydrogen plants has been discussed in the last 2 or 3 years. But it became -- we made a specific offer to them -- I can tell you historically, we made a specific offer to them in October. At that time, they didn't want to -- they took their time to take a look at it. And then finally, in March, we made a very -- even more a specific offer, which they were interested in taking a look at it. But their requirement was that if we can do the transaction in a speedy way, which we said we can, and as a result, we did it during the time that we did.
 In terms of the other question that you have with respect to carbon capture opportunities, obviously, in California, there are significant incentives for if you can capture carbon, and obviously we have a lot of steam methane reformers, and now we have even more steam reformers in California that do generate CO2. And therefore, it makes sense for us to take a look at whether we can capture the CO2 from these things and do something with it, whether it is enhanced oil recovery or sequestration or whatever, to capture some of that value. So yes, we are looking at that. 
Christopher Parkinson: And just also, just -- could you just very quickly just hit on just in terms of end markets, do you see any variance in terms of merchant volumes thus far? I understand it's linked to IP, but just any end markets worth highlighting? Just also a quick update possibly on just your health care business and also nonmedical helium demand would be appreciated. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Sure. In terms of the market sectors, obviously, the oxygen demand for hospitals, the demand has gone up. We do not have a huge business on that in the U.S. but we do have a very big business for hospitals in Spain and Italy and in some other parts of Europe. So the demand for oxygen is obviously up because of the situation. Full freezing demand has relatively kept up pretty well. Obviously, the areas where you see reduction in demand is basic industries and especially smaller industries that use for oxy-fuel burners and all of that for all of the manufacturer. And in terms of helium, the helium, most of the helium goes with MRI machines and that hasn't slowed down. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. 
Duffy Fischer: First question is just, can you help break out the decremental margin differential between the European business and the U.S. business just because there you have package, here you don't? So if we're putting different declines in revenue based on IP from those 2 regions, how should we think about either like on an EBITDA percent basis or an EBIT percent basis differential in decremental margins? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: You're asking me to give you a lot more detailed information than we usually give to people. But overall, if you want to do the kind of calculation that you want to do, there isn't a huge amount of difference between the margins. Americas is higher than Europe but it is not as if one is 10%, another one is 40% there. They are not too different, let me put it that way. 
Duffy Fischer: Okay. Fair enough. And then just the last one, in the working capital line this quarter, it seemed like you ate about $200 million more in cash than you have historically in the second quarter. What happened there? And is that something we should think about repeating? Or is that kind of a one-time thing that will end up going away? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, on that one, on that question, I would like to turn it over to Scott, who knows more about it than I do to answer that. Scott, would you like to take that question, please? 
M. Crocco: Sure, happy to. Duffy, first of all, it's not systemic. There's nothing in there related to the COVID-19. What it is, is just some larger -- timing on some larger payments, particularly in our sales equipment business on some of those contracts. So nothing large and not something we expect to continue. 
Seifollah Ghasemi: What Scott is saying is that it has nothing to do with actually physical inventory and so on. It's just some of the accounts payable, accounts receivable kind of thing. 
 Okay. Are there any other questions? 
Operator: There are. And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. 
Michael Sison: Seifi, I think you noted that Asia merchant recovered in -- or was down for 6 weeks and then sounds like maybe in week 7, week 8, things recovered. Can you maybe walk us through kind of what happened when you talk to customers that allowed the merchant business to recover in kind of 7 to 8 weeks? And if those events sort of transpire here in Europe and the U.S., do you think we could recover in that sort of similar time period? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, I think on that, what I can say is that obviously China did a great job in terms of dealing with the virus. I mean, they had a hard shutdown, which affected volumes and all of that significantly. But they took the pain and they contained the virus. And then when they opened the society back up in a normal way, then the volumes came back. So if in Europe and in the U.S., we act responsibly, the way they did, and have a hard shutdown and then open up our society responsibly, things will come back. But I just hope that we do the same thing that they did in China. The Chinese did a great job in containing this virus. It started there, but you know the statistics in terms of the number of cases they have. And right now, the Chinese society is functioning normally, and that is why our volumes are up.
 And actually, there are people who argue that actually the Chinese economy might benefit from what is going on because if Europe and the U.S. have issues to deal with, and industrial production and so on is down, then China has to make up for that and also for their own demand. So the Chinese economy might actually become better than it was before. But -- I mean, it all depends in terms of how we end up handling the situation in the U.S. and in Europe and how we come back from that. 
Michael Sison: Got it. And then just a follow up -- and just a quick follow up. When you think about the volume, merchant declines in Europe and Americas, how much of that is driven by actual plant shutdowns? Meaning, if those shutdowns kind of revert, auto and aerospace and other areas, is -- how quickly does that come back? Is that the bulk of the decline? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: So that is obviously the bulk of the decline. And also the consumer is not consuming the stuff and people are not producing that. But I'd just like to add that we feel can obligate -- as you know, we never, during our calls, comment on the current month. We don't comment on things in the middle of the quarter. But we decided to do that because of the focus that everybody has and we gave you the numbers as we see them in April. We are not projecting that those numbers will continue. We are not projecting that Europe will go down 25% the next month. We just told you what we see at this moment because we don't know how it's going to proceed. 
 Next month, if Europe decides to open up some of the areas because they feel more confident, that 25% might become 10%. So the main reason that we didn't give you guidance is because we just don't know and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But please take what we said in the context of what we are seeing. We are not projecting for you, we are not projecting that the U.S. merchant volumes will be down 25%. We just gave you an example of that. I've told you exactly what we see as of right now. 
Operator: And the next question will come from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. 
James Sheehan: So you noted that you have the top priority still of increasing your dividends. And over the past many years, you've increased it at a 10% annual rate or compound rate. Would you expect your dividend increase this year to be similar to prior years? Or would you change the amount of dividend increase, given the uncertainty of the current environment? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, the decision of how we've increased the dividend and how much we'd increase it by is obviously the decision by our Board of Directors. And the Board considers all of the different circumstances before they make that recommendation. But the one thing that I can tell you for sure is that we definitely are not decreasing the dividend. And my intent is to recommend to the Board to increase the dividend. The issue is by what percentage, and that I cannot kind of give you a number for that. We will see how it is.
 But you see our historical performance and we definitely are not going to decrease the dividend. And the amount of increase, we would like to increase it, I would like to increase it, and the amount of increase will be something that our Board will decide in January, as we usually do. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. 
Jonas Oxgaard: Two questions, if you don't mind. The first one is on Jazan. So my understanding from your last call was that you expect the gasifiers to be up and running shortly and the ASUs are obviously already running. So how -- what happens to the project when the -- when everything is actually running but ownership is still with Aramco? Does the earnings that come in just pay off corporate debt? Or how should we think about that? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, first of all, I don't want to speak for Aramco but the gasifiers are not running yet. But the very odd deal is, again, like any other deal, is that when we close the transaction, whether the gasifiers are running or not or whether the refinery is running or not, then Aramco owes us the monthly fee. That's the way it works. So the -- upon the close of the transaction, whatever is the state of the refinery, we will get our monthly fee, and therefore it will impact our EPS. Is that okay? 
Jonas Oxgaard: Yes, that's -- but the ASUs are running already, right? And they are owned by you, still, aren't they? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: The ASUs are still owned by us, and they are -- when you say running, they are being commissioned. We are not yet supplying oxygen for production to the refinery yet. But they are -- but the important thing is that we are getting the BFC per our contract with Aramco, or the ASU, which we own 25%. 
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay. Perfect. Then a separate question. So you referenced helium demand being strong, but since we're now reducing oil and gas production, and we're already in what looks like a global helium shortage, how do you see the helium supply/demand evolving over the next year if crude price stays where it is? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, first of all, helium demand, there are 2 main drivers for helium demand. One main driver is obviously the MRI machines. And unfortunately, those things are in more demand than they had before. Then the other thing -- the other for helium is balloons, birthday parties and all of that. That is a flexible demand. And depending on the price that business goes up and down. So in terms of helium demand, we have not seen a significant reduction on the demand. And as you said, the supply is still tight. But I would like to be excused from making too many comments about helium because it's obviously a very sensitive subject, considering the market and all of that, and I don't want to get ahead of ourselves in making too many comments about that. 
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. 
Laurence Alexander: Okay. Well, then very quickly, carbon sequestration. Do you have the skill set to do the sequestration component yourselves? Or is that something you need to do a JV on? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: I'm sorry, you cut out in the middle of your questions. Would you please repeat that? 
Laurence Alexander: Sure. So on carbon sequestration is -- just very quickly, on carbon sequestration, you mentioned earlier projects, the pipeline. Do you have this -- does Air Products have the skill set to do the sequestration steps themselves? Or is that something that would need to be outsourced or JV-ed? 
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, if you're talking about -- we obviously know how to capture the carbon and clean it up and all of that. Then the question becomes if -- just -- if you are doing EOR, we just put it in a pipeline and it goes for EOR. If it is a question of sequestering it, the know-how for the sequestration obviously belongs to some of the companies like Schlumberger, they can use all of that. And obviously, in those kind of situations, we will be either using them as subcontractors or something like that. I mean, I don't want to get too much into the details of that. But you know the system very well on how it works, yes? 
 Okay. With that, since that was the final question, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for listening to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and look forward to discussing our results with you next quarter. And as I said earlier, please stay safe, stay healthy, and all the best to all of you. And thank you again. 
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-01-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products & Chemicals’ First Quarter Earnings Release Call. Today’s call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. Beginning today’s call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Leanne. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products’ First Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I’m pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we’ll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide 2. In addition, throughout today’s discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless we specifically state otherwise, we are referring to adjusted non-GAAP measures, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin on both a company-wide and segment basis and ROCE. Reconciliations can be found on our website in the Relevant Earnings Release section. Now I’m pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. I would like to thank everybody at Air Products to again delivering a very strong quarter. We are very pleased with our earnings per share of $2.14 for the first quarter, up 15% over last year’s strong results and the 23rd, I’d like to repeat that, the 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. Please now turn to Slide Number 3. Safety is always the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal continues to be zero accidents and incidents. I was pleased to see improvement this quarter as our people redoubled their efforts so that we can move towards our ultimate goal of an accident-free work environment. Slide Number 4 shows our goal and Slide Number 5 shows our management philosophy. I have discussed this with you many times before, so I don’t want to take your time to repeat it, but those slides are very important guiding principles that we follow. Now please turn to Slide Number 6, our Five-Point Plan that we have discussed with you in detail before. But I do not want to focus on our past performance because, frankly, I like the dreams of the future more than the history of the past. Our dream of the future is to make sure Air Products will continue to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers. Our dream of the future is for Air Products to become the largest American chemical company as measured by market capitalization. We will achieve this by focusing on growth, driven by our core competencies. Our dream of the future is for Air Products to be the leader in providing solutions to the world’s environmental sustainability challenges through gasification of coal, pet coke and refinery residues, developing solutions to capture CO2 from gasifiers and hydrogen plants and further developing technologies and making Air Products the leader in providing hydrogen for transportation around the world. Our dream of the future is to be a company that has a higher purpose beyond just creating value for our shareholders through improved financial performance. We want to be a company that people from all walks of life and nationalities come together, work together and feel that they belong and that their contribution matters and are appreciated; a company that is focused on innovation to solve the substantial environmental issues facing our humanity; a company that is passionate and contribute to the well-being of all the communities in which we operate around the world; a global company that brings people from all over the world together to collaborate, improve understanding and prevent conflicts that arise from misunderstanding. We are committed to work very hard to realize our dreams of the future by executing on our Five-Point Plan strategy. Now please turn to Slide Number 7. You can see our exciting gasification strategy. We continue to be very focused on successfully executing this strategy and the announced projects, and we are making excellent progress, and we continue to be very optimistic about this sector. Slide Number 8 summarizes the Gulf Coast Ammonia project we announced earlier in January. As I said, this is the largest U.S. investment in the history of Air Products and winning this project is a direct result of the value of our Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline, the competitiveness of our hydrogen plants and our expertise to develop, build and operate the largest projects in the history of industrial gas industry. As a result, this project will exceed our commitments in terms of financial returns. Please now turn to Slide Number 9. We have talked extensively about the significant opportunities for capital investment to generate significant shareholder value. At the same time, the cash generation strength of our existing business allows us to be confident in raising our dividend for the 38th consecutive year. The more than 15% increase we announced yesterday to $1.34 per share per quarter is the largest per share dividend increase in our history and will result in almost $1.2 billion directly returned to our shareholders in form of dividend next year. Now please turn to my favorite slide, Slide Number 10. You can see that our EBITDA margin continues to be more than 40%, which is up over 1,500 basis points from early 2014. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to give you the details of our very good financial performance. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 11 for our first quarter results. Our team delivered another strong start to the year. Volume and price together increased 9% and were up in all three regions. We delivered double-digit profit growth despite the soft economic activity around the world. Sales grew modestly to $2.3 billion as strong underlying sales were offset by 5% lower energy pass-through and 2% due to the India contract modification. The India contract was modified in December 2018. So this is the last quarter we will see a year-on-year impact. Weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Chinese RMB and euro lowered sales by another 1%. Volume growth of 6% was primarily driven by modest base business growth, new plants, acquisitions and a short-term contract in Asia. Price was up 3%, the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price increase. EBITDA topped $900 million, up 14%, and EPS of $2.14 was up 15%. EBITDA margin was over 40%, the third consecutive quarter exceeding the 40% mark, up 460 basis points, primarily driven by the higher price and the strong volumes. Lower energy pass-through and the India contract modification contributed about half of the margin increase. Sequentially, profits are down, primarily on seasonality in the regions and incentive compensation adjustments primarily in our corporate segment. ROCE continues to improve up 100 basis points over last year. We are pleased with the almost 300 basis point improvement since 2015 and we anticipate further improvement as we increase earnings and deploy more of the cash on our balance sheet. Now please turn to Slide 12. Our fourth quarter EPS of $2.14 was up $0.28 per share or 15% driven by strong operating performance. Volume and price together contributed $0.40, cost was unfavorable $0.12 as we continued to invest in business development and R&D resources to support our growth strategy. Equity affiliate income was favorable $0.02, while non-controlling interest was unfavorable $0.02. The non-operating factors in total have no net impact this quarter. Our effective tax rate of 19.8% was up 80 basis points from last year. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of 20% to 21% in fiscal year 2020. Interest expense was $0.07 lower this quarter as we paid off a bond last quarter and adopted new accounting guidance that moves about $9 million per quarter from interest expense to non-operating expense. Now please turn to Slide 13. We continue to generate strong cash flow. For the last 12 months, we generated over $2.7 billion or $12.30 per share of distributable cash flow. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost 40% or $1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.7 billion available for high return industrial gas investments. As Seifi mentioned, this strong cash flow enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. Slide number 14 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we now show over $18 billion of investment capacity available over the five year period from FY2018 through FY2022. As expected, our total capacity continues to grow as we increase EBITDA. The over $18 billion includes almost $10 billion of additional debt capacity available today, almost $5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY2022 and over $3 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. Today we have a total of about $8 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $7 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent 20% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I’ll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. I’m very pleased to say that we generated excellent results in all our operating geographies. All three regions reported double-digit profit growth and significant margin expansion. We are not depending on economic growth around the world, but are meeting our commitments to you through our own actions by realizing value we provide to our customers and by successfully executing high return growth projects. Now please turn to Slide number 15, where you can see that our team in Asia has again delivered another set of outstanding results. As we have previously mentioned, trade tensions have not significantly impacted our business, our customers and the Chinese government continues to support Air Products projects and we remain very optimistic about our long-term prospects in this important region of the world. For the quarter, sales increased 11% from last year with volume and price together up 13%. Volumes increased 9% driven by new projects, base business growth and a short-term supply contract. As a reminder, the year-on-year impact of Lu’An has lapsed since the project has been successfully operating for more than a year. Overall pricing for the region increased 4%, and actually our merchant pricing increased by 10%, the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Price was positive in all key countries. Profits and margins were higher, driven by the strong volume and price. EBITDA increased 16% and EBITDA margin expanded 260 points to just over 50%. Sequentially, sales and profit soften as the impact of lower volumes including less benefit from the short-term supply contracts was partially offset by productivity. As you would expect, we do anticipate a seasonal slowdown during Lunar New Year holiday in quarter two. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas result. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our Americas results. Americas’ strong pricing trend continued, up 3%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of the year-on-year improvement. Price was better across all major product lines and in all subregions. Volume was up 1% driven by stronger Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes with less planned customer maintenance outages than last year. This was partially offset by persistent economic weakness in South America. Lower energy pass-through reduced sales by 8%. EBITDA of $410 million increased 11% supported by a better price, higher volume and lower maintenance costs. EBITDA margin of almost 44% was up almost 700 basis points, primarily due to better price, lower maintenance and improved productivity. Energy pass-through also contributed about 300 basis points. Looking into next quarter, we anticipate higher and above average maintenance spending due to planned life extension work on several facilities. We expect our full year maintenance expense to be within our normal range. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa results. Our EMEA business continued to generate strong price, volume and profit growth despite the challenging economic conditions in the region. Volume was up 6%, primarily driven by increased hydrogen volumes in our Rotterdam pipeline system and the CO2 business we acquired last year, while base merchant business volume remains stable. Price increased 3% with improvement across all major products and subregions. This is the eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Sales were negatively impacted by 8% from the India contract change, 4% from lower energy pass-through and 2% from unfavorable currency. As Scott mentioned, the India contract was modified in December of 2018, so this is the last quarter we will see a year-on-year impact. EBITDA of $188 million was up 14% supported by the strong price and volume. And EBITDA margin of nearly 38% improved over 600 basis points. The India contract change in lower energy pass-through contributed about 400 basis points of this improvement. Now please turn to Slide 18, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sales equipment businesses as well as central industrial gas costs. Other project activities offset the expected lower results from the successful Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. However, we don’t expect these other project activities to continue at this level. Please turn to Slide 19. Corporate segment, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales were higher this quarter, supported by contributions from the Golden Pass LNG project. Profits were flat as the improved contribution from LNG was offset by higher corporate costs as we continue to build our capabilities and strengthen our organization to successfully pursue our significant growth opportunities. Sequentially, results were down as LNG had a lower quarter on normal sale of equipment profit timing, and we saw relatively higher costs, including incentive compensation. We remain very optimistic about additional LNG orders since our technology has been selected for several major projects around the world that are awaiting final investment decisions or final agreements with our customers. Now I’m pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, again, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 20. As you all know, and it’s pretty obvious, we continue to live in an uncertain world that we at Air Products cannot control. But we do have control over the actions Air Products can take to succeed in a dynamic and changing world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization that remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promise to investors. Despite this uncertainty, there is no change in our fiscal year 2020 EPS guidance of $9.35 to $9.60, which is up 14% to 17% over our strong fiscal year 2019 performance. As we continue to expect our fiscal – we continue to expect our fiscal year 2020 CapEx to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. For second quarter of fiscal year 2020, our earnings per share guidance is $2.10 to $2.20, which at midpoint is up 12% versus last year. Now please turn to Slide 21. At midpoint, our fiscal year 2020 guidance represents six consecutive years of double-digit earnings growth and 14% average earnings per share growth over this time. Thanks to the great team at Air Products, we continue to deliver on our commitments. Our team around the world continues to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products. Our Five-Point strategic plan will differentiate us and drive our success going forward. Our safety, productivity and operating performance provide the foundation for our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technical position and the talent to take a full advantage of our exciting opportunities, and I’d like to stress that we see – we do see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead of us. And finally, please turn to Slide 22. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our strong performance. I want to thank all of our 17,000 people around the world for their commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. I certainly am proud to be part of this winning team. With that, now we are delighted to answer any questions that you might have.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Can you describe your volume growth in oxygen and nitrogen in the United States in the merchant area?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, good morning.
Jeff Zekauskas: Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: We would prefer not to get into that detail, Jeff. Because that is obviously a very significant competitive information, and we usually do not disclose that. I’m sorry about that. But hope you bear with us that we want to stick with that policy.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. You’re going to spend $4 billion to $4.5 billion in CapEx this year. Does that amount of spending lead to some costs coming into the income statement in advance of the capital projects coming on stream? In other words, are your current returns being penalized at all by the large capital expenditure budget that you have for this year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, you make a very good point. As you notice from our results, our cost, I mean, if you focus on the cost, you see increasing cost. That’s not because we have become less efficient. That is because we are building the organization in anticipation of executing these projects. So you are very correct that we will see, as you are seeing, some increase in cost. It is not that significant, but it is there, and you’re very – it’s very appropriate for you to point that out.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone. I have a follow-up on the $0.12 of cost increase in the quarter. The investments you’re making to grow the business, Jeff, obviously, just talked about the existing plants. How much of the spend is going towards future opportunities like hydrogen mobility or other things because I was just curious on the R&D side of the equation, what it is that you’re driving at?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the expenditures are in two aspects. One is, obviously, R&D expenditure, which is you kind of know about how much we are spending, it is not that huge. But the other thing is actually hiring very high quality, experienced people to oversee the execution of these projects that we expect to get. We don’t want to get the projects and then look for talent. We are putting the talent in place in anticipation of those projects, which we are sure will happen. So a significant part of the cost is the hiring and onboarding of all of these people, and there is a substantial number of people that we have brought in, especially to strengthen our technology section and our project execution capability.
Vincent Andrews: Got it. That makes sense. If I could just ask a follow-up on the dividend. Obviously, a very large increase, a record increase. Last year, when we talked about it, you mentioned that you historically has spoken to your investors about a 2.5% to 3% yield. Obviously, this takes you to about 2.25%. My assumption is that with the increase in the share price last year to go back to 2.50% to 3% would have been perhaps unattractive in terms of moving cash flow away from investment projects. But I guess the question is, how should we think about sort of the dividend growth algorithm going forward? Should we be thinking more about keeping the yield at 2.25% to 2.5% or what philosophy can you help us with this year?
Seifi Ghasemi: That’s an excellent question. We obviously take a lot of different factors into consideration when we decide on the dividend. It’s not just 2.5% of the stock price, but it’s also our cash flow. I think you should expect that we would continue to give approximately half of our free cash flow as dividends. That has been kind of one guidance, and obviously, a percentage of the share price is another part. I personally think that we should continue to pay a very healthy dividend, something which is in the order of 2.5% of our share price and also about half of our free cash. So this year, I mean, we are increasing it 15%. It would have been ridiculous if we had to start right now and we can’t anticipate what the share price will be. So we make the decision based on a lot of different factors that’s in – but overall guidance, about half of our free cash or about 2.5% of the share price.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, very helpful. I appreciate it.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Seifi, if I back out the effect of the India contract modification, it looks like your volume grew about 6% year-over-year. And so I have a two-part question. First, I was wondering if you could comment as to the effect of new projects in that number versus baseline volume growth? And then secondly, since you’re one of the first chemical companies to report this season, just wondering if you could comment on which end-use markets might have trended better than expected? And if there are any that came in lower than your expectation? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Kevin. Excellent question. In terms of breaking down between organic growth and new projects, our basic approach has been not to disclose that detail. But I would like to specifically answer your second question. We obviously beat the forecast. The reason for that is that the economic growth in Asia was better than we expected. The economic growth in Europe didn’t become as bad as we expected because of Brexit. And in the U.S., there was not much of a change, and Latin America continues to be a disaster. So overall, as we go forward, we are now a little bit more optimistic about Asia. Obviously, in the second quarter, you have the Lunar New Year and that dampens the growth, but we expect that to continue as we go forward in the other quarters. And I’m hoping that things will kind of stabilize in Europe and in the U.S. But that’s kind of how we see the thing.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Kevin.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Can you just give us a real quick update on your various Saudi projects, primarily Jazan, the MOUs and just the future potential for a pipeline build-out? Just any additional framework on Saudi Arabia will be appreciated. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, Chris. Chris, obviously, we are very honored and very proud to be given the gigantic project of the integrated gas project in Jazan. That is not only an equivalent of a $12 billion acquisition, but it also is a phenomenal reference in terms of our gasification capability. It is using the Shell technology and it is a gigantic project. So we are very happy with that. We are making a lot of progress on that. And I continue to be very optimistic that we will try – that we will be kind of complete the financing in this quarter. But you do need to appreciate, and I’m sure you do, that we are going to go to the market for $7 billion of debt considering the different events in the world and all of that, things might not happen exactly on the date. But the fact of the matter is that we are talking about a 25-year project. So the impact on Air Product for the long-term is extremely positive. Now whether we actually close in the month of March or whether it is in the month of April, we’ll see. But we continue to be very optimistic about that project. As I said, we are very proud of that. And quite frankly, you see that we have not changed our forecast. That means that we still believe that this will happen at the time that we thought at the beginning of the year. Is that okay, Chris?
Christopher Parkinson: That’s very helpful. Just as a quick follow-up and a little bit longer-term one. Just carbon capture was just indistinctly a clear theme at Davos this year and was basically discussed across by pretty much every global leader, the IEA and plethora of oil companies, all of them with their own partner proprietary technology. Can you just update us on your own thoughts on this front? Whether your technologies fit into the broader equation? And how the investment community should at least begin to think about this opportunity as it pertains to Air Products? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Chris, we have recognized and made carbon capture a priority for the company five years ago. That is the future. That is a necessity in order to deal with the global warming. And I am very happy to see that responsible people are now actually talking about it. Hopefully, we were ahead of the game. We have been working on different technologies on this. The first thing is that we do have the technology to capture carbon from hydrogen plants and I think gasifiers and so on for enhanced oil recovery. We do have a commercial scale plant operating in Port Arthur. It’s one of the biggest in the world, and we capture the CO2 and put it in the pipeline there for enhanced oil recovery. That kind of projects you should expect that we will do on a very large-scale around the world. The second thing is sequestration. We have developed technologies on that and we are working on that. And hopefully, in time, we will be able to announce the kind of commercial projects that we are doing. The third and most exciting thing is some new technologies that we are developing. And in respect to carbon capture in a different way, I don’t want to go through the details of that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at this stage. We are laser-focused on carbon capture. If you look at our annual report, and we make it very clear, we say gasification today, carbon capture tomorrow and hydrogen for mobility the day after tomorrow. So, those are the priorities of our company, and we are obviously trying to be the leader on that, the same way that we became the leader in gasification.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. With regard to coal gasification in China, can you give us an update on the market there and what you’re seeing in terms of interest and demand? I know certainly over the last year or so, there was a lot of demand and a lot of talk about it. We haven’t necessarily seen a lot of new announcements. So I guess, can you give us an update on your confidence in that area?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, good morning, John. Hope all is well. We continue to be optimistic about that. We did announce the coal gasification project, as I’m sure you saw, and we expect to announce some more in the years to come. We are working on Juitai. We announced Debang and there are other projects. We don’t see any slowdown on that, and we are very optimistic about that, John.
John McNulty: Great, thanks. And then just a question on the helium markets. Can you speak to kind of what you’re seeing in the industry right now and how you’re seeing how that plays out through 2020?
Seifi Ghasemi: But John, I think it is not a secret that supply-demand situation in helium is challenging. Basically, there is not enough supply to meet the demand. And obviously, that has had an effect on the commercial value of helium. And you can – and you are seeing that in our results. In terms of 2020, I think that situation will continue, and it is quite possible that, that situation will continue for a few years to come. I don’t want to anticipate that because it depends on the performance of the current sources or bringing on a stream of some other sources. But helium has such a small number of sources and so on. So, it’s very transparent about what’s going on. There are not that many places that produce helium. So it’s very easy for investors and people like yourself to figure out what’s going on.
John McNulty: Great, thanks very much for the color.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, David.
David Begleiter: Can you give any new update on the Yankuang project? It’s a large one, and it’s still, I guess, progressing a little bit slowly here?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. There is no additional update. I’ve always mentioned that, that project is a big project. We signed the Memorandum of Understanding in November of 2017 when the President was visiting China. That project is moving very slowly. Some of it is our fault. I have explained that, that we want to make sure that there is coal allocation before we go and invest $1.5 billion of our money there. So I think you should expect a slow progress on that project.
David Begleiter: Got it. And do you have the merchant price increases for both the Americas and EMEA, you gave us the Asia price increase? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Merchant price increases are the way we see it. Americas is about 7%, Europe is about 5%, and Asia is 10%.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: We usually don’t disclose that detail, but since you asked the question, David, I had to answer you.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, P.J. How are you?
P.J. Juvekar: I’m doing great. Your EBITDA margins were 40%, which is great. If you take out the energy pass-through, EBITDA margins were closer to 37% to 38% and then there was also positive impact of India contract modification. So it seems like your sort of same-store EBITDA margins are in that mid-30s to maybe high 30s range. Is that a good range going forward? And how will the new coal gasification projects and your build-own operate model sort of impact those margins in the future?
Seifi Ghasemi: Order of magnitude, your math is correct, and we expect the margins to – sorry, the margins to continue to be in the range that you mentioned. But as we do these bigger projects that will improve. That has – that will have a positive effect on those margins. Sorry, I’m losing my voice a little bit. But – so overall, you should expect that our margins will stay at around 38%, 37% to 40%, 49% – I mean, 39%, 40%, around that range.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. While you take a breath, let me ask a question to Scott. Working capital was a drag. And I’m sure that was partly driven by new project startups, but your receivables were down, payables were up. Can you sort of shed more light on working capital drag? And how much of that impact is from new startups?
Scott Crocco: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, P.J. Our DSO was about 52 days. So we’re in good shape, and we constantly monitor that. What you’re seeing this quarter is really driven by the timing between our SOE opportunities and some of the timing difference between when we’re booking earnings versus the collection of cash. So nothing systemic, and we’ll see that bounce around. So – but thanks for the question.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Mike. How are you?
Mike Harrison: Doing well. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Asia business, and you’ve referenced the short term contract, which I believe also contributed last quarter. But can you just provide some additional detail on how much of that was contributing to revenues in the quarter? And how we should think about that contribution for the rest of fiscal 2020?
Seifi Ghasemi: It is a small contribution that we actually had, but it’s not material and it’s not going to change things that much.
Mike Harrison: All right. And the other question I had is on hydrogen. I believe you mentioned – you called out strength in the Gulf Coast as well as in Europe. Just wondering if you can provide any sense of what’s driving that? And then it sounds like – just looking for clarification, it sounds like the turnaround activity was maybe a little bit lower than you expected, but maybe maintenance cost go up in Q2 and net-net about normal in terms of overall maintenance activity for the full year. Is that – do I understand that correctly?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Number one, I think, as Scott mentioned in his comments that we expect a higher maintenance cost in the second quarter because of the timing. But for the year, we expect our maintenance cost to be what number that we have discussed with you before, which is order of magnitude $250 million, $260 million a year. With respect to hydrogen demand, it is not huge, but we do see some effect because of the IMO 2020 that people need more hydrogen in order to clean up the fuel.
Mike Harrison: All right. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi Duffy. How are you?
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks. First question is just around the capital. It looks like you’re going to increase your capital spend about 300% per quarter, if you kind of rough the Q4 – the Q1 number to get to your annual number. What does that end up doing to your tax rate as you shift your geographic footprint over time?
Seifi Ghasemi: I’d like Scott to answer that, but while he is kind of pulling his stats together. And obviously, you know that the reason for that is because we expect a big chunk of capital expenditure because of Jazan when we close. So that is one of the reasons that the number kind of looks, hey, this quarter, it was this, and suddenly, it’s going to go up. That is because of Jazan. In terms of the effect, in terms of our tax, I don’t think it is material, but I’d like Scott to comment on that.
Scott Crocco: Yes, sure. Thanks, Duffy. So as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for the year we expect it still to be in the 20% to 21% book effective tax rate. And obviously, that will move around quarter-to-quarter, be dependent on where – how much money we make and where we make it. But even going forward on the other side of the Jazan, I would still put it in that sort of range. I will also mention, though, so that’s a book tax rate. From a cash tax perspective, we’ve historically seen in the kind of the mid-teens. And similarly, it depends on where and how much we make. But I would expect it to maybe be the mid-to-upper teens on a cash tax basis, okay?
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks. And then in what was resoundingly a good quarter, the most eye-popping number to me was the 10% pricing in the merchant business in Asia. Can you just talk about the supply-demand dynamics? How strong that market feels? And how resilient that kind of pricing momentum feels going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: We feel optimistic about that. You obviously appreciate the nature of the industry, and we don’t want to comment on pricing. So I don’t want to say too much, but we continue to think that there is a good supply-demand situation that, that kind of pricing will continue.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Jim Sheehan: Good morning. On your return on capital employed number, a little over 13% and expanding, where do you think that number can get to after some of the very large projects start-up over the next few years?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jim, that’s a good question. We have always said that our target is 15%. So we would like to get it to 15% and I think in time, we will get there. Actually, as we spend more cash, that number will go up because the way we calculate the return, it includes the cash. So if tomorrow, we spent all the cash on projects that number will enhance. Other people don’t include the cash because – so as a result of that, I mean, you understand the dynamics of the top of the line and the bottom of the line. But fundamentally, we are looking forward to increasing that number to 15%. And Scott has a comment that he wants to add.
Scott Crocco: I just want to build on it and already, if you take a look at our cash on hand, if you were to look at it on a net debt basis, net of the cash, it’s already almost 16% roughly.
Jim Sheehan: Terrific. And on your pricing trends, you’ve been very disciplined about raising prices, and it looks like the supply-demand balance is supporting that. Just curious if you’re starting to see any signs of market share loss as a result of your pricing execution?
Seifi Ghasemi: I don’t want to claim that we have not had any market share loss, but it has not been significant or material, but we might have some. When – we were very open about this thing in February of last year when we said year when we said that we are – we need to recover some of our cost as we said before we expect and we are going to – willing to live with market share loss, but we have not seen a significant one, but there might be some here and there. I don’t want to claim we haven’t lost anything. But it isn’t anything that would force us to change our strategy.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Thank you. If the sequential pricing just rounding down to 0% or is it close to 0.5% or so, so that the year-over-year pricing for the overall company will stay up near 3% over the next few quarters?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, you really do your homework, John. I’m very impressed that you are providing that detail, a lot of credit to you. It is rounding down. It is actually up sequential.
John Roberts: And then if you built a bridge between the December quarter earnings and the March quarter earnings here, you mentioned that the Lunar New Year will be a sequential headwind. Could you talk about sequentially, from an earnings perspective, any other puts and takes as we go from December quarter to March quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that when we give you the guidance, obviously, we need to look at everything. And we debated this thing quite a bit yesterday, quite honestly. And that is the dynamic of the Lunar New Year, which we always – we don’t know exactly how it will work out. And then there is obviously the headline in the papers that you see about this virus thing. So how would that develop and how the effect of that. That is why we decided to take the two into consideration and expand the range. We usually give you guidance within $0.05. This time we are giving you guidance within $0.10. So that is our thinking right now, that’s our best judgment.
John Roberts: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.
Jonas Oxgaard: Hi, good morning guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning. How are you?
Jonas Oxgaard: I am great. I was hoping to get some help tying some numbers, is that two-part if you don’t mind. But the first one is, you announced the $500 million project a few weeks ago and I see in your CapEx, you raised it by $500 million, but you had some other announcements in the quarter as well, like the South Korea project. So where did the CapEx from South Korea and others go? Did some projects fall out?
Seifi Ghasemi: No. I don’t think anything has fall out. Simon does these numbers in detail. So Simon, would you like to comment, please.
Simon Moore: Sure. Jonas, sorry if we miscommunicated. I think our CapEx guidance, our expected spending for the year has not changed, quite frankly. You could also expect that when we give you CapEx guidance, it may include projects that haven’t yet been announced but we’re highly confident about. I would also just add the Gulf Coast Ammonia we just announced that there wouldn’t be a huge amount of spending in this fiscal year anyway.
Jonas Oxgaard: Also, I meant that long-term committed to the spend the – what is it $10.3 billion?
Simon Moore: Sure. So obviously, we continue to spend money on projects that continue to come on stream and so that numbers come up a little bit
Jonas Oxgaard: Yes. But the question is, the number came up $500 million, which is exactly the project you announced in the Gulf Coast, right? Yet there were other announcements in that same quarter that apparently didn’t make it into the sum total.
Seifi Ghasemi: It’s because some of the projects have come on stream, and when they come on stream, they are taken off of the – off of what we say as backlog.
Simon Moore: And Jonas, I guess, I would just point to the fact that when we give you a backlog number, it may include at times projects that we haven’t announced yet if we’re highly certain of them.
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay. That makes sense. The other thing I was trying to tie was the guidance for the year didn’t change even though you beat pretty handily. Is the inference the slipping of Jazan? Or how should I think about that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it’s becoming – we need to put everything together. But obviously, this quarter, our results are better than expectation. We had told you $205 million to $210 million and we delivered $214 million. So as a result, we felt better about our base business, and therefore, but there are – the timing of the Jazan thing. So at the end of the day, we made the judgment that overall we should be able to meet our commitment.
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Jonas.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hey guys. Nice quarter.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thanks, Mike.
Mike Sison: You noted that Lu’An has anniversaried – I think it’s your first sort of major gasification project. Can you maybe talk about what you’ve learned from running it for a year? Any positive surprises, negative surprises? Obviously, it’s done well. Just kind of wanted your thoughts on how that has done over the last year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well. Thank you for asking that question because I wanted to brag about it a little bit, quite honestly. We have had a very positive experience. Number one, our expectation of the amount of time that we can keep the project online when we started and people will tell you gasifiers or something like 85%, 86%, we have had those gasifiers online for more than 95% of the time. So that is very good news. The second thing is that in terms of financial performance is exactly as we thought. And the third thing is that we have learned a lot by operating these shared gasifiers first hand. And we are seeing some positive impacts that we will incorporate in the future projects. And I’m also very proud of our people that we gave them this and we had to put in something like 500 new people on this thing. We have operated this thing, knocking on board very safely and very efficiently. So it has been a very positive experience, and it significantly has increased our confidence in taking on new projects.
Mike Sison: Got it. Thank you. And then just one quick one on the range for the year. Just curious, at the high end, what do you think needs to happen to sort of be close to that end versus sort of the midpoint or the lower end?
Seifi Ghasemi: We need to get lucky with the economy and close Jazan in time, so.
Mike Sison: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Seifi, if a partner were to come to you and offer you either an excess supply of energy or maybe a renewable energy supply, do you have the capability of producing hydrogen from electrolysis?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, we do. And we already do that. We have the capability and we are pursuing projects in that – of that nature.
Steve Byrne: And when you look out longer-term, Seifi, in your – in this pursuit of hydrogen for transportation, how would you rank that technology versus the standard of methane reforming versus this more recent project with using ammonia as a carrier of hydrogen?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think that the world is moving toward green hydrogen. And green hydrogen is obviously using solar and then electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen. We think that is the future and a significant number of projects will be done in that way. And that is where we are building our capability. You are very right, that is the future. We definitely think that is the future. Yes, ammonia thing is obviously a special issue, which is transportation of hydrogen. But you should think that people would use solar in order to make green hydrogen and then take that green hydrogen converted to ammonia and then send it to Japan.
Steve Byrne: And with respect to carbon sequestration, is that Gulf Coast Ammonia project of yours have any requirements on you to sequester the CO2?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, not the Gulf Coast. We got the permit – we are not recovering CO2 at that plant at this time.
Steve Byrne: Yes, I was really referring to the long-term contracts for this ammonia. Is there any component of that that is expecting that the carbon to be sequestered?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, there is no such requirement.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning, guys. Two quick ones. Can you help us with the effective tailwind for next year from the projects that are lapping next year and then the new projects coming on, just so we can get a sense for how much of a deceleration compared to this year is implied by the backlog? And secondly, on carbon sequestration, I think a lot of the environmental debate focuses on the relative cost versus mitigation coming out at about 5 times to 10 times the cost of mitigating through, for example, tree planting. But obviously, carbon sequestration has the virtue that is a project you control. Can you give us a sense for how you’re thinking about sequestration versus mitigation? And how quickly you can bring down the cost of the sequestration technology?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think all of these questions that you’re asking in terms of the carbon capture and so on depends on the location that we are – you are and which part of the world you are and what are the incentives and all of that. So it will be difficult to give you a general answer. With respect to your first question, with respect to – I do not see any drag on our results next year as a result of the project. So I’m not sure I fully understood your question. We expect that for 2021 our EPS will grow another 10% versus 2020. We don’t expect any deceleration.
Laurence Alexander: Okay, great.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much. With that, I think that was the last question that people have signed up for. So I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your very busiest schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. In the meantime, have a great day, and have a nice quarter and expect some good results from Air Products when we announce our results next quarter. Thanks, again. Have a nice day.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-11-08 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved.Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Leanne [ph], and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products fourth quarter 2019 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions.Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two. In addition, throughout today's discussion, we will refer to various financial measures. Unless, we specifically state otherwise, we are referring to adjusted non-GAAP measures, including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin on both the company-wide and segment basis, and ROCE. Reconciliations can be found on our website in the relevant earnings release section. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We are very pleased that our record fiscal year earnings per share of $8.21 represents our fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, and our earnings per share of $2.27 for the quarter also represents and another record, up 14% over the last year's strong results, and is the 22nd, and I’d like to stress 22nd consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. Scott will comment on our financial results in more details. So I'm going to focus my comments on safety, our higher purpose as a company, the very large acquisition in Saudi Arabia that they announced last week, and the press release we issued yesterday.Now please turn to Slide #3. Safety without question is job number one for all of us at Air Products. And our goal has always been zero accidents and zero incidents. Although you can see our good progress versus 2014, our safety performance in 2019 was not acceptable as we did not show improvement versus 2018. Our people are certainly redoubling their efforts in this area, so that we can move toward our ultimate goal of an accident-free work environment.Now, please send to Slide #6, our Five-Point Plan. I want to comment on point number five on the right hand side, which describes our higher purpose. We believe that in addition to creating value for our shareholders, through strong financial results, we do have a responsibility as a public company to define the higher purpose in what we view. Our higher purpose at Air Products is to create a diverse company that people from all around the world and from all sections of the society feel they belong and are treated as an equal part of the team, a company that people's contributions are recognized and appropriately rewarded, a company that people want to work for where they are proud to be part of the innovative process to solve the world's energy and environmental challenges, a company that is absolutely committed to sustainability and to the environments, and a company that is supportive of the local communities where we live and work. That is our higher purpose and we are committed to it.Now, please go to Slide #9 please to discuss our very large $11.5 billion acquisition in Saudi Arabia. You have seen this picture before, but it has been updated to reflect the latest information. Saudi Aramco is close to completing the construction of a 400,000 barrel per day refinery in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The highest sulfur vacuum resid from this refinery can no longer be used to few ships due to the new IMO 2020 regulation. Therefore, this liquid resid will be mixed with oxygen and gasified to produce synthetic gas. This same gas is almost equivalent to natural gas and it will be used to drive turbines to produce 3,900 megawatt of power. The joint venture is acquiring all of the assets, including air separation units, the gasifiers, power generation and the related utilities for almost $11.5 billion. The joint venture will own an operative facility and deliver power and hydrogen to Saudi Aramco for a monthly fee. This, of course, is the same business model as our traditional onsite business.Now please go to Slide #10. This very large acquisition will be owned by new joint venture company called The Jazan Integrated Gasification Company. The joint venture will be owned 20% by Saudi Aramco, 25% by Aqua Power, the largest independent power producer in the Middle East, 46% directly by Air Products, and 9% by products Air Products Qudra, which we call APQ, which is a joint venture of Air Products and Qudra Energy, there Air Products owns 51%, so Air Products’ total ownership will be just over 50%.Now please turn to Slide #11. The acquisition will be funded by 40% equity from the shareholders and 60% debt. In terms of timing, we had expected the transaction to be closed by the end of calendar 2019. But recently we have been informed that due to the extensive documentation required to launch the financing, the closing here now expected to be in the first quarter of calendar year 2020.In terms of accounting, at this point, we are not expecting to consolidate the full financial results of this entity in Air Products, so that results will be reflected in equity affiliated income. Based on the ownership percentage and the debt to equity split, Air Products’ cash contribution to this project will be $2.3 billion.We do not – and I’d like to stress, we do not plan to disclose the details of this project in terms of profitability. But I do want to confirm for you that the return on this investment will be better than the general guidance for investment that we have given to our investors in the past. As for the press release we issued last night, that is related to our plan to build an industrial gas pipeline system in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, which could be similar to our hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen pipeline system in the U.S. Golf Coast to sell all of the refineries and chemical plants in that part of the world. The press release confirms that The Royal Commission has given us permission to proceed with the project, and we will update you about this project every quarter in terms of what we are doing. This is a major step forward for us in Saudi Arabia in addition to the acquisition.Now, please turn to my favorite Slide #13. You can see our record EBITDA margin of almost 42%, which is up almost 1,700 basis points from early 2014.Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to give you the details of our financial performance. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 14 for our full year results. We delivered another strong year of underlying sales growth and very strong profit growth despite modest economic activity around the world. Sales of almost $9 billion were flat versus last year, as 2% volume growth and 3% price were offset by non operational factors. Specifically, weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Chinese RMB, euro and British pound lowered sales by 3%, and the India contract modification, which had no profit impact, reduced sales by another 2% compared to prior year. The volume growth was primarily driven by new plants, particularly, Lu'An, and supported by positive base volume.Sales from the very successful Jazan sales equipment project were lower as the project nears completion. This negatively impacted volumes by 2%. We saw price improvement in all three regions and across major product lines. Strong price and volume led to another year of double-digit profit growth despite currency headwinds. EBITDA improved 11% to nearly $3.5 billion. EBITDA margin of 38.9% was up 400 basis points, primarily due to the better price and volume. The India contract modification contributed 80 basis points. Record earnings per share of $8.21, was up 10% versus prior year. Our FY '19 CapEx of $2.1 billion was lower than we had forecasted on project and M&A timing, and ROCE improved 70 basis points to 13.1%.Now please turn to Slide 15. Our full year EPS from continuing operations of $8.21 increased by $0.76 per share, driven by our strong operating performance. Price, volume and costs combined contributed over $1 per share, and excluding the impact of negative currency, EPS in total was up nearly $1 or 13% compared to prior year, a slightly higher tax rate of 19.4% reduced EPS by $0.09, and other items together added $0.01. This includes higher non-controlling interest, primarily due to the Lu'An project. We expect an effective tax rate of 20% to 21% in fiscal year 2020Now please turn to Slide 16. We continue to generate strong cash flow. For the full fiscal year 2019, we generated almost $2.7 billion or over $12 per share of distributable cash flow. This is an increase of almost 20% or close to $2 per share from 2018. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost 40% or $1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have nearly $1.7 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.Slide #17 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we now show almost $18 billion of investment capacity available over the five-year period from FY 2018 through FY 2022. As expected, our total capacity continues to grow as we increased EBITDA. The almost $18 billion includes about $9.5 billion of additional debt capacity available today, $5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22, and over $3 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. Today we have a total of about $7.6 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $6.6 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see we've already spent 18% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity.Now please turn to Slide 18 for a few comments on our fourth quarter results. Sales of $2.3 billion were roughly flat as 8% volume and price growth was offset by lower energy pass-through, the India contract modification and negative currency impact. Volume added 5% due to new plants, base growth, acquisitions and a short-term contract in Asia. Lower Jazan sales equipment activity reduced sales by 2%. Price was up 3% with strong performance in all three regions, continuing the positive trend from prior quarters. Although unfavorable currency persisted, EBITDA of almost $1 billion improved 16%, and EPS of $2.27, was up 14%. EBITDA margin of almost 42% is up over 600 basis points, primarily driven by a higher price and the strong volumes. Lower energy pass-through and the India contract modification contributed about 200 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 7%, as all segments improved, particularly Asia, driven by strong volume performance.Please turn to Slide 19. Our fourth quarter EPS of $2.27 was up 14%, or $0.27 per share. Volume, price and costs together contributed almost $0.40, extending the strong operating performance from prior quarters. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.03 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB, the euro and the British Pound. Our effective tax rate of 20.2% was 260 basis points higher than last year's lower than typical rate, which reduced EPS by $0.08. Non-controlling interest, primarily due to Lu'An, reduced EPS by $0.04.Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. Before I get into the segment results for this quarter, please turn to Slide #20, there you can see the regional EBITDA margins for the year. Our teams have worked very hard to make significant improvements, especially with modest economic growth globally.Now please turn to Slide #21, there you can see the impressive results generated by our business in Asia. This strong performance reinforces that our business has not been materially affected by trade tensions. Furthermore, our customers and Chinese Government continue to be excited about how Air Products is helping China may meet its goals. They are very supportive. We are successfully executing projects and remain very optimistic about our long term prospect in this region of the ward.For the quarter, sales increased 16% from last year with volume and price together up nearly 20% Volumes increased 16%, driven by new projects, a short-term supply contract and based business growth. As a reminder, Lu'An came fully on its stream during the fourth quarter last year. So the year-on-year benefit was more modest this quarter. Merchant volume was impacted by China's moderating economic growth and some industrial production curtailments in preparation for the country's 70th anniversary celebrations. Overall, pricing for the region increased 3%, the 10th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Price was positive in all key countries.Profit and margins were highest, driven by the strong volume, price and productivity that more than offset negative currency. EBITDA increased 31% and EBITDA margin expanded 550 basis points to over 48%, sequentially, profit growth lack volume growth as we saw higher costs, including plant maintenance and annual value of composition.In terms of projects, we are continuing our discussions with the YK Group for the very large coal to syngas project, and are being told that the project is still expected to proceed, but we do not expect on a stream before 2023.Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to discuss our Americas results. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 22 for a review of our Americas results. Americas strong pricing trend continued, up 3%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. Price was better across all major product lines and in all sub-regions. Overall, sales were down 5%, as higher price was more than offset by 2% lower volume, 5% lower energy pass-through, and 1% weaker currency. Volume was weaker this quarter due to planned Gulf Coast customer outages and continued difficult economic conditions in South America. EBITDA of $412 million increased 3% as strong price overcame the negative impact of lower volume and higher maintenance costs. EBITDA margin of 44% was up 350 basis points. Energy pass-through contributed about 180 basis points.Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 23 for a review of our EMEA results. Our EMEA business overcame the challenging economic conditions in the region and continued to deliver strong results. Price increased 4% with improvement across all major products and sub-regions. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Volume was up 5%, primarily driven by increased demand for hydrogen in our Rotterdam Pipeline System, and our previously announced CO2 business acquisition, while base merchant business volume remained stable.Sales were negatively impacted by 5% lower energy pass-through, 4% unfavorable currency, and 12% from the India contract change. EBITDA of $193 million was up 11%, and was up 16% on a constant currency basis, supported by the strong volume and pricing. EBITDA margin reached almost 40%, an improvement of over 800 basis points. The India contract change and lower energy pass-through contributed about 600 basis points.Now please turn to Slide 24, Global Gases, which includes our air separation unit, sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Our results declined due to lower project activity as we approach the successful conclusion of our Jazan ASU sale of equipment project.Please turn to Slide 25, Corporate segment, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter supported by contributions from the Golden Pass LNG project and lower corporate costs. Although the profit shown in this quarter is still modest, we expect the performance of this segment to improve. We remained optimistic about additional LNG orders since our technology has been selected for several major projects around the world that are awaiting final investment decisions or final agreements with our customers.Now I'm pleased turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. Please turn to Slide #26. As you all know, we continue to live in an uncertain world that we at Air Products cannot control. But we do have control over the actions Air Products can take to succeed in dynamic and changing world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization that remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promises to our investors. Consistent with our goal to achieve an average annual growth rate of at least 10%, we are extremely pleased to provide EPS guidance for fiscal year 2020 of $9.35 to $9.60, up 14% or 17% over our strong fiscal year 2019 performance. This includes our expected contribution from the Jazan project. We expect our fiscal year 2020 capital expenditure to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which includes the expected spending for the Jazan project. For quarter one of fiscal year 2020, our earnings per share guidance is $2.05 to $2.10, up 10% to 15% over last year.Now please turn to Slide #27. At midpoint, our fiscal year 2020 guidance represents six consecutive years of double digit earnings growth and 14% average cumulative earnings growth per share over this six years timeframe. Thanks to the great team of Air Products, we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders 5.5 years ago that we would grow Air Products EPS at least 10% a year. Our team in underworld continues to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products. Our five-point strategic plan will differentiate us and drive our success going forward. Our safety, productivity and operating performance provide the foundation for our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technical position, and knowhow and the challenge and people to take full advantage of the very exciting opportunities ahead of us.And finally, please turn to Slide #28. As always our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our strong performance. I want to thank all our 16,000 people around the world for their commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. I am certainly proud to be part of this winning team.Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Your sequential prices in China were flat. Is there a flattening out of price in that market or is it some kind of pause? What are the price dynamics in China?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas: Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: I would not characterize that as a slowing down of the price increases. In the fourth quarter, in China, there was a very interesting dynamic because a lot of the industries around Beijing, they’re ordered to be shutdown so that there will be clean air for their celebrations on October 1st. Obviously, if that happens, demand goes down and the leverage on pricing goes down. I think that once we get back to normal, which is where we are, that trend will continue.
Jeff Zekauskas: And could you also comment on price trends in Europe and in the United States for 2020 for the industry generally, and there has, obviously, been an industrial slowdown. Is that something that you think would put pressure on industry prices or do you think that -- there is -- or do you think that bonus is not significant enough to deter the underlying trend?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Jeff, that's a very interesting question, because it, obviously, everything depends on the level of activity and then the economic activity, supply demand and all of that. What I can tell you is that in the guidance that we have given you.
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes.
Seifi Ghasemi: We have assumed modest price increases, not significant price increases. So we have been conservative on pricing.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Now the situation turns to be better then we will do better.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you. Can you talk a little more color on the MOUs that both you and the Saudi announced last week and some additional color last night? There is still seemed to be a few constructive moving parts. So just sitting on some of the potentially at least the timing regarding Jazan understanding you can't exclusively quantify as well as the opportunities love to come just, anything you'd like share and that would be a appreciated. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Chris. First of all, can I just comment on Jazan. We are trying to raise more than $7 billion of debt. The banks and our advisors have told us that, look, this cannot done overnight Seifi. It's too optimistic. It's going to take time not only to raise the money at fixed interest rate, but then all of the documentation that is required to actually get to an absolute closing. So we are in the estimate that we have given you we have assumed that this thing will close in the first quarter of calendar 2020, and we have included an appropriate amount of profit in our guidance. Then with respect to the announcement that we made last night, that is pretty significant because that allows us -- that the Royal Commission has approved that Air Products can build facilities and then connect them by a pipeline to serve and optimize all of the requirements of hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in the Jubail area, which I'm sure you're very familiar, is there most of the refineries and chemical plants are. The -- nobody can go and lay a pipeline without the permission of The Royal Commission. So this is going to give us the capability to build a steam methane reformer, new coal gasification in that part of the world, and convey the hydrogen, and then optimize the hydrogen consumption in that part of the world. It can create significant opportunities for investment, but the key, and that is why we’ve made the announcement. The key was having the permission from The Royal Commission to lay the pipeline. We are going to move on this thing very quickly. We have identified a significant number of projects that can be done. The customers in that part of the world are very excited, because, if we do this and build this hydrogen pipeline, the same day that the other hydrogen pipelines in the U.S. Gulf Coast, it gives you the ability to connect these different plants and it significantly increases the reliability of the operation, because you have several production facilities connecting to a pipeline, if one production facility goes down people don't suffer. So this is a very, very positive development for us, and it gives us an ability to actually go and do a lot of these projects. Because if we had built a steam methane reformer or if we had built a gasification unit to gasify petcoke, and all of that, but if we couldn't connect them, it wouldn't have been as interesting. So this is pretty significant, and we are very proud of it and we are very thankful to the Saudi Government to allow us to do this, which is a totally separate project from Jazan. Okay, Chris?
Christopher Parkinson: Yes, that's very helpful. Also in your press release you explicitly called carbon capture, and there's also recently in front of one of the few highlights within your sustainability report, I think it’s like 55 million tons in ‘18 or so. You also hit on a lot of 2020 goals regarding energy, water conservation, et cetera, et cetera. Can you just hit on the opportunity longer term understandably for Air Products on the carbon capture front, again, some of the rhetoric in the U.S, California, Europe, and just how some of these sustainability factors should ultimately help profitability? Just anything to help us conceptualize the longer-term financial opportunity on some of these GST factors would be appreciated? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Chris, thanks for the question. We have always said at Air Products we are focused on energy, which is gasification, huge amount of opportunity there and it is gasification of coal, petcoke, vacuum resid and all of that and you see examples of that. But when you are doing gasification, the CO2 is captured ready. So there is significant opportunity to capture that CO2, and try to really get to a totally clean coal gasification, where you gasify the stuff, you capture the CO2, and therefore, you don't put anything into the atmosphere that. We have the technologies to capture this and use it for and enhance old recovery. We are already doing this in Texas at Port Arthur. We do have technologies to capture this and do sequestration that means injected into the ground, and we have developed technologies and we are enhancing on that and we have done a lot of good work on trying to capture the CO2, and do what is called dry reforming, which means recycle it back and break it back into CO and hydrogen. So these are the projects that we have. Some of these projects are longer-term projects, Chris. They are not going make us an EPS in 2020 or 2021, but definitely they are the future. I believe very strongly that the future is about carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility and gasification. The amount of opportunities that we see, it’s significant, it’s even more than what I talked last quarter or even the quarter before. The whole world is focused on this. We, by buying the Shell and GE technology, are in a totally unique position to provide the gasification technology. We already do have their hydrogen for mobility, and we are the world leader on that as we are developing their carbon capture. So all these put together is going to transform Air Products into a company that is the solving environmental, the urgent environmental issues of the world, and we will be properly rewarded for that. And I think people will be excited about it when we get to '23, '24, '25, when we will be doing a lot of these projects. But we need to start and we are starting right now. And as I said, I can’t point to the fact that we are doing this project and it’s going to give you this much EPS in 2021, but believe me, these things will catch up in time. But the same day that we have started the gasification, five years ago, and now after five years, I have a Jazan project to present you. We are starting on these things, and in time, we will be able to present very exciting projects for our investors.
Operator: And we will take our next question P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.
P.J. Juvekar: So, clinically, given the industrial slowdown, I was trying to figure out what are your volume same-store sales, if you exclude the start – volume from the new project start-ups? Can you talk about your organic volume growth in three regions?
Seifi Ghasemi: Our organic volume growth is nothing to rise home about because the economies in the world are not performing, P.J. I mean we had in the United States of America, everybody is excited and looks at the stock market, and, yeah, it looks pretty good, but the real economy is going nowhere. Industrial production is down. That is what drives our business, same thing in Europe. And then in China, year-over-year -- they are growing at 6.5%, but year-over-year they are not growing. So if you look at our base business, there is no growth. That is why we have tried to transform the company into generating our own growth. If we hadn't done that, we would not be in a position today to sit down and give you a forecast for next year of 17% EPS growth. We would have been swapped and our costs would have gone out and probably would have been negative. That is the issue that most people have. The fact -- so our underlying volumes definitely reflect the state of the economy, which means, relatively it’s going nowhere, no growth in the U.S., no growth in Europe, and China is flat although that is 6.5% growth, but it is flat. So you're absolutely right, our base business is not going anywhere. And if you get dependent on that, we would be in a sad shape right now.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you for that explanation. And then on the Jazan JV, you decided to buy the assets, which makes it capital intensive, but maybe that's how what was needed to make the deal happen. Should we think about this as the model for future projects in China?
Seifi Ghasemi: P.J., by buying air separation unit as part of the whole thing, it will significantly enhance our return, because the return on the air separation unit by itself was less than including it as part of the new acquisition. So we actually did something to enhance our returns on that. In terms of the model, yes, we definitely wherever we are supplying oxygen to a gasifier, we are interested in buying the gasifiers. That is our business model and there are plenty of opportunities for doing that and in time we will appropriately announce projects in that regard.
P.J. Juvekar: I’m sorry, I know about gasifier, I'm just was talking about the power plant and the other ancillary units? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: P.J., the power plant is something unique in Jazan. They usually wouldn't want to be buying power plants. But in Jazan, the only day that Saudi Aramco would agree to part with their assets was that if they had one person to go to, in case they struggle, they didn't want to separate it that we would buy the gasifiers and somebody else would buy them. So that is why the combined forces and we bought the whole thing, but that is not a business model that we want to do around the word. They definitely want to stay with the gasifiers. But there might be unique situations where they have to do that, but we do what is best for in terms of return, and what's best for the shareholders.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: So if we are just looking at 2020, how much will new projects contribute to EPS growth next year versus this year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we obviously don't give that detail because then people figure out productivity of all of our projects. But considering what I was saying with respect to P.J’s question that the world is not going anywhere in terms of economic growth, then you can almost think that any kind of a growth that we get next year is related to pricing and new projects, because a very basic business, and then we have to work hard in productivity to pay for the cost increases.
David Begleiter: Very helpful. And can you just go through merchant pricing by region in the quarter, how much was up?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yeah, merchant pricing was up in the Americas by approximately 8%, in Europe by about 7%, and in Asia by about 7%, for a total of about 7%.
Operator: And our next question will come from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: With regard to the $6 billion to $7 billion that you still have to spend in terms of capital deployment, I guess, how should we be thinking about how that's allocated towards some of the new Saudi opportunities with the MOU that you’re talking about for some of the other opportunities around coal gasification? And I guess, maybe an update us to how the coal gasification project pipeline is looking at this point giving kind of the time -- since we heard last on that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Coal gasification project pipeline is actually looking scarily. There are more opportunities that we can quote honestly, possibly keep up with it. But in terms of giving you a breakdown of the $6 billion or $7 billion or $8 billion or $10 billion that we still have to spend, John, it will be difficult because it depends on which projects come first on all of that. But I definitely can see us significant additional investments in Saudi. I hope significant investments in U.S. because we really do want to invest in the U.S. and we are pursuing some opportunities there. And obviously, opportunities in China, opportunities in Indonesia, and probably significant opportunities in India, because India has finally broken up to the fact that, hey, we should do what the Chinese are doing. Use the coal to gasify and then get ourselves independent of own. So there is going to be – it’s difficult for me to give you an exact breakdown, but it is going to be in areas like Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, China, and hopefully the U.S.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks for the color. And then just maybe a little bit of housekeeping. On the Americas business, how much of that of the volume weakness was tied to kind of the one-offs around outages versus just general macro weakness?
Seifi Ghasemi: Not a lot of it. But it’s the general macro business, and obviously, Latin America.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: If I can just follow up on the – and, well thank you. On the South American volume issue you’ve referenced in the press release. Was that actually worse than you anticipated, and with some of it due to -- some of the civil unrest that's taking place in certain regions down there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the civilian unrest has started after we closed the fiscal year, so that has had, unfortunately, that will have a negative effect in the first quarter, but it's just a general slowdown, Vincent. Things are not that exciting in that part of the world.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And then if I could, yeah, now I understand. And then just on depreciation and amortization for next year given obviously big step up in CapEx, what's around number we should be using for that?
Seifi Ghasemi: I mean, we don't disclose that, but it will be …
Scott Crocco: I would say, Vincent, just in general, that's going to continue to go up as we deploy the capital, recognizing and it’s also going to move around for things like currency as we translated back in the U.S. dollars. We don't give the guidance, but generally speaking as we deploy more capital, we would expect G&A to go up.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Stephen Byrne with Bank of America.
Stephen Byrne: Another one of the Saudi projects that you listed in your press -- in your slide deck is the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle program in Saudi. And just wanted to ask you what you see is really limiting the development of such a program there. You mentioned this pipeline that you're starting to work on is having a hydrogen pipeline and enabling infrastructure for such a development and also just want to ask whether you had any IP associated with such a program.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we do have the IP, and I think that that opportunity is going to be significant because that is one of the reasons that we want to build the pipeline in such a way that you can do a lot of gases -- equivalent of gases stations and connect them to the pipeline, and basically create a hydrogen corridor in that sort of the world and get people excited about driving hydrogen cars. The Saudi Government is very supportive of this. They want to see this happen. And you're right, there are going to be a lot of opportunities. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of numbers and so on, but is – we certainly are in the right path in developing this opportunity in that part of the world, and quite honestly, in other parts of the world.
Stephen Byrne: And Seifi, you mentioned the challenges of raising the $7 billion of debt associated with Jazan, I just wondered if any of that is a fallout of the Saudi Aramco attacks from a couple of months ago. Is that raising any additional hurdles for you?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'd just like to make sure that I explained. We don't see any issues with raising the debt. I said it's an issue of how much time it's going to take. It is one thing you go to the market and you raise the debt, and you get the commitment of the banks. But then after that, you have to come up with a significant amount of documentation in order to get to a closing, and that is going to take time, and obviously you're not going to get any fees until after they have actually legally closed. That's what I was mentioned. But in terms of actually raising the money, I think that the demand is there and the banks are very optimistic that we will get very attractive interest rates.
Operator: And will take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: This is actually Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. I guess first, Seifi, if I look at Slide 13 on margin improvement, there was a big jump up the first two years when you got Air Products and things leveled off for two years or so, and now it seems that taken another material leg up in the past year on margin. So I was hoping you can maybe lay out some of the drivers of this recent move up whether it's cost reduction or the benefits from energy pass-through, and just a 40% plus margin is the new normal fair products going forward.
Seifi Ghasemi: The first jump that you saw was obviously all of the productivity and the $400 million, $500 million of costs that we took out of the system, so that happened. And then, obviously, it was constant because these are working on the growth projects. And now, what is happening is that all of these things we were talking about are actually coming to fruition, we had Lu'An running, we're going to have Jazan running, we have a lot of other projects running and those projects that we have now signed up are actually pretty profitable projects. And that is now reflecting on the results. So we jumped because we had the productivity, we were focused on that, then it took us upon to get the growth opportunities lined up, and now we are seeing the benefit of that. Now whether our EBITDA margins for the long-term are at around 38% or 39% or 40% or 41%, depends on the projects, but I think, I feel pretty good that they will stay in the high 30s, and rather than being 32% or 33%, they will be 38%, 39%, 40%.
Mike Leithead: Got it. That's really helpful. And then following up on the Jazan project, I appreciate that you not going to provide detailed financial details. But when you look at the earnings contribution internally that you would expect today versus maybe when you announced the project back in last August, are the project economics, or is the IRR, better today than they originally looked when you announced the JV or roughly the same?
Seifi Ghasemi: They're better. And I mean, I say I'm not going to give any detailed numbers, because obviously our customers don't want us to do that. But, at the same time, we are giving you the guidance that, look, we have always told you that for every dollars of cash, we get you that we put out to get some percent operating profit. So it's not too difficult to activity figure out, and we’re saying this is better than that. So you can get to a pretty good estimate about what this thing will do for us.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna.
Don Carson: Want to talk – I know you talked about creating your own growth because obviously this is not much going on in the industrial economy these days. So, last year, I think onsite in pipeline was 52% of sales, where did you come out in '19? And by the time you make all these additional capital commitments in new projects by '23, where do you see the mix of onsite business going versus where is now?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, my goal is in time for that to get to 70%, 75% of our sales. But right now, obviously, once Jazan comes on the stream, it will be better than where we are, and all of these other projects. So our goal is to significantly increase our onsite business because that brings a lot more stability in terms of our earnings.
Scott Crocco: Yeah, Don, if I could -- I think absolutely, over the long run, as Seifi said and in reality, we are increasing our onsite business. Just remember one new launch for '19 will be because we change the India contract that will reduce that revenue, but that doesn't really change the fundamental concept of our onsite business is increasing.
Don Carson: And just as a follow-up on gasification. Obviously, Jazan has driven by IMO, and they need to do something else with the backend residuals. What's the pipeline for other similar opportunities in the refining sector?
Seifi Ghasemi: Significant. We have always said that this and it goes -- everything refinery in the world has to face this situation because there is – what do the refineries do. If there is a new refinery, they obviously have to figure out what did they do for their bottom of the barrel. We eager not to gasify and then some people said that it is [indiscernible] most of the refineries have a [indiscernible]. But the [indiscernible] produces 6.5% sulfur coke, which right now is being banned in India. China is turning the ships away because they say this is not the product, this is the waste. So every single refinery in the world in time has to figure out what the hell they're going to do with their 6.5% petcoke. And the only viable solution for that is to gasify. That is why we were so excited about making sure we buy the GE technology because that is very much about that. I don't think that five years from any refinery will be able to sell their petcoke. They just won't be able to do that, and therefore, they have to gasify. So I think the opportunity is significant. And we are quite honestly seeing that.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: On Slide 32, you’re essentially doubling your capital expenditure budget for 2020. And so I was wondering if you could disaggregate some of the major buckets in terms of Jazan? How much have you earmarked for that in the year relative to other growth projects and maintenance that you anticipate?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that our maintenance CapEx, as Scott already disclosed that, it's about $400 million. And then with the Jazan, I don't want to disclose the details of what we expect, but the total cash outlay is $2.5 billion, and probably a significant part of it will happen in 2020 depending on when we actually close the transaction. And then the rest of it is our growth CapEx, which is pretty robust. Our fundamental -- if you exclude Jazan, our expenditure on other projects, is actually pretty good and we are very optimistic about that. It's around more than – yeah, it's around $2.5 billion. Yeah.
Kevin McCarthy: And sticking with the subject of capital deployment, Seifi, I think you’ve indicated that the project pipeline looks quite robust. What are you seeing these days in the M&A pipeline? Is there anything of interest that could be brewing on that front?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, M&A pipeline in terms of us actually buying another industrial gas company around the world, I don't see a lot of debt. But Jazan $12 billion is really an M&A. I mean we are buying these existing assets, so it depends how you want to categorize that. But in terms of buying other industrial gas companies, I don't see much of an opportunity, mainly because of anti-trusting.
Operator: And our next question will be from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
Jim Sheehan: What's the rationale for the Qudra JV? Why not just own this business outright?
Seifi Ghasemi: It's because that – okay, we plan to do a lot more with ACWA Qudra, so called what we call APQ. Then just the Jazan project. Qudra Energy is part of Aqua Power and people who own that. We have had a very successful joint venture with them. The people are very competent. And we plan to do a lot -- the reason that we have formed that entity is to do a lot more than just Jazan. They are going to be involved before I’ve talked about the Jazan, the hydrogen pipeline that we're going to build, and other projects in Saudi Arabia, and quite honestly other projects in the Middle East. So the rationale for that is a lot bigger than just for Jazan. Therefore, since we have that kind of a relationship with them, we wanted them to be a little bit part of Jazan project to get things started.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you. And regarding your comments on carbon capture, you demonstrated the ability to capture CO2 in your steam methane reformers, in Texas, several years ago. It was a $400 million pilot project, and I think a majority of the project cost recovered by the Department of Energy grant. Are you expecting the federal government to give you more grant money or you’re planning to find it yourself? And also if you could discuss, how much are refinery customers willing to pay for your ability to capture CO2?
Seifi Ghasemi: On that front, these things are happening the way they are happening is, obviously, as you know there is a federal program that for every ton of CO2 that you capture, you can get up to $45 -- $45 or something like that. But then, take a look at what California is doing which I think is going to be the trend worldwide. And that is that, right now, in California, if you capture a ton of CO2, and you can see sequestrate and demonstrate that it wouldn’t leach for 100 years; you get $200 a ton bonus. So we think that the trend will be that difference states will do the same thing, and we are seeing that the same kind of thing is happening in terms of incentives by other governments. We are right now involved in a project for sequestrating CO2 in Europe, actually in the port rather than building your pipeline in order to put the CO2 there and sequestrate. So all of these things are going to be driven, we think, by a pretty substantially incentives from the different governments in order to encourage carbon capture, which is obviously a big issue global.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Thanks. Congrats on a nice quarter and good outlook guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John. I appreciate that.
John Roberts: Seifi, you mentioned India waking up to their coal opportunity. How far away are we from something parallel to your China projects? Is it two or three or five years away for having something big in India?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think that India -- with these projects when the government decides, okay, we're going to do this thing, obviously, you have to identify opportunities, put the project together, do feasibility study and so on. So I think it’s -- from today it’s a five or six years process before you get to equivalent of land or equivalent of Jazan and so on. So that's kind of the timeframe that I see. But quite honestly, same thing we have started something five years ago, we see the benefit of it, if you have started now we see the benefit of it in time, but it will be about, I think, a five year process before you actually have gasification units operating in India. The same thing that happened John within China. China decided to go with gasification in around 2005, 2006, and the units didn't start coming on the scene until about 2011, 2012. Okay?
Operator: And will take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Don [indiscernible] on Bob. I'd say I had to jump on in that with I’ll just start. You owned that GE and Shell technology. Is there an opportunity to get -- to go into, I guess, dozens of operating gasifiers within China, so using that technology and trying to be gasify those assets?
Seifi Ghasemi: That's exactly what we are trying to do. That is an opportunity. I don't know in how many of them will be succeed, but that is exactly what you're trying to do.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then, I guess, sense maybe the technology has evolved, and we're seeing opportunities, I guess, operate those more efficiently?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.
Jonas Oxgaard: Looking at the hydrogen, you talked a little bit about outages of your customers. I was wondering if you could give us a range for how much that depressed yourselves. And then on the flip side, as far as you can tell every refiner we've heard has said that they are prepping for IMO, and so there's going to be no outages next year. Is that a material uplift for your volumes next year?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, if that materializes, obviously, it will be, but these refineries are on a cycle that they have to do their shutdown, and some of them will take a shutdown before years and all of that. This is something which is very difficult to predict in terms of how it works out. Obviously, in our plan, we have allowed for some shutdowns, if they don't happen that will be an upside. But I fully expect them to happen and the shutdowns are pretty big deals and the refineries have to do that, otherwise, they take a risk in operation, which they would – that would have unplanned shutdown, which is not good for anybody.
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay. And it looks -- it looks like you pushed the [indiscernible] project out about a year, is that right? And if so why?
Seifi Ghasemi: It is the same thing that we have said before. There are a lot of issues about the so called coal allocation in terms of allocating coal to this project, which we would like to see it done. And as a result, we want to be up upfront the investors about the fact that we announced the memorandum of understanding about something that we thought was going to happen because it was signed with a lot of fanfare and in front of two Presidents and all of that. But there is internal struggle about getting coal allocated to this project. So we pushed it a year, but we are going to give you an update every quarter about this thing, but obviously we are not too excited about the development, as I'm sure, you're not.
Jonas Oxgaard: Maybe just – want Scott just to make it clumsy.
Scott Crocco: Yeah, and, obviously, Seifi's comments are really referring to the overall project that [indiscernible] is doing. This isn't an issue where the customers proceeding and we have some problem in our project, that's not the situation.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to ask about the global gases and the corporate segments. Curious what drove the results there to be so much better in Q4 than they were in the other quarters of fiscal '19? And could you possibly give us some guidance for what we should expect in fiscal '20 versus fiscal '19?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, on that front, the main drivers, I think, Simon is the expert on the corporate sector, but, yes, I think is sure of these things. Simon why don't you comment?
Simon Moore: Sure. It's a great question Mike. Thanks. I mean, obviously, as we said for few quarters now, we are excited about the LNG business, and we've announced one order and we believe there we're in good position for others. So that's been a key factor. But I'd also say that, certainly, the corporate sector there were a couple of kind of one-time items. So that's a profit recognition on a sale of equipment is lumpy. So there might be a little bit lumpy going forward, but certainly over the next couple of years, we expect nice improvements in the LNG business.
Mike Harrison: All right. And then other question I had was on the acquisition -- the CO2 acquisition in Europe in the Jinmei asset buyback. Can you breakout what the contribution to revenue was either on a full company basis or in the Europe gases and Asia gases region?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it’s just small, because they have just started. So we don't give that kind of detail, but it was not significant. It will be better next year, but it was not significant for the quarter.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: I just have two very quick ones. First on the Q-45, is your impression that is the IRS does make a clear ruling on implementation we should expect their products to be able to do flurry of announcements in the near-term or will there be a multiyear lag for projects to be developed? And secondly, given the way you're describing the long-term opportunity set, so the eyeball related opportunity there gasification, the coal gasification and a carbon sequestration, if negative rates continue, how long or is there a point at which merchant ask becomes non-core sale products?
Seifi Ghasemi: Let me answer the second question. Merchant gas will never become non-core. That is an integral part of our business. And no matter how many opportunities there are, we are still focused on that, and that business is growing in China and all of that. So the merchant business locks in all I mean, helium, liquid hydrogen, they are all -- that would always be a core part of our products. But on your first part of the question, I'd like to turn it over to Scott to answer.
Scott Crocco: How but just want to clearly, Laurence, with your question regarding CO2, and the tax situation on it.
Laurence Alexander: Correct. So the IRS ruling on Q-45 that's been delayed, the question is if they do clarify, what the rule is, should we expect what sort of announcement near-term or is it going to take several years to line up agreements?
Scott Crocco: Well, I guess, maybe I think – Laurence, I think, one thing that Seifi talked about was he talked about a number of local state or provincial programs in various places around the world that also are very supportive of CO2 capture projects. So I think the reality is there's a lot of different situations that we’ll have to see play out, but as Seifi said, we're very excited about this.
Seifi Ghasemi: It's very difficult to predict what will happen without the legislations and so on. But there are a lot of programs, which are in place, and I think that will continue to be the case as we move forward.Okay. I think that was the last question. And with that, I would like to thank everyone for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We obviously appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day, and Happy Thanksgiving and Merry Christmas. And let's all see you in January, and some of you maybe even sooner. All the best. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-07-25 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals third quarter earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved.Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Simon Moore: Thank you Eduardo. Good morning everyone. Welcome to Air Products third quarter 2019 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO, Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions.Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two.Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Simon, and good morning to everyone. We certainly do appreciate your interest in Air Products, and we thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to join us on this call. At Air Products, we have a great team of talented, committed, and motivated people who stay focused on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders every single day. This team delivered yet another quarter of very strong results. I want to thank all of our 16,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.Our quarterly adjusted earnings per share is a record $2.17 per share, 11% higher than the last year and 14% higher at constant exchange rates. This is the 21st, I would like to repeat, 21st consecutive quarter that we have reported higher results compared to the previous year. We continue to maintain our position as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world.Our EBITDA margin this quarter was a record 40%, which is 1,500 basis points higher than five years ago. We remain in an extremely strong financial and technology position with a business that generates significant cash flow. Each quarter, my confidence increases in our ability to deploy this capital into high-return industrial gas projects that will generate significant value for our shareholders while also continuing to return cash to our shareholders through our dividends.Now, please turn to slide number three. In terms of safety, our goal has always been zero accidents and zero incidents. We are pleased that we have improved our lost time injury rate by 72% and our recordable injury rate by 31% since 2014. But none of us can be satisfied until and unless we reach zero accidents. Even one accident is too many.Now please turn to slide number four that states our long-term goal. Five years ago, we set the goal to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We are very proud of achieving this goal and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the years to come. Our goal has also been extended to include being the most diverse. That means we are an inclusive company that we welcome the contribution of all people.Now turn to slide number five, which is my management philosophy that has guided me throughout my business career, that is focus on cash generation and responsible capital allocation.Now please turn to slide number six, which is our five-point plan for moving forward. We have shared this with you many times before. In summary, we are focused on cost and productivity to maintain our industry-leading margins. We are poised for growth by expanding on our core competencies and financial strength, and we are very focused on promoting a higher purpose for the company in addition to creating value for the shareholders. We are committed to create a company where all the people feel they belong, a company where people's contribution are recognized and rewarded, a company that is committed to sustainability and environment, a company that is supportive of the communities in which we operate, a company that people want to work for where they are proud to be part of the innovative process to solve diverse energy and environmental challenges. That is our higher purpose and we are committed to that.Now please turn to slide number seven, which shows the key milestones in our gasification strategy. Let's take the opportunity to provide an update on a few of these exciting projects. As expected, the Lu'An project continues to run very well and contribute to our results. The Jazan air separation unit got built on budget and on time with excellent safety performance. We continue to work toward financial closing of the Jazan gasifier and power project by the end of this calendar year. We are continuing our discussion with the YK Group for the very large coal to syngas project. And the Juitai project is going with expected on-stream in 2022. Building on this momentum, we just announced the completion of an asset buyback arrangement with Jinmei, a leading coal chemical company in China. We purchased two ASUs previously owned by Jinmei and entered into a long-term contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen for the customers' coal-to-clean fuel project in Shanxi province. This project is another great example of the customers' increased confidence in outsourcing their industrial gases. In addition to these announced projects, we continue to work on a number of existing gasification opportunities around the world.Now please go to slide number eight, where you can see the results of our key profitability metrics. We remain committed to our goal of continuing to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these metrics.And now please go to slide number nine, which is always my favorite slide and even more so this quarter. You can see our record quarterly EBITDA margin of 40.1%, up 1,500 basis points from five years ago. This is a tremendous achievement by the people of Air Products, and all of us are very proud of it.Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much Seifi. Now please turn to slide 10 for a summary of our third quarter results. As Seifi said, our business continues to perform very well. Price was up 4%, with strong performance across the regions and products continuing the positive trend we saw last quarter. Volume added another 2%, primarily driven by new plants, including Lu'An. Sales of $2.2 billion were down 2% as the positive volume and price were more than offset by 4% negative currency and a 3% impact from a contract modification. As I mentioned on past calls, this India contract modification reduces sales but has no impact on our profits. Our underlying volume was positive but was partially offset by lower sales from the Jazan sales of equipment project as that project nears completion and from a prior year contract termination for an old fluegas desulfurization plant. Excluding Jazan, volumes grew 4% due to new plants, base business growth and acquisitions. We continue to see strong pricing in all three regions and across our merchant product lines. Our team has worked very hard to realize the value we provide to our customers and I want to thank the team for a job well done. Although unfavorable currency persisted, both EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share reached new highs. EBITDA of $892 million improved 9% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 was 11% higher. EBITDA margin of over 40% is another record high up, almost 400 basis points compared to prior year, primarily from the higher price and the India contract modification. ROCE of 12.7% improved 50 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher profits. Sequentially, EBITDA increased 8% as all three regions improved, particularly in Asia following Lunar New Year in Q2.Please turn to slide 11. Our third quarter GAAP EPS was $2.20 and includes three one-time items which totaled a positive $0.03 per share impact. You can find more details in our press release and appendix slide. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $2.17 was up 11% or $0.22 per share. Volume, price and costs together contributed $0.24 repeating the strong operating performance from last quarter. As a reminder, the impact of price increases is shown net of the impact of variable costs, primarily variable production costs, such as power and distribution costs in our merchant business. The other cost line refers to fixed cost, such as personnel and plant maintenance costs. It increased slightly this quarter versus prior year but is less of a headwind than recent quarters. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.05 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and the Euro. Excluding the unfavorable currency, EPS increased $0.27 or 14% over last year. Non-operating items, including tax rate and non-operating income, combined added $0.03. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%. For the full fiscal year 2019, we expect an effective tax rate of between 19% and 20%.Now please turn to slide 12. We continue to generate strong cash flow. During the last 12 months, we generated about $11.50 per share or over $2.5 billion of distributable cash flow. From this distributable cash flow, we paid almost $1 billion or about 40% as dividends to our shareholders and still have nearly $1.6 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business. This strong cash flow enables us to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.Slide number 13 provides an update on our capital deployment progress. As you can see, we now show almost $17 billion of investment capacity available over the five-year period from FY 2018 through FY 2022. As expected, the total capacity continues to grow as we increase EBITDA. The almost $17 billion includes about $9 billion of additional debt capacity available today, over $5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY 2022 and almost $3 billion already spent. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. Today, we have a total of about $7.7 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $6.7 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent 15% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity.Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Scott. Please turn to our Asia results on slide number 14. There you can see that our business has recovered strongly following the Lunar New Year holiday and our great team in Asia delivered yet another strong set of results. We remain very positive and I like to stress very positive about our long-term growth potential as we continue to invest in this region. While there has been some modest reduction in the reported growth rate of Chinese economy, we have not seen, as I said, we have not seen any significant impact on our business. And most importantly, we have not seen any change in behavior towards Air Products from our customers or the government of China. We continue to be very optimistic about our operations in China.For the quarter, sales were up 9% from last year with volume and price together up 15%. Volumes increased 10%, primarily driven by new projects, mostly Lu'An. As a reminder, Lu'An has started up late in quarter three of last year and continues to perform very well. Overall pricing for the region was up 5% versus last year, the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year price improvement. Price was positive across all major product lines and key countries. The strong volume and price, combined with productivity, drove higher profits and margins. EBITDA increased 24% and EBITDA margin expanded nearly 600 basis points to more than 49%, which is another record level. Sequentially, volume and EBITDA improved 8% and 12% respectively, benefiting from a strong recovery from the Lunar New Year holidays and new plant startups. In addition to the asset buyback I mentioned earlier, we have recently announced two contract awards in Korea. One from MEMC to provide industrial gases for its new 300 millimeter wafer fab and other from POSCO Chemical to supply oxygen and nitrogen for its new cathode material manufacturing complex. A great example of our team earning the confidence of important customers.Now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas results. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you Seifi. Please turn to slide 15 for a review of Americas results. Americas pricing success continues. The 4% improvement represents our best performance in at least four years. Overall, sales were up 1% as higher price was partially offset by 1% lower energy pass-through and 2% unfavorable currency impact. Underlying volumes grew 1% but were offset by the prior year contract termination I mentioned previously. Record EBITDA of $410 million increased 7% and EBITDA margin of 43% was up 270 basis points, primarily driven by higher pricing. Sequentially, EBITDA margin improved 270 basis points or 100 basis points excluding the impact of lower energy pass-through.Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you Scott. Please turn to slide 16 for a review of our EMEA results. We continue to show positive operational results despite limited economic growth. Price increased 4%, with improvement across all major products and subregions. The EMEA team has now delivered six consecutive quarters of year-on-year price improvement. Volume was up 2% primarily driven by the acquisition of a CO2 producer while base business volume remained stable as positive retail volumes were offset by lower wholesale volume sales. Sales were negatively impacted by 2% lower energy pass-through, 5% unfavorable currency and an 11% sales reduction due to the India contract change that Scott mentioned. Reported EBITDA of $190 million was up 2% and was up 7% on a constant currency basis. Reported EBITDA margin improved 520 basis points to reach a new high of over 38%. Excluding the India contract change, EBITDA margin was up about 100 basis points. Sequentially, volumes were higher on better merchant volume, including the acquisition. And although we continue to see Brexit as a potential risk to our future results, at this point we have not seen any significant negative impacts.Now please turn to slide 17, global gases, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and EBITDA declined due to lower project activity as we approach the successful conclusion of our Jazan ASU sale of equipment project.Please turn to slide 18, corporate segment which includes LNG and our other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Although modest, it is great to finally see improvement in this segment with the best sales and profits in almost three years. The Golden Pass LNG project in the U.S. Gulf Coast began to contribute this quarter and we are optimistic about additional LNG orders. It is important to note that our LNG technology has been selected for several North America and international projects that are awaiting final investment decisions by our customers.Now, I am pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Simon. Please turn to slide number 19. As I said on our last call, five years ago I promised we would grow the company's earnings per share by at least 10% annually. As you can see, we have done better than that over the last four years and expect to exceed 10% again this year. Thanks to the great team at air products, we have delivered on our commitments. Our goal continues to be achieving a cumulative average growth rate of at least 10% in the coming years. As you all know, we continue to live in an uncertain world that we at Air Products cannot control but we definitely do have control over the actions Air products can take to succeed in a dynamic world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization that remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promise to investors to increase earning per share by 10% per year as we move forward.Now please turn to slide number 20. Our updated EPS guidance for fiscal year 2019 is in the range of $8.20 to $8.25. Despite currency headwinds, this guidance represents 10% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance. For quarter four of fiscal year 2019, our earnings per share guidance is $2.26 to $2.31, up 13% to 16% over last year. Our team around the world continues to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products. Our five point strategic plan will differentiate us and drive our success going forward. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation of our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technical position and the talent to take full advantage of our existing opportunities.And finally, please turn to slide number 21. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance. I want to again thank all of our 16,000 people around the world for their commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together. I certainly am proud to be part of this winning team.Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Seifi, good pricing in the quarter. I think this was, by far, one of your best pricing quarters ever. Your onsite pricing is kind of set contractually. So, I assume that merchant prices are up a lot more than what you reported here. Can you talk about what's going on there? Is it driven by utilization? And what are you seeing from competitors? Are you seeing more disciplined behavior from competitors? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning P.J. You are very right. When we report our results, we report over the whole sector including the onsite business. Obviously, the onsite business, that prices are not going up and that's half of our business. So, when we report 4% price increase, it really is about 8% or 9%. What is driving the pricing is our decision to increase prices because it's about almost eight years that we haven't really increased prices. Our costs are going up. I made a very, very public statement in February of this year that we at Air Products have decided to increase our prices to recover our costs, and we are willing to lose volume if people want to buy from somebody else. And obviously that's a free choice they have. We consciously have decided that we need to maintain our margins and we are increasing the prices. I certainly cannot and will not comment on the behavior of the other people. I mean that's up to them to comment when you ask them the question. But we certainly have made a conscious decision despite utilization rate or anything like that that we need higher prices to maintain our margins. We can't let our margins go down.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And then just quickly, there is U.S.-China trade war going and I know you are not directly impacted, but your customers are. And so, can you talk about what end markets where you are seeing that impact of the trade war and which markets are strong for you?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, P.J., quite frankly, we do not see that. Now maybe it is because in China, for example, more than 60% of our business is onsite business. And therefore as a result, you know, we have a lot of protection there. But overall, I mean, I know the headline says that China is slowing, but then the next line it says China grew 6.32%. I mean if that was the case in the U.S., we will be doing cartwheels. So, the Chinese economy is growing and we are seeing the benefit of that.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our next question from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you very much. Do you think that Yima oxygen explosion in China will affect project activity at all in China?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I don't think so, because I think once people investigate, they find out what the cause is and I don't want to speculate, but I don't think that is an indication of any fundamental issue with respect to processes and so on. From what we understand, the explosion was at the ASU, not at the gasification unit. No, I don't expect any impact, not at all, John.
John Roberts: Then how much was volume up in the U.S., because I assume it was probably down in Latin America at least a little, and I don't really know what Mexico did? Actually, that's equity income, so I think that probably doesn't show up in your numbers.
Seifi Ghasemi: Our volumes in Americas was up about 4% in total.
John Roberts: 4%.
Seifi Ghasemi: Am I quoting the right number?
Simon Moore: So, I think what we said on the call was our underlying volumes were up 1% in the Americas offset by the prior-year contract termination.
John Roberts: Right. No, I was asking U.S. versus Latin America or North versus South?
Seifi Ghasemi: We don't usually break that down, but the economy in the U.S. is not growing that much. It's flat.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bob Koort: Thanks. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Bob Koort: I wanted to explore your Jinmei project, is that just the fruition of something that I think you guys had worked a couple years ago on buying back those ASUs and supplying the gasifiers. Is that the same project and now it's just getting formalized and completed?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is correct. You are absolutely right. We have been working on this project for a while, and it finally came to fruition and we are announcing it.
Bob Koort: So, I noticed you say you are going to supply by pipeline, and I think there is, I guess, a conventional view that these coal projects must be out in the middle of nowhere. So, if you are supplying by pipeline, does that mean you are utilizing other assets in the area to supply?
Seifi Ghasemi: No John. Our plant is next to their plant. It just is delivered within a pipe. That means we are not delivering liquid, but it is from our facility.
Bob Koort: Got you. And then Jinmei is massive. Does this portend future opportunities there? Could you do as you have done with Jazan and others and eventually convert this into some potential gasification opportunity as well from an investment standpoint?
Seifi Ghasemi: Bob, obviously, that would be our ambition, yes.
Bob Koort: And if I might sneak a last one in. In Jazan, have you guys finalized your ownership structure there? The percentages?
Seifi Ghasemi: In Jazan, I think we have said that we will end up owning about 51%. But we are finalizing the contract. The numbers might change it, 1% up and down, but nothing massive, no. We will did end up owning the majority there.
Bob Koort: Great. Thank you Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: All right. We will take our next question from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Seifi, you have certainly affected a significant culture change at Air Products and just wanted to get your view on where you are at right now with respect to that process? Is there more to go on structural change? Or is it primarily, at this point, that you incentivized employees to come forward with new opportunities for improvement?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, thank you for your question. You know, obviously, I am very proud of what we have achieved but at the same time, you know with a culture change you are never done. We can always, always, always do better. But I am very, very satisfied with the progress we have made. Our results show that. And in terms of the future, I think our people are very excited about the growth opportunities that we have. And as a result, you know, we are a lot more productive. People are excited about coming to work. People are excited about working on very exciting and new projects. And we are hiring people. So that always creates a positive mood within the company. We always work on productivity but we are hiring people for our new projects and all of that. So I feel very good about the organization. We have a great team of people. But at the same time, we can always do better.
Stephen Byrne: And on gasification, you mentioned Seifi that you are still working on numerous opportunities. Just curious as to whether or not you are seeing the bidding activity increase or get more competitive, particularly since your margins in Asia have really escalated with Lu'An?
Seifi Ghasemi: We are seeing very good opportunities. We are working on new project. And in terms of the bidding activity, quite honestly we are not in a good position to answer because our customers don't necessarily tell us whom we are competing bid and how many other bidders and all of that. But overall, you know who our competitors are. There are really three people who can participate on these big projects. There are not 20. So out of the three of us, we are all focused on different parts of the world and whether all the other two are in every project that we are in, I don't know. But when we approach a customer, we try to do the best we can for them and for Air Products. And fortunately, we are fortunate, we see a lot of opportunities and I expect us to get additional orders as we move forward.
Stephen Byrne: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Seifi, if we can go to your favorite slide nine, you were in that band of 34% to 36% for basically 2016, 2017 and 2018. Now in the last two quarters, you have kind of broken out of that band to a much higher range. Is the last two quarters indicative of where you think the new range will be over the next several years? Or are the last two quarters more of an anomaly and will trend back towards that 34% to 36% over time?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning Duffy. You always ask me difficult questions, but that's fair. We have been guiding you that the margins are going to be around 33% to 35%. Right now, we have delivered around 40%, 37%, 40%. So right now, if I was going to make a prediction for the future, we are going to be in a higher band. You are going to be somewhere between 38% to 40%. That is correct Duffy.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks. And as long as we are predicting in the future, could you give us an early peak what 2020 looks like for you guys? And maybe not business conditions, because they can change but just when you look at the projects that you have got feathered in for 2020, is that supportive of the 10% plus growth rate you are trying to get in EPS?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I said in the call twice that our goal is to improve our profitability by 10%. So I think that kind of answers your question, right. That is what we said, yes.
Duffy Fischer: Perfect. Thank you guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: All right. We will not take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Well, what was your Asia volume growth, ex Lu'An?
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Including Lu'An, it was about maybe 4%.
Jeff Zekauskas: About 4%, okay. And prices in the United States or prices in North America and Europe have been very good year-over-year, but pricing in Europe and in the Americas was flat sequentially and capacity utilization rates in North America and Europe have flattened out and come off. So generally speaking, has pricing in industrial gases as a base case plateaued at the current levels that we are at?
Seifi Ghasemi: I wouldn't want to say that. I expect continued price improvement at least in the next two quarters. And then after that we will see how it works out. But I think the momentum that we have will continue in the next two quarters, Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead, sir.
Don Carson: Yes. Thank you. Good morning Seifi. You have been delivering strong earnings growth despite the drag from LNG. So can you remind us has that drag on earnings been in the last few years? And as your project backlog starts to improve, what sort of contribution could you see sale of the LNG equipment making over the next few years?
Seifi Ghasemi: Don, that's an excellent question. In 2015, our LNG business delivered us about $0.50 earnings per share, about $150 million of EBITDA. Last year and this year, it almost contributed nothing. So the drag has been about $0.50. So I am hoping that in time we will recover that and hopefully even improve on that.
Don Carson: Okay. And then a follow-up on your EPS contribution. You had 4% volume growth if you exclude Jazan but you show that as a $0.04 drag on EPS year-over-year. So I am trying to reconcile why volume improvement would be an EPS drag?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think Scott in the best position to answer this. Scott, please.
Scott Crocco: Sure. Hi Don, thanks for the question. I think I mentioned this in my prepared remarks. So importantly, when we look at the underlying volumes up modestly and the contribution from those volumes were good, there were a couple of things in there that I will refer to as kind of a negative mix impact, which is the timing for the Jazan project, which as we call it the sale of equipment. So the timing on revenues versus profit, year-on-year is throwing that off a little bit as well as the prior year contract termination that I mentioned in Americas. So that's why you see the difference between the EPS contribution versus the sales. But again importantly, when you peel those kind of one-off things out, the underlying volumes were up and the contribution from those volumes were positive.
Don Carson: Thank you.
Operator: All right. We will take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning David. How are you?
David Begleiter: Well. Thank you. Just on Jazan, as we are closer to 2020, can you talk about the cadence of the earnings ramp from the JV into 2020 and 2021 earnings, either pretax basis or an EPS basis?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, David, you know, first of all, we are working on that thing and we are hoping that everything will work out and we do the financing and signing. So I just want to say, it is not a done deal yet. But if it is done, what we have said publicly is that considering what we are investing, we will see a contribution about more than $0.75 from that project when it comes on-stream. Now, once we actually get the contract signed, put all of the numbers together and all of that and we make the final announcement that this has been done, hopefully before the end of this calendar year, then we will give you better guidance in terms of the impact on 2020 and 2021 and moving forward.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on merchant pricing, Seifi, what was the merchant price gain by region that you realized in the quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: I would like to read the numbers. Merchant pricing was 9%, 6%, 14% and 9% total.
Scott Crocco: Yes. That was Americas, Europe and Asia in that order.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: All right. We will now take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you. So just when you are looking at the setup overall for fiscal year 2020, there are obviously a few base moving parts. Business growth, which obviously can go with the macro. Your project in Saudi Arabia, very smaller backlog projects and the initial ramp of some LNG wins. I understand if you can't quantify these buckets, but can you just comment on your confidence in terms of the line of sight that you see into these and just your general level of enthusiasm opportunity each? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Chris. I can say that I am very optimistic that we will deliver a 10% improvement over 2019. Now if the number is going to be any better, we will talk to you about that in October. But right now, sitting here, looking at what is happening in the world, we think that we should be able to improve our EPS next year by 10% versus this year. And the way we look at it is that, you know, our job, I get paid $15 million a year to come and deliver results rather than come and explain why I didn't deliver result. We are committed to improve our EPS 10% a year in the years to come. We have done that. We will find different levers to pull in order to make that happen whether it is cost reduction, price increases, new projects and all of that. So that is our commitment to the investors, that has been our commitment to the investors since five years ago and we hope to continue to deliver that, Chris.
Christopher Parkinson: Fair enough. In new materials, you have been consistently referencing an additional $6.7 billion remaining capital to deploy and you have made it very clear that you will only explore projects that are in excess of 10% returns. When you just look at the remaining backlog opportunities, which it's my understanding there is still ample, can you just comment, are the returns mostly close to that 10% level? Or is it fair to say that there is still plenty in there that would be more similar to the implied of return of Lu'An? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, you know it's very difficult to predict that, but we have said that we would be very hesitant to take any project that's less than 10% return. So hopefully all of these projects will be 10% or higher.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Chris.
Operator: All right. We will take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jonas Oxgaard: Good morning guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi.
Jonas Oxgaard: You talked, well, you talked quite some time about expanding your onsite as a percentage of your total. But considering the success in your merchant business now, are you revisiting that strategy at all?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, because we are -- our merchant business, we are going to grow it as fast as we can. We are not downsizing that. But we think that our onsite will grow faster than that. So our ratio will change not because we are slowing down on the merchant business but because we think the onsite business has the potential of growing faster than the merchant.
Jonas Oxgaard: So you don't see an opportunity to double down on the merchant either?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the merchant business, we are going to double down based on economic growth. In China, it's growing 6%. We did build new merchant plants. But if you have a situation in Europe or in the U.S. where the market is not growing then obviously we are not going to add capacity. But that we are committed to our merchant business. We will grow it as fast as we can grow it, which is basically GDP. Nobody can grow their merchant business faster than GDP. I don't care what they say. Because if they say, oh, we are going to grow faster than the other guy, that means they are going to take market share away from the other guy and that doesn't happen. Nobody can take away market share from us and vice versa. So the merchant business is going to grow with the GDP of each region and as it grows, we will invest in that. We are committed to that. We have the know-how. We have the people. But my point is that that growth is in emerging markets. It is not in the U.S. and it is not in Europe, okay.
Jonas Oxgaard: Okay. That makes sense.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions].
Seifi Ghasemi: We have time for one more question, please.
Operator: This is our last question. Please go ahead.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well it that doesn't seem that there is any other questions. So with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We do appreciate your interest and good questions and look forward to discussing another set of good results with you again next quarter. Have a nice summer holiday and all the best. Take care.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-04-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products and Chemicals Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products second quarter 2019 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on Slide Number 2. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate your interest in Air Products and thank you for joining us on our call today. At Air Products, we have a talented, committed and motivated team who stays focused on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders every day of the year. This team delivered yet another quarter of very strong safety and financial results. I want to thank all of our 16,000 employees for their hard work, dedication and contribution. Our quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 is up 12% and represents the 20th consecutive quarter, I like to stress that, the 20th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year quarterly EPS growth. This strong result overcame a negative $0.08 currency impact. Our EPS is up 17% on a constant currency basis. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with a record quarterly dividend margin above 37%. We remain in a very strong financial and technological position with a business that generates significant cash flow. I remain extremely confident of our ability to deploy this capital into high return industrial gas projects that does generate significant value for our shareholders, while also continuing to return cash through our dividend. Now, please turn to Slide Number 3. All our employees around the world are focused on safety. And as a result, we have improved our loss time injury rate by 83% and our recordable injury rate by 45% since 2014. Slide number 4 states our long standing goal. Five years ago, we set the goal be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. I am very happy and proud to say that we have achieved this goal and are committed to maintaining our position in the years to come. We expanded the goal to include being the most diverse and that is part of our continuing journey to create a work environment that everyone can achieve their true potential. Slide Number 5 is my management philosophy that I have followed throughout my business career. And we have talked about this many times before, so I don’t want to dwell on it. Slide Number 6 shows our 5 point plan for Air Products as we move forward. We are committed to have best-in-class performance to maintain our current leadership position, grow the company by expanding our offering related to our core competencies, continue to change the culture of the company and most important, to achieve our higher purpose. That higher purpose is to create a company that people feel they belong and their contributions are recognized and valued; a company that is committed to sustainability and supportive of the communities in which we operate; a company that our people want to work for where they are proud to be a part of an innovative process to solve the energy and environmental challenges facing the human race. That is our higher purpose and we are committed to it. Please turn to Slide Number 7, which shows the key milestones in our gasification strategy. Let me take the opportunity to provide an update on a few of these exciting projects. As I said last quarter, the Lu'An project continues to run very well and is contributing to our results as we expected. The Jazan ASU, the main air separation units, they are built on budget and on time and they are in the process of being commissioned as we speak. The definitive contract for the Jazan gasifier and power plants, which are very complex contracts and many of them are being negotiated with Saudi Aramco. And we expect the conclusion of those discussions by the end of calendar 2019. We are continuing our discussion with YK Group for the very large coal to syngas project. This project is a still underway. And there are some issues related to the allocation of coal, which is very important for us but the project has the support of central government. And we are optimistic that we will have more definitive announcements about the project as we move forward. And for the Juitai project, that project is under construction with expected on stream in 2022. In addition to these announced projects, as we have said before we continue to work on a significant number of very large new gasification opportunities around the world. Now please go to Slide Number 8, where you can see the results of our key profitability metrics. We remain committed to our goal of continuing to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these metrics. Now please go to a Slide Number 9, which is always my favorite slide and particularly this quarter. You can see our record quarterly EBITDA margin up 37.7%, which is up over 1,200 basis points from five years ago. This is a great achievement by the people of Air Products and all of us are very proud of it. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss the results in detail. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a summary of our Q2 results. As Seifi said, our team delivered another impressive quarter. Volume added 3%, demonstrating the success of our growth strategy. Price was also up 3%, which is our best performance in over four years. Sales of $2.2 billion were up 1% as the better volume and price was roughly offset by 4% negative currency and 2% due to a contract change in India. As a reminder, we agreed with a customer in India to convert our hydrogen supply agreement into a tolling arrangement. This change has no impact on our profits but reduces sales for the company and for our EMEA segment but we are showing the sales impact in the other line. This change began in December, so the second quarter includes the full quarterly effect. We saw lower sales as we near the end of our successful Jazan sales equipment project. Excluding this impact, volumes grew 5% due to positive base volumes and additional new plant on-streams, including Lu'An in Asia. Price was particularly strong across all three regions and across our merchant product lines. Great job by our team as we stay focused on pricing. Currency was again a headwind as the dollar strengthened against all major currencies. EBITDA of $825 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.92 both improved 12%, driven by the higher volumes and positive pricing, partially offset by unfavorable currency and higher cost. EBITDA margin reached a record 37.7%, up 340 basis points compared to prior year as a result of higher volume and price, as well as the India contract modification. ROCE of 12.6% improved 80 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher profits. Sequentially EBITDA increased 4% as better results in Americas and EMEA more than offset reduced Jazan sales equipment and lower volumes due to the lunar New Year holidays in Asia. Please turn to Slide 11. Our second quarter GAAP EPS was $1.90, and includes a $5 million one-time pension settlement cost. Our second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.92 was up 12% or $0.21 per share, driven by strong operating performance. Volume, price and costs together contributed $0.30. As you see on this slide, the impact of price increases is shown net of the impact of variable cost rate increases, primarily variable production costs, such as power and distribution costs in our merchant business. The other cost line refers to fixed cost increases, such as personnel and plant maintenance costs. The other cost increase this quarter was driven in part by labor inflation and higher maintenance. And as we've said previously, we continue to see cost associated with investment and our capabilities to successfully win and execute our growth strategy. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.08 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and the euro. Excluding the unfavorable currency, EPS increased $0.29 or 17% over last year. Non-operating items, including interest expense, non-controlling interest and non-operating income, combined for a negative $0.01. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.9%, roughly flat compared to prior year. For FY19, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. Now please turn to Slide 12. We continue to generate strong cash flow. During the last 12 months, we generated almost $11 per share or over $2.4 billion of distributable cash flow. This distributable cash flow allowed us to pay almost $1 billion or about 40% as dividends to our shareholders and still have nearly $1.5 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business. This strong cash flow enables us to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. Slide Number 13 updates our capital deployment progress and we have reformatted the information to hopefully make it more clear for you. As you can see, we now show just over $16 billion of investment capacity available over the five-year period from FY2018 through FY2022. This is made up of the three components, first is additional debt available today. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted AA2 rating. If we maintain this rating at a debt level of about 3 times the last 12 months EBITDA, we have about $8.7 billion available today. Second, based on LTM investible cash flow, we expect to over $5 billion between now and the end of FY2022. Third, we've already deployed almost $2.5 billion on M&A and growth projects. This excludes maintenance CapEx. Today, we have a total of about $7.5 billion of project and M&A commitments with about $6.8 billion remaining to spend on them. Though, you can see we have already spent 15% and already committed well over half of our total available capacity. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to our Asia results on Slide Number 14. There you can see that our great team in Asia delivered yet another strong set of results. Our China base business recovered well from the Lunar New Year holiday, and continues to show positive growth. And our other strong positions throughout Asia continue to contribute. We remain very focused on our current business and are also very positive about our long-term growth potential in this region. For the quarter, sales were up 12% from last year as a result of positive volume and price more than offsetting negative currency. Volumes increased 12%, primarily driven by new projects, mostly Lu'An. Overall, pricing for the region was up 5% versus last year, the 8th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price improvement. The strong volume and price also favorably impacted both profits and margins. EBITDA increased by 32% and EBITDA margin improved 700 basis points to a record 47.7%, making Asia our most profitable region. I am very proud of the performance of our team in this region. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas result. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of our Americas results. For the quarter, sales increased 9%, primarily driven by 5% higher volume and 3% higher price. Demand for hydrogen was robust in both the Gulf Coast, which is supported by the new Baytown facility in Canada. Our base merchant business also continued to grow in North America, while Latin America remains weak. Overall, this is the ninth consecutive quarter of volume improvement for the region. Freights contributed a positive 3%, the best performance in over four years. Americas EBITDA of almost $400 million increased 10% and reported EBITDA margins of over 40% were up 60 basis points, primarily driven by higher volumes and pricing. EBITDA margin was up 150 basis points, excluding the impact of higher energy cost pass through. Earlier this week, we announced a new project for our second ASU for Big River Steel in Arkansas. This new ASU will support big River Steel's expansion and the local merchant market, and it builds on the success of our first ASU that came on-stream a few years ago. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our EMEA results. Our EMEA business produced positive operational results this quarter despite limited economic growth as strong pricing offset negative currency. Compared to last year, price improved 3% while volume held firm. We saw 7% sales impact from unfavorable currency and 9% sales reduction due to the India contract change. Price improved across all major merchant products and across all sub-regions. The 3% price increase marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. Reported EBITDA of $182 million was up 2% and EBITDA was up 9% on a constant currency basis. Reported EBITDA margin improved 500 basis points. Excluding the India contract change, EBITDA margin was up about 200 basis points. And although we continue to see Brexit as a potential risk to our future results, at this point, we have not seen any significant negative impacts. Now please turn to Slide 17 Global Gases, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as central industrial gas business cost. Sales and EBITDA declined due to lower project activity as we approach the conclusion of our very successful Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. Please turn to Slide 18, corporate segment, which includes LNG and other businesses, as well as our corporate costs. Although, this quarter sales and profit have yet to show improvement, we anticipate a turnaround in the LNG business. We recently announced a major project win to supply our proprietary technology and equipment to the Golden Pass LNG export project in the Gulf coast. Since this is sale of equipments where the revenue and profit are booked based on percentage of completion, we expect this project to contribute to our earnings later in calendar 2019. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. Please turn to Slide Number 19. Almost five years ago, in July of 2014 during my first conference call with the investment community, I promised to grow the company's earnings per share by at least 10% annually. As you can see, we have done better than that and achieved 13% cumulative average growth rate over the last five years. We have delivered what we promised and more. Thanks to the great team at Air Products. Our goal continues to be, to achieving a cumulative average growth rate of at least 10% in the coming years. Now that we are talking about the coming years, we do understand that we live in an uncertain world. And we, at Air Products, cannot influence the world's economic or political developments. But we do have control over what Air Products can and should do as a company to react to the changing world. We have a strong, capable and flexible organization, which remains focused on productivity and creating our own growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to deliver on our promises to investors as we go forward. So now for what we promised this year, please turn to Slide Number 20. We are increasing our EPS guidance for fiscal year 2019 to a range of $8.15 to $8.30. Despite currency headwinds at the midpoint, our guidance represents 10% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance. For quarter three of fiscal year 2019, our earnings per share guidance is $2.10 to $2.15, up 8% to 10% over last year. We have also slightly increased our CapEx forecast to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2019. Our team around the world continues to be excited about Air Products' future. Our five point strategic plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward. And our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation of our continued growth. We have the financial capacity, the technological knowhow and the talent to successfully pursue the exciting opportunities that we see ahead. And finally, please turn to Slide Number 21. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance. I want to again thank all of our 16,000 employees around the world for their commitment and hard work, and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of winning together. I am very proud to be part of this winning team. Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John McNulty with BMO Capital.
John McNulty: It seems like there's a lot of opportunities in the coal gasification arena. You're certainly highlighting, it sounds like, a lot of projects that you're at least considering. Can you help us to understand how you prioritize or what some of the bigger priorities are when you're picking a partner for these projects as we think about the future investment going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: John, we have always said that when we look at these projects and there are many of them as we said. The very first thing that we do is make an assessment, whether the project is economically viable. That means that if they are making diesel fuel or if they are making olefins, or whatever it is that the end part that is going to come out of this project; how is the market for that product; where is it going to be sold; what are the expected prices; and does the full project make economic sense, that's number one. Once we have satisfied ourselves that that is the case then the second thing that we focus is on the customer that we are dealing with; who is actually doing this project; what is their financial strength; what is their expenses, what is their market position and all of that. Then if we have passed economic test and passed the market test then quite honestly we do the project unless it is in a very, very, very difficult part of the world, and there are not that many of them. So the basic message that I have is that we don’t look at the projects like, oh, this project is in China, we don’t want to do it or this project is in India, we don’t look at that. We look at what is the project and whom is it for. I have said many times if you give me a project that makes economical sense and it is for Saudi Aramco, we will do it no matter where it is in the world. So those are the criterias that we follow.
John McNulty: And then I guess when you look at the projects out there, I think last quarter you'd highlighted there were 50-plus projects out there that you were at least evaluating. What portion of those are projects that are already up and running where the actual producer is saying, "You know what, we'd rather outsource this," similar to what we saw with the refining industry back, I don't know, 20, 30 years ago as they started kind of outsourcing the business. So how should we be thinking about that and the opportunities there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Probably 10% to 20% of them are in that category.
Operator: Next question comes from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Kieran on for Chris. Congratulations on the good quarter. I was wondering if you can discuss the trends that you're seeing in APAC, particularly in China. I mean, are there any key end markets that you are you seeing slower accelerate. Then also just regarding this quarter, any impact you saw from the Lunar New Year and how we should think about volumes in the sequential basis?
Seifi Ghasemi: With respect in China, I've said this many times, we don’t see any particular weakening in any -- at least -- we had exposure to a lot of the businesses. And one of the interesting thing about our business that you know very well is that we don’t have any inventory. So our performance is instantaneous whatever the economy is doing you see that in our numbers. China is going very well. And a Lunar New Year, China this year we were very concerned about that and that's why we were conservative in our guidance for the quarter. The Chinese New Year, although, it fell in between these, it went down and came back exactly like every other year and the economy is doing very well and we continue to be very optimist. We are very bullish on China.
Unidentified Analyst: And then just when I look at your full-year guidance, it implies a very strong fourth quarter, little bit stronger I think than like the third quarter. Maybe can you just discuss the key elements that are driving that positive outlook for the fourth quarter and then for the back half of the year? I appreciate it thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, we expect that the pricing momentum that we have seen would continue and actually might become even better than what we have seen before. So that is one thing that keeps us optimistic. The other thing is that Brexit is delayed until October, so we don’t expect any significant negative effects on that. The other thing is that our LNG project business, as you know, this is not contributing anything. But we did win a very big project, Golden Pass in Texas. And since with that project, we have start getting paid as soon as we started working on it, we expect some contribution from that. And the fourth thing is that we expect that the effect of negative currency to be a little bit better. And you put all of that together that is what makes us optimistic that we would be able to meet the higher end of, or at least our goal is to meet the higher end of our forecast, which is [indiscernible]
Operator: The next question comes from line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Just on the merchant pricing, can you go through the merchant price gains you realized in each of the three major regions?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, David, you know our business better than anybody and you know that half of our business is on site and there is not a lot of price increase in there. So as a rule of thumb, you can take the numbers that we have given you for each region, multiply it by two and you end-up with what we achieved in the merchant business. And you see that it is a strong -- it’s a 7%, 8%, 11% in the different regions.
David Begleiter: And just on YK projects, Seifi, any concerns on your part given the elongated timeline to finalize the details here?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I don’t have any concern. That project is a project that has a strong support of the central government. The central government wants that to happen. The issue is the allocation of coal to that project. That is a very important issue for us, because we don't want to do any big gasification project when the source of coal is not 100% guaranteed. I mean YK is a big coal company but they need to get allocation of the coal. So the negotiation with that is taking longer than what we expected, but I fully expect that project to go forward. The timing might be a little bit different than what we expect today. But I think that that is a good project, it makes a lot of sense and it will eventually happen.
Operator: Next we'll go to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: This is actually Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. I guess to follow-up on the pricing dynamics. Nice acceleration this quarter. I was hoping you can maybe give a sense of where you think merchant operating rates are today, particularly in North America and Asia?
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. North America operating rates are in about mid-70s. The operating rates in Europe are around in the low 80s. And the operating rate in the areas that we operate in Asia is about in mid-80s.
Mike Leithead: And then on the LNG market. It seems like activity and optimism is starting to pick-up in that area. I was hoping you could maybe characterize outside of the project you just signed, where do you think overall market dynamics will start to be a tailwind as we get to the back of this year or maybe that's closer to a 2020 event?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, in 2019, our fiscal year ends at the end of September. So we did have a positive impact from the Golden Pass project, but that's not going to be huge. But as we go forward, we are very optimistic about that business. As you know that business use to make us $50 million of EBITDA a year, and today it's making nothing. So we think that in time we will get to that $150 million rate in the next three, four years. We are very optimistic about the LNG business that's why we never considered divesting of it. We have a huge technological advantage. Almost 70% -- 75% of all the large LNG projects use our technology, and we see many of them happening in the U.S. and around the world. So we continue to -- we expect a very positive future for that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: The EBITDA margin in Asia is now roughly 48%, and maybe a year-ago it was 38%. Is the difference in the margin, the Lu'An project essentially?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, the fact is a significant amount of that is also, Lu'An is obviously affecting it. But there is obviously the fact that we have gotten significant pricing. I mean, our mission pricing in last quarter was 11% ahead of last year. So that is a very positive contributor. And beside that our people there are doing a good job in productivity and keeping the cost under control. So overall, as I said I'm very proud of what they have done. And I'm optimistic that we have been eager to maintain that kind of a margin as we go forward.
Jeff Zekauskas: For the Jazan gasifier in the power JV, I think you said earlier in the call that you're trying to negotiate the final terms by the end of the year. If you successfully negotiate those terms, when would that project begin to affect your income statement?
Seifi Ghasemi: If we successfully complete the negotiations by the end of the year and financially close that project will contribute in 2019 and then obviously in 2020, and then the big impact will be in 2021. But it will definitely impact 2019 it'd be completed by the end of fiscal year this year.
Operator: And we'll go to John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Pricing was largely offset by foreign exchange. I guess in once sense you could say that pricing in dollar terms was roughly flat year-over-year. Do you think pricing in currency are completely unrelated, or do think the exchange rates are giving you a little bit more ability to price in local currency?
Seifi Ghasemi: The currency has nothing to do with it our business is absolutely low cost. And whether the dollar is up or down, it has no effect on our ability to increase the lower prices in different parts of the board. This is not like crude oil or anything like that. So it is totally independent, John.
John Roberts: And then I know it's too early to have a CapEx budget for 2020, but since we're halfway through fiscal '19. At this point, do you know whether 2020 will be up or stable with the 2019 CapEx budget?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, I expect our 2020 CapEx will be probably north of $2 billion.
Operator: Now we'll next go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
Jim Sheehan: Can you comment on the ACP Europe acquisition, about how much did you pay for that and how much earnings contribution will it represent?
Seifi Ghasemi: The amount that we take for that, I think we have disclosed that. It's about more than $100 million. And obviously the rule of thumb that we always tell you is if you spend $100 million that should give us operating income of $10 million.
Operator: Now we'll next go to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort: Seifi, you talked about gasification business about prioritize your project load there. And I guess if we look at breakeven levels for maybe making glycol or olefins, or fertilizer we're easily there. When Brent starts to get up in the $75 range then maybe coal to fuels or coal to synthetic natural gas comes in play. In that project portfolio that you're pursuing, are you seeing greater interest in those, maybe higher breakeven type applications to gasification?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes.
Robert Koort: And are those exclusively in China, or are they more broad globally?
Seifi Ghasemi: As the price of oil goes up, the number of projects that we come by obviously becomes big. So you are right on that.
Robert Koort: Can I ask you on the de-cap side, Seifi, I think there has been over the last couple of years, there has been some shareholder frustration expressed about deploying that capital and now you're starting to do that more aggressively. Is there a de-cap opportunity here in gasification? I know Shell, when they own the business, certainly advertise the process improvements they've made overtime -- the history and portfolio of gasifiers they have in operation gave them an advantage. Is there an ability to go to speak to existing gasifiers and suggest you can operate them better with improvements in technology? Or how would you -- what will be the selling points that you'd make to an existing gasification customer to maybe let you take that off their hands and operate it?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, Bob, I mean you are exactly accurate in terms of the argument we will use. And quite frankly, the very best example of what you just said is the IGCC project in Saudi Arabia, the Jazan project that we are talking about. We went to Saudi Aramco and that we have improvements in the Shell technology. And they are all using shale technology for gasifying the bottom of the refinery, and that is asset buyback. So that is an ideal example of what you're talking about. And there are others like that that obviously we are pursuing.
Operator: Now we'll go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Vincent. So just a quick question around the gasification projects. So with the explosion that happened in the fertilizer plant in China, I was wondering has anything changed in terms of the number of projects you are seeing. Obviously, you're very bullish on that. But maybe you can give us an update on the 50 plus project number that you mentioned earlier, and just how that explosion is impacting that number?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all that explosion has nothing to do what we are doing. It has no impact.
Unidentified Analyst: I guess, I mean just more from a regulatory perspective in terms of -- I guess, new projects, whether it's in olefins or anything else. I guess you are not seeing any impact from that is what you are saying?
Seifi Ghasemi: That's correct.
Unidentified Analyst: And then maybe just as a quick follow-up just on CapEx. I was wondering if you could give us some color as to what drove that, increasing the CapEx for 2019.
Seifi Ghasemi: In 2019, I think that Scott can answer that.
Scott Crocco: I think you are referring to taking up the bottom of the range from [Multiple Speakers], it's just that we're half way through the year, better estimates of the spending and some other smaller projects that we're spending on.
Unidentified Analyst: And then if I may just one quick follow-up as well. You have volumes obviously. You had tough comps there last year. But as I look at the next couple of quarters just curious as to your -- what will you view volume there going for the next couple of quarters?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'm not sure quite honestly I understood the question.
Unidentified Analyst: Just what your expectations and volume are for your -- it's actually for the coming quarters.
Seifi Ghasemi: For just Europe or for everywhere else in general…
Unidentified Analyst: For Europe…
Seifi Ghasemi: For Europe, we expect the run rate to continue. We are not, as I said, the Brexit delayed, we are not concerned about volumes in Europe and we remain positive about pricing in Europe.
Operator: Next question comes from line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson: I want to go to your favorite slide, Slide Number 9, new record on EBITDA margin 37.7%. How much of that was due to -- what's the impact to that India conversion the tolling on that? And I assume that most of your upward momentum in EBITDA margins due to price. So are we at an inflection point in pricing here? Traditionally, you didn’t get pricing in this industry till you're well into the 80s, but you seem to be getting pricing earlier. So I guess the final question is you used to think 35% of EBITDA margin was a normalized level. So is 37%, 38% the new normal?
Seifi Ghasemi: The number one is that the effect of the -- it's about 80 basis points in terms of India, that’s number. The second thing is that with respect to where would the EBITDA margin be, I've always told people from way back that when you're modeling Air Products, model an EBITDA margin of 35% to 36%. And I would still suggest that. We did do very well this quarter. We will see what the next quarter brings. But I don’t want to start predicting that we will hit 37.7% every quarter. But I think it is safe to assume that we will be around 35% on average.
Don Carson: And on pricing, do you think we're at an inflection point here where the improvements you've seen in merchant pricing is sustainable? Again, you seem to be getting the pricing at lower rates than you historically needed to get pricing?
Seifi Ghasemi: Don, I heard your question and I was trying to maybe not answering it. You know that we don’t like to make any comments on pricing considering the nature of our industry. So you need to let me off the hook of that.
Operator: Now we'll go to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: For these large coal gasification projects that are now in your backlogs. What fraction of that total installed equipment would you say is going to be fabricated at one of your locations versus field fabrication? And do you expect that shift change overtime as you get more and more of these projects under your belt and be able to develop more of a capability to fabricate at a central location and lower your capital costs, time to erect and competitiveness?
Seifi Ghasemi: Let me answer them one at a time. With respect to -- with these coal gasifications, the part that we make ourselves is the air separation unit, the main coal boxes. Those coal boxes are manufactured right now exclusively mostly in China. So as we expand, we have expanded our operation in China, in Caojing, south of Shanghai. As we expand, we continue to expand that facility. And if we get to a stage that we need additional capacity, we know where to go. So that is -- with the rest of these coal gasification facilities, we do not manufacture them ourselves, a lot of them are engineered and designed and built at the drop site. And they are prefabricated at different locations and brought together and assembled together like an electro set. So there is no constraint on our ability to manufacture these.
Steve Byrne: Just like some furnaces are fabricated and then shipped to a job site. Could you anticipate the gasifier units being moved in that direction and ultimately reducing the total capital costs for these projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: The capital costs for these projects, depending on where they are, can significantly be reduced if you break down the projects like we did in Jazan, and pre-fabricate them at the most cost effective area. When you look at Jazan, and hopefully we can show you a movie of it on time. You see that it was like an erector set. We had 450 ton unit of all of the piping manufactured actually in China, which was the lowest cost, and then it was shipped and then put together with the rest of the plan. So we did a lot -- we did not do a lot of the cutting and building and all of that in Jazan, which would have been very expensive. So that is what you do in terms of trying to reduce the cost. There air separation part, which is about usually on these big project is, separation part is about 10% of the cost that one we manufacture it in several pieces in Caojing and then ship to the job site and put it together.
Steve Byrne: And just lastly out of your 16,000 employees, what fraction would you say are involved in engineering and construction?
Seifi Ghasemi: About more than 20% on engineering, the construction, the actual construction when we are building a plant like Jazan, we have construction supervision people. And just to give you a number for Jazan when we were building it, we had about 200 of our people supervising it but the number of people who are actually building the plant they're 6,000. Those people, we hired locally for the project. They are not permanent employees. Out of the 16,000, about 20% are dedicated engineering and project management people that we have and they are long-term employees of Air Products and we are very proud of it.
Operator: Next we go to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Seifi, I was wondering if you could comment on the nature and level of competitive intensity in the gasification arena, specifically and anecdotally it would seem that some of your competitors have a different strategy in terms of their focus. Curious if you survey your 50 plus projects there. How often are you running into the other global majors? And to what degree is the customer source of competition in a sense for you?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, you are asking me a very difficult question, I don’t know how to answer that, because I obviously am in no position to speak for our competitors. If their strategy is that they are not optimistic about these projects, I hope they continue to follow that strategy. I really cannot comment on behalf of our customers that when they are dealing with us, how many other people they are talking and all of that. We always behave as if we have competition, and we try to give the very best offer that we can to our customers. So that's the extent that I want to comment on this.
Operator: Next we'll go to P. J. Juvekar with Citi.
P. J. Juvekar: So my question on crude to chemicals projects that are being discussed around the world. Do you have any technology there similar to your gasification technology? And if not, they will still consume lot of gases. So what are you seeing or hearing about request of bids for ASUs for those projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think on all of those projects, people would be looking for this for ASUs. We are trying to differentiate ourselves, but making an offer to the customers that we provide you, not only the ASU but also the gasification. And therefore, a different package rather than just competing for the ASU, which most of the time if the customer want to buy the ASUs by themselves, they usually do sale of equipment rather than sale of gas. And as you see, most of the current existing gasifiers in China, which there are many, have all been sale of equipment. So we are trying to differentiate ourselves by getting a bigger package. But if the customer insist that no, I just want a bit for the air separation unit, we usually -- depending on who the customer is, we usually give them a bid, because I'll be happy to build air separation unit. But we are trying to differentiate ourselves by giving the bigger package to the customer.
P. J. Juvekar: And then a question on Europe, your pricing has lagged there in the past. Now you are getting some solid 6% merchant pricing. And I know in the past you walked away from some low margin businesses in Europe. What are you seeing from new players that were created recently in merchant business in Europe? And there is also a new merchant player in the U.S. What kind of behavior are you seeing from them?
Seifi Ghasemi: It's too soon for us to comment on that. Quite honestly, we usually don’t comment on that anyway, but these people have been in business for a few months. So it's very difficult to make an assessment on that. But you said the key thing, P. J. and I said this publicly in February at a conference. The reason we are getting the pricing is because we are willing to walk away from volume, that is the key thing that we are saying that our costs have gone up and all of that, this is the price of our product, if the customer wants to go buy from somebody else, they can. And the willingness to walk away from low margin business is what is giving us the ability to increase the prices. Otherwise, we will never increase prices. So that is a different strategy for us. That's exactly right.
Operator: We'll next go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Mike Sison: When you think about your 10% growth, EPS growth goal, you've got Jazan gasifier coming on next year and looks like four projects on that one slide. Could 2020 be -- given those projects coming on, could 2020 be a year where you maybe outpace that goal?
Seifi Ghasemi: We always say that -- we always promise them what we can deliver and usually deliver more than what we promise. So, I don’t want to get ahead of myself. But I hope what you're saying would turn out to be true.
Mike Sison: And then just one quick one on Asia again, margins very good, actually pretty sweet. If you think about the second half of the year, do you think that you can sustain that level? And then what impacts that margin going forward given 48% is pretty impressive level?
Seifi Ghasemi: I expect our EBITDA margins in Asia to continue to be at around those numbers.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll next go to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: I wanted to go at the pricing question a little bit differently. I wanted ask specifically about China. Can you comment on what you're seeing in LOX/LIN supply and demand dynamics in the areas that you play in China? Just trying to get a sense of how sustainable the pricing momentum could be there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Mike, as I mentioned before, the operating rates in the regions that we operate in China is getting to around mid-80s. And when you get to mid-80s then you do have pricing power. So our loss in pricing has been going up. And if the economy stays the way and the operating rates stays the way it is, which I think it will, because nobody is building a brand new plant right away. So I expect that we would continue to have good momentum.
Mike Harrison: And then I was also wondering about -- in your appendix there, you have a number of projects that were listed as starting-up during the first quarter of fiscal '19, two of them in Korea, two of them in the U.S. I was just wondering, did we see a full contribution from all four of those projects during the fiscal second quarter or are some of them still ramping-up?
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, we do.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.
Jonas Oxgaard: I was wondering, you had some pretty hefty currency headwinds there. But do you get any currency tailwinds on the CapEx side from this?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, you are there, I guess to some extent we do. I mean the dollar content of a lot of the projects that we make is not that huge but, we do get a tailwind from that, you are right.
Jonas Oxgaard: And is that reflected in your guidance? Can you help me size the impact and how that's reflected in your guidance?
Seifi Ghasemi: The fact that the capital cost of the projects will go down, and that is minutiae, it's not material to our numbers. As we go forward, we expect the headwind on the currency to subside a little bit than you go quarter-by-quarter. So as Scott was telling me before the call, we expect that for next quarter the headwind will be less than $0.08 and hopefully for the quarter after that less than that. Obviously, none of us can predict what will happen to the currencies and all of that. But if the currency rates stay about the same, we should have not as much of a headwind in the third quarter. But Scott can amplify on that.
Scott Crocco: If you just want to build on and see as we've said we've got $0.08 unfavorable here in this quarter. For the year, our projection is maybe $0.15 to $0.20 headwind. And just as a reminder, the way that we look at this is when we come out of the quarter, we don't try to project where rates are going to go, we just hold them steady to where they are. And when you compare them the third quarter versus prior year third quarter and the fourth quarter versus prior fourth quarter, we don't see -- as Seifi just mentioned, we don't see the third quarter to be as much as $0.08, down a little bit. And then even less in the fourth quarter, not because we're projecting a change in exchange rate, but rather just where were rates last year, so just want to get on that. And again, as we've mentioned earlier in the call, we're talking all translation. There is no economic impact, it's just math bringing it back. So just figured I take it through. And lastly since I'm on this subject, given sensitivities in the past around swings in currencies of 10% for the R&D on an annual basis, a swing of 10% would be about $0.12. For the euro, swing of 10% would be about $0.09. And then there is a basket of other currencies, like the pound, Korean won, Taiwanese dollar and the Canadian dollar. Each it just move them by 10%, it's about $0.03 to $0.04 each. And what I've just given you there is roughly when you throw in the U.S. dollar sales approach at 85% to 90% of the company. So I just figured I take it through some of those numbers.
Jonas Oxgaard: As a follow-up -- so the take or pays that you're signing. Do you usually sign them in dollars or local currency?
Seifi Ghasemi: It depends -- in some countries, it’s in local currencies; in some countries, it’s in dollar terms' depending on the country and how we feel about the customer and their expectation of currency.
Jonas Oxgaard: And if you take China coal as the biggest one, that sways the future?
Seifi Ghasemi: In China, the contracts that we have are in Reminbi in local Chinese.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Dan Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. I'm sorry if I missed this. But did you quantify the backlog and how it has changed this quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Simon, you want to -- since you prepared the slide, do you want to make any comment?
Simon Moore: As we said, our total project commitments are about $7.5 billion. I think that's up from around $7 billion last time. And again just to be clear on that that's the total value of the commitments we have. What we have remaining to spend on those is about $6.8 billion.
Dan Rizzo: And then just one other question. Could the gasification evolve to where we see large take-or-pay arrangements rather than JVs in some regions?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, right now the gasification project, some of them is JVs and some of them is 100% ourselves like [indiscernible]…
Scott Crocco: If I could just add, they are all take-or-pay, so just to be clear about that…
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, whether it's JV or not, it's all take-or-pay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we have run over the time. And since there are no other questions, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the very best. Thank you again.
Operator: And that does conclude today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-01-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to Air Products and Chemicals First Quarter Earnings Release Conference. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Simon Moore: Thank you, April. Good morning everyone. Welcome to Air Products first quarter 2019 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number two. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call and we do appreciate your interest in Air Products. The talented, motivated and committed team of Air Products delivered another quarter of strong, safety and financial results. Our quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 represents then 19th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-over-year quarterly EPS growth. Excluding the impact of plant sale last year, our EPS was up 9%. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with an EBITDA margin above 35%. We are in a very strong financial position and our business generates significant cash flow. This allows us to continue to invest capital into value creating projects to profitably grow the company while also continuing to return cash to our shareholders. Yesterday, we announced our 37th consecutive year of dividend increase. We are proud of our new quarterly dividend of $1.16 and I would like to stress quarterly dividend of a $1.16 per share in turn means that we will return about $1 billion in cash to our shareholders over the next year. At Air Products we have great, talented and committed team who stayed focus on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders everyday. Now please turn to Slide 3. All of our 16,000 employees around the world are focused on safety. And as a result, we have improved our lost injury rate by 83% and recordable injury rate by 33% since 2014. On Slide 4, you can see goal which is to be the best safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. On a Slide 5, you can see our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before. We have come a long way over the last four years. However, we continued to be focused on shareholder value, capital allocation and an empowered and decentralized organization. Now please turn to Slide 6 to see our five point strategic plan. We remained focus on sustaining our lead in safety and financial performance. We continue to see tremendous opportunities to deploy capital in value creating projects. Primarily in our onsite business. Scott will take you through the numbers but let me provide you a quick overview of our progress. Since the start of fiscal year 2018, we have spent and committed over $8 billion on exciting new growth projects. Both Scott and I remained committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. At this rating, we believe we still have about $14 billion remaining to invest. So we have already spent or committed over half of the $16 billion available over the five year period of fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2022. We recently announced new projects in California, Minnesota, India, Algeria and China. We have made great progress so far. And I remained very confident and I like to stress the word very confident of our ability to deploy this capital into high return industrial gas projects that will generate sign cant value for our shareholders. The fourth point of our plan is to continue to improve our 4S culture, meaning safety, simplicity, speed and self confidence to create a committed and motivated environment where our team brings their positive attitudes and open minds to work everyday. And finally we do have a higher purpose to create an inclusive and enjoyable environment for all of our people, so that everybody feels proud to innovate, solve challenges and contribute to our communities. We remained focused on executive these five points plan. Our goal is to be the best industrial gas company in the world not the biggest. Now please turn to Slide 7, where you can see our dividend history. As I said, we are proud of our 37 year record of increasing the dividend. And we are excited about giving over $1 billion to our shareholders in 2019 via dividend in cash. This direct cash return to our shareholders complements the tremendous investment opportunities that will driver Air Products growth for many years to come. On a Slide 8, you can see our gasification strategy that continues to be a key focus of our investment opportunities. Gasification is just another way to syngas that can be turned into a wide variety of products including chemicals, diesel fuel, high end olefins, polymers, hydrogen and/or power. A key benefit of gasification is that it enables environmentally friendly way to use lower value feedstocks. We have successfully supported this market over the last few years with very large air separation units providing oxygen to customers operating the gasifiers in China and Saudi Arabia. We've announced four large projects where Air Products will own and operate the gasifiers and syngas clean up and provide syngas and/or related products to our customers. The key is that these projects are consistent with our onsite business model where we don't have any raw material or product volume or price risk. The Lu'An project that we have announced before is fully on stream thanks to the continued effort of our great team in China and continues to successfully supply syngas to Lu'An for their chemical production. You see the positive impact of Lu'An in our Asia and company results this quarter and we remain confident Lu'An will deliver over $0.25 of earnings per share in fiscal year 2019. And we continue to make good progress on the other gasification projects we've announced. Now please turn to Slide 9. We remained committed to our goal of being the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics, and we are. Now please go to Slide 10 which is always my favorite slide, showing the over 1,000 basis points improvement in our EBITDA margin. Finally, please turn to a Slide 11. The successful execution of our strategy will allow us to deliver 13% compounded annual earnings per share growth over the last five years. Based on the midpoint of our fiscal year 2019 guidance. We will continue to execute our strategy and we believe we will deliver an increase our earnings per share by at least 10% per year on average over the coming years. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss the results in details. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 12 for a summary of our Q1 results. As Seifi said, our team delivered another strong quarter with underlying volumes and pricing up across all three regions. Before I get into the results, as a reminder, we had a plant sale in China in the first quarter of last year. So we will help you understand our results excluding this event. Also during this quarter, we agreed with our customers in India to restructure our hydrogen supply agreement to exclude natural gas pass through and turn this into a tolling arrangement. This change has no impact on our profits but it does reduce company sales, as well as sales for our EMEA segment. So we are showing the sales impact in the other line. This change only impacted December, so we have larger impact beginning next quarter. Overall reported sales of $2.2 billion were flat, but were up 9% excluding the Jazan sale of equipment, the prior year plant sale and the India contract language change. Excluding Jazan and the plant sale, volumes grew 5% with positive base volumes up in all three regions and the full on stream of Lu'An in Asia. Sequential volumes were down 4%, primarily due to the customer planned maintenance outages and weaker seasonal volumes. Price improved in all three regions for the second consecutive quarter. Merchant pricing rose 3% which translated into an increase of 1% for the total company. Negative currency was driven by the Chinese RMB, the Euro, the Indian Rupee and the Chilean Peso. EBITDA of nearly $800 million improved 8% and was up 12% excluding the prior year plant sale. This improvement was driven by higher volumes, positive pricing and equity affiliate income partially offset by higher cost and unfavorable currency. EBITDA margin of 35.7% was up 250 basis points compared to prior year. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 were up 4% versus prior year. And up 9% excluding the prior year plant sale. ROCE of 12.4% improved 50 basis points versus last year, primarily due to higher profit. Please turn to Slide 13. We have non-GAAP items this quarter that totaled $0.29 per share. This included $0.10 for an asset write-off for a government enforced customer plant shutdown. We continue to negotiate the situation but do not anticipate additional charges. We also had negative $0.19 from a revised estimate of the Tax Act impact. Our first quarter adjusted continuing operation EPS of $1.86 was up $0.07 per share and up $0.15 excluding the prior year plant sale. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.13. Excluding the prior year plant sale, volume contributed $0.21. Price and raw materials taken together increased EPS by $0.05. Net cost performance with unfavorable $0.06 as productivity in Asia was offset by higher cost in Americas. Additionally, and as we've said in the past, we continue to see cost associated with our investment and capabilities in our business development, engineering, project execution and technology areas to drive growth in the future. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.04 unfavorable, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and the EURO. Equity affiliate income added $0.03 primarily due to new plant and operational strength in Mexico. The overall tax rate was $0.03 headwind versus last year, consistent with our expectations. We expect the FY2019 tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 20%. Finally, we have other items that combined for a negative $0.01 including higher non operating income offset by higher interest expense. Now please turn to Slide 14. We continue to generate strong cash flow. During the last 12 months, we generated almost $11 per share or $2.3 billion of distributable cash flow, nearly $100 million higher than fiscal year 2018. The $2.3 billion of distributable cash flow allowed us to pay over $900 million or about 40% as dividends and still have over $1.4 billion available for higher return investments in our core industrial gas business. This strong cash flow enables us to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. Slide 15 shows our capital deployment progress and is an update of the information we introduced last quarter. Since the start of FY2018, we've spent about $1.8 billion on M&A and growth projects, excluding maintenance capital. In addition, we've committed but yet not spend almost $6.5 billion on projects in M&A. We continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. If we maintain this rating and debt level of about 3x the last 12 months EBITDA, we've over $8.5 billion available to invest today. And based on our last 12 months investable cash flow, we expect to have almost $5.5 billion over the remaining three and three quarter years. Therefore in total we have about $14 billion remaining to invest. The almost $2 billion we spent so far and the $14 billion available gives us total of almost $16 billion of total available capacity for FY2018 through FY2022. So, you can see we have spent over 10% and committed over half of our total available capacity. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 16, Asia, where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth. I was just in Asia last week and remained very excited about our growth opportunities. We have an excellent and committed team running our business in Asia. At this point, we have not seen any meaningful impact on our business or projects as a result of any trade issues between the United States and China. It will be interesting, however, to see how the Lunar New Year holiday impacts the economy this coming quarter. We remained focused on our business in China and very positive on our long-term growth prospects in China. Sales were 3% lower than last year with 2% lower volume and 3% unfavorable currency, partially offset by better pricing and higher energy pass -through. Excluding the impact of plant sale last year that Scott mentioned, sales were up 16%. Again, excluding the impact of plant sale last year, volumes were up 17% with new projects primarily Lu'An driving about 10% of the increase, while the base business and small acquisitions accounted for the rest. Overall pricing for the region was up 1% versus last year, the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year price improvement. The Merchant business pricing was up 3% with positive pricing across all sub regions in Asia. The strong volumes and pricing plus favorable productivity increased both profits and margins. EBITDA increased by over 20% and EBITDA margin improved 920 basis points. Excluding prior year plant sale, EBITDA was up more than 30% and margins were up 470 basis points. Sequentially, profits and margins increased due to productivity and the full running rate from Lu'An. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott to discuss our Americas results.
Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi Ghasemi. Please turn to Slide 17 for a review of our Americas results. For the quarter, sales grew 9% with both volume and price up 2%. Higher energy pass-through added 7%, more than offsetting a negative 2% currency effect. Volumes from new plants, and North America based merchant were both positive and overcame weaker Latin America volumes and customer planned maintenance outages negatively impacting hydrogen volumes. Overall, this is the eight consecutive quarter of volume improvement for the region. The impact of our pricing actions is also gaining momentum as price was up 2%, the best result in three years. Merchant pricing was up 4%. Americas EBITDA increased 4% as improved volume and price as well as higher equity affiliate income due to better results in Mexico was partially offset by increased cost. While the team remains focused on driving productivity, we continue to see higher transportation and maintenance cost. EBITDA margin excluding the impact of energy pass-through was 50 basis points. Sequentially, planned customer maintenance outages negatively impacted both hydrogen volumes and maintenance costs. Excluding the impact of energy pass-through, sequential EBITDA margin was down 130 basis points. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 18 for a review our EMEA results. Sales were up 2% primarily driven by 1% better volumes and 2% higher price. The 6% higher energy pass-through was offset by unfavorable currency and the contract modification in India. As Scott mentioned, this change to a tolling agreement reduces sales and volumes but has no profit impact. Price and volume were both up for the quarter as we continue to see solid demand in a merchant market and positive results from our pricing actions. Merchant price grew 4% for the quarter. We did not see any negative impact associated with the Brexit uncertainty during this quarter. EBITDA was nearly flat as positive volume and price were offset primarily by negative currency. EBITDA margin was 31.6%, down 70 basis points. Excluding the impact of higher energy pass-through, EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points primarily due to the India plant contract change. Sequentially, volumes were down on seasonality. Price was slightly positive but rounded to flat. The EBITDA decrease was primarily due to currency and a reduction in equity affiliate income following a seasonally strong fourth quarter in our Italy joint venture. Now, please turn to Slide 19 for a brief comment on our global gases segment which includes our air separation unit, sale of equipment business as well as central and industrial gas business costs. Sales and EBITDA declined due to lower project activity as we approached the conclusion of the Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. We continue to expect the Jazan ASU project on stream in phases in fiscal 2019 and as previously communicated, we expect the Jazan ASU overall to be a headwind for FY2019 versus FY2018. Now, please turn to Slide 20 for a brief comment on our corporate segment which includes our LNG business, our helium container, business and our corporate cost. Sales and profits were about flat compared to prior year with no significant change in the LNG business. We continue to be optimistic about future prospects for the LNG business but have not yet seen the industry optimism translate into firm orders. Now, I am pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon. As you all know very well, we are living in a very uncertain world today. Air Products can't predict or control worldwide political or economic developments. But we do have control over our operational performance and our growth investment. And we are confident we will continue to deliver on the commitments we've made despite the world events. We have not seen any material impact on Air Products at this point from these global uncertainties as demonstrated by our results in the first quarter. Our team around the world continuous to be very excited about Air Products' future. Our five point strategic plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward. And our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation for our continue growth. We have the financial capacity, the opportunities and the team to successfully win key growth projects. Now please turn to Slide 21. We are all working hard everyday to be the safest, most divest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Despite increased economic and political uncertainty, our guidance for the fiscal year 2019 remains unchanged and is in a range of $8.05 to $8.30 per share. And despite currency headwinds at midpoint, our guidance represents 10% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance. For quarter two of fiscal year 2019, our earnings per share guidance is $1.80 to $1.90 at midpoint up 8% over last year. We continue to expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion for fiscal year 2019. And finally please turn to Slide 22. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance. I want to thank all of our 16,000 people around the world for their total commitment and hard work. And for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and spirit of working together. Now we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will first hear from Don Carson of Susquehanna.
DonCarson: Thank you. Good morning, Seifi. You commented that you can't control economic events obviously but could you sort of do a walk around the world just in terms of what you're seeing in your base business? Given that we are hearing that in many regions industrial production is slowing.
SeifiGhasemi: Sure. I'll start from Asia. We continue to see very good growth in countries like Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, out of those countries, India, out of those countries. With respect to China, we've not seen any slowdown yet. The only thing that concerns us and we are keeping an eye on it is how is the Lunar New Year in China play out. That means that are people going to take longer shutdowns because of the way that the Chinese New Year is kind of situated calendar wise. That people would take longer weekend or longer -- that is the only thing that we are watching. And quite frankly that is one of the reasons that contrary to our usual practice, we've given you a guidance of $0.10 rather than $0.05 a spread for this quarter. So that is -- as I said we've not seen any significant slowdown in our business in China. But the Lunar New Year and how it plays can have its effect and that is why we didn't, you can say that you are conservative in our guidance for the quarter. The rest of Asia is doing very well as I said. When we come in Europe, Europe is flat. Again, the concern that we have is what all of the turmoil with respect to Brexit. What would be the effect in the next few months on the pound exchange rate and also the business in -- our business United Kingdom? As you know, we've a big business there. So that is again another reason why we were conservative in our estimate for the second quarter. In the United States, things have not changed since we've talked last time. There is a slowdown of industrial production but we do not see any material impact on our results and that is why we are not changing our overall estimate for the year. We do expect a stronger second half than the first half because of some of the projects and pricing actions that we've taken and that are why we remain very confident about the guidance that we've given for the year. In addition, I also have to add that things remain very, very negative in Latin America but that's not a big part of our business.
DonCarson: Okay. And then a quick follow up. I noticed on Slide 13, your price cost gap narrow considerably was only $0.01 negative delta versus $0.14 last quarter. So how are you able to narrow that delta specifically on the cost side where it was only $0.06 drag this quarter versus $0.16 last quarter?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, as you recall in the last call I was very transparent about my dissatisfaction with our cost performance. So, obviously, everybody took that to heart and we've worked very hard on productivity to improve our cost position. And we hope to see that number improving as we go forward. So we've taken action, Don.
Operator: And next question from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse.
ChristopherParkinson: Thank you. Given the circumstances your result in Asia was pretty solid. Can you just parse out the key volume drivers outside of Lu'An, as well as your intermediate term expectations post the New Year, just that and quick use on the merchant market operate et cetera would be helpful? Thank you.
SeifiGhasemi: Good morning, Chris. Sure. Obviously, Lu'An was about 10% of the growth. But the rest of the growth we are reporting Asia results. The rest of the growth is coming from as I said, China. Despite what everybody says a slowdown or slowdown but they are growing at 6.6%. So we see the benefit of that in our merchant business. But in addition as I said, countries like Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, they are doing very well and the contributed to positive results.
ScottCrocco: If I could just add also that this is also an area that we saw good cost improvement as Seifi mentioned earlier. Nice cost performance in the quarter too.
ChristopherParkinson: Thank you, that's helpful. Perfect. And then also just --you mentioned plant or refinery outages in North America affecting results but this was also seen last year. So regarding the year-over-year comp, can you just comment of the planned downtime was in line with your initial expectation. And then also just what are your updated views on hydrogen demand intermediate to long term in the US, global, et cetera? Thank you.
SeifiGhasemi: Sure. First of all, the plant outages totally in line with expectations. These are -- as we grow our business and we've more and more hydrogen plants, obviously, the turnaround -- there are more turnarounds to deal with. But there is nothing out of line; they are all in accordance with our expectation. There is nothing unexpected has happened. With respect to hydrogen demand, obviously, significant driver for our hydrogen demand in the US is how many miles people drive and the gasoline demand. But that has continues to remain stable. As per the future, as you know, we have announced two new hydrogen plants that we are going to build, liquid hydrogen plants. We see significant growth opportunities for liquid hydrogen and in terms of so called gases hydrogen there are projects being discussed in the United States, in the Gulf Course and other areas that would require significant amount of hydrogen for the production of chemicals and we will obviously participate on that. So, overall, we remain very positive.
Operator: Next we will hear from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.
RobertKoort: Thanks very much, good morning. It strikes me that over the last couple of years you moved towards maybe de-risking and improving the stability of the organization by some of the divestures you made and then enhancing some of these large gasification projects, and yet your multiple that continues to go on the wrong direction. So I am wondering can you help frame through your competitive advantage and what it means to have such a significant onsite presence and sort of how do you see that developing and what it means to the volatility of your business.
SeifiGhasemi: Bob, first of all, thank you for your comments. We definitely have moved into a direction of stabilizing the business, getting the company focused on the right business and significantly enhancing our onsite presence because that is a much more stable business. And we have changed our business model to get into syngas production where we see significant opportunity. We do have the lot of cash on hand. We have a very strong balance sheet. And with the acquisition of the technologies from Shell and GE and others, we are in a very strong positive to be the leader in gasification. And there are many, many, many opportunities. As for the why our multiple, I am not selling a product stock. I mean my job is to articulate our strategy and tell our investors what we are doing, and then they will decide the multiples. I think the market is under estimating our ability to deploy the cash. And that I also understand that there is a lot of concern about gasification. It's a new area. There was a lot of concern when we announced Lu'An about this. Do you know how to run gasifiers and all of that? I am hoping that as we go forward, we demonstrate that we can run these facilities and as we sign more, large deals which will significantly strengthen our portfolio that the investors will give us due consideration in time. As I said my job is not to argue about the multiple. My job is to explain and articulate our strategy and I think in time the investors will see where we are as compared to our competitors.
RobertKoort: I appreciate that. Can I ask you very briefly on the Shell technology? You guys have mentioned applying that maybe to help solve some of high sulfur residue streams as companies try to adhere to the IMO2020 standards. And 2020 is pretty close, is that -- something that looks like there are some development there or is it getting pushed out? Is this a meaningful opportunity or just something maybe on the periphery for that business?
SeifiGhasemi: Bob, it is a meaningful opportunity. The best example of that is the $8 billion project that we are doing in Saudi Arabia. That is all about taking the bottom of the refinery and gasifying get an upgrading it because they wouldn't be able to sell that to the market for fueling the ships. So that is the best example. This opportunity is great. There is a great opportunity. The issue is that a lot of people are not taking action because they are hoping that the implementation of IMO2020 will be delayed. And as I am sure you know there is lot of lobbying going on by some of the industry in the United States to that. But in the long term that is going to be a good -- significant opportunity, yes.
Operator: And next we will hear from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.
JeffZekauskas: Thanks very much, good morning. In the different slides you spoke about merchant pricing being 3% in the Americas, 3% in Asia, 4% in EMEA. But the actual price in the slides for each of the geographic segment is lower. It's 2% in the Americas, 1% in Asia and 2% in Europe. What accounts for the difference? What's pushing down that price level? And in the overall slide that describes price it seems that costs are going up faster than price. Is that the right comparison? Or is there a real price benefit and the costs are more internal or having to do turnarounds or something like that?
SeifiGhasemi: I'll have Scott answer the question that you had asked. But on the cost side, the cost side is related to increasing our capabilities. But I'd like Scott to answer your first question. Go ahead, Scott.
ScottCrocco: Sure. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. So one of the things we introduced in the last quarter or so is what we refer to as merchant-on-merchant price increase and price change. So, as you know, Air Products has a large percentage of our portfolio, 50% in onsite. So when we go through the slides we will do price over the entire business of which two third or so in the US is tonnage. So we felt that's the 1% for AP, and 1% for Asia and 2% Americas and 2% EMEA. That's over the total portfolio of those businesses. What we thought would be helpful is to also additionally provide you with a merchant-on-merchant that looks at the price change and in this case increase so Air Products, 3%, Asia 3%, 4% for Americas, EMEA. The price increase on the merchant business. So we provide a little bit more insight as to what's going on that portion of the business as opposed to spread across the entire company. Hopefully, I was clear on that.
SeifiGhasemi: Is that clear, Jeff?
JeffZekauskas: Yes. That's clear. And then so my follow up, is it the case that your pension cost this year will drop about $65 million from $90 million to $25 million or so? And when I looked at your income statement, the non controlling interest was $9.5 million I think versus $6.9 million last year. And I would have thought the non controlling interest number would have been larger given the Lu'An has now on stream and is quite profitable. Is there something eccentric in non controlling interest number? And what are --
SeifiGhasemi: Jeff, Scott can address those things? We have talked about that. He has already just
ScottCrocco: Sure. So first on pension. We expect to have a little bit of a drop this year versus last year on pension maybe for the year total pension expense. And so let me put it that way. Maybe it's like $30 million or so from an expense perspective. And by the way I know, Jeff, you've always interested in the cash flow statement. On contribution for the pension should be in the same line. So we think non cash expense versus contribution on the pensions to be about wash and call it $30 million and change. Then in terms of non-controlling interest. You are right that Lu'An was the biggest part of it, recognizing that we have, I think it was in the third quarter last year, we had a pure air adjustment that was a little bit of an anomaly because of the way that that arrangement was cancelled. I think in going forward we would expect to see, by the way the other, we also have a venture of the minority position over in Asia as well. So that's going to move around the non-controlling interest, but the biggest item in there is going to be Lu'An going forward.
JeffZekauskas: Was pension expense $90 million last year?
ScottCrocco: Including a bunch of the non-GAAP stuff that we had in there, I think, it was up about that that level. My comments here around kind of the ongoing underlying to be, it was a little bit lower than that, but and all in was with something that order.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
VincentAndrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask on the price-cost equation. As it was mentioned before you're down to sort of a negative $0.01 in the fiscal first quarter. Should we anticipate as we move to the balance of the year that price is going to exceed cost inflation or is it going to stay kind of the way things is?
SeifiGhasemi: That is our goal, Vincent.
VincentAndrews: Do you think you're going to achieve it?
SeifiGhasemi: We always want to see price increase and cost increase. That is our goal, yes.
VincentAndrews: Okay and if I could ask you on the dividend, and I'll preface this by noting that you have almost a 3% yield and your a dividend aristocrat, but the increase this year was a lot less than the last couple of years. And it's less than sort of the EPS growth that you're anticipating. So I'm just wondering if there's any particular reason the dividend increase wasn't larger.
SeifiGhasemi: Yes. We had promised the investors and we keep our promise that our dividends will be 2.5% to 3% of the stock price. And we right now increase the dividend to be at around 3%. So if next quarter the stock price goes up significantly, which obviously we hope so then we will increase the dividend. That is the guiding principle.
Operator: Steve Byrne of Bank of America.
SteveByrne: Yes, thank you. Is it reasonable to assume that the incremental EBITDA margin on Lu'An is well above 50% and would it have been even better if you had built the gasifier rather than buying it?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, Steve, how do you want me to answer that question without giving a lot of information to our competitors which is not necessary? Obviously, you are very right that the EBITDA margin on that business is over 50%. Actually a lot more than 50%, yes.
SteveByrne: And, Seifi, what drives the attractiveness of the gasifier that you have the intellectual property that gives you an edge?
SeifiGhasemi: Yes, absolutely. The fact that we owned the technology. We have inherited the people who know what the hell they are doing. And we were able to take over those gasifiers and run them very efficiently, run more efficiently than they were otherwise run. And that is why the profitability is higher because we are creating value for our partners. Because we are running that plant very efficiently and obviously as a result we are seeing the good results. Yes, owning the technology, owning the Shell technology is by far the biggest competitive advantage that we have. And also the GE technology and that is putting us in it two advantages. Number one, we know what they are doing and number two, owning these technologies is giving us visibility to projects way before everybody knows about it because if somebody is thinking about the project 10 years from now, the first thing they do as you know in the FEED study and all of that, they select the technology. Therefore, they talk to us, they before they even have a project or announce a project or issue a request for quotation. So we end up having a three, four, five year head start on our competitors.
SteveByrne: And this plant that was a forced shutdown in China by the government. Should we assume that was an older plant that didn't have a take or pay contract?
SeifiGhasemi: That plant, it was shutdown has nothing to do with gasification as you know. It's steel plant. It's a plant that they have been supplying oxygen to since 2005 and that plant was in middle of a city. So it is not a surprise that in time the city grows and therefore that plant either has to move or get shutdown. So right now that plant has been shutdown. We did have take or pay contract on that. But the take or pay contract, obviously, at the end of the day the plant is shutdown as force majeure, and you have to deal with that. But that's not a material part of our business. And in the future do we have other plants who are in the middle of cities that might be shutdown, smaller plant that can happen too. So nothing surprise at all.
Operator: Next we will hear from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners.
KevinMcCarthy: Yes, good morning. Seifi, you indicated that you are very confident in your ability to deploy capital into high return projects. Can you elaborate on that? Is it the case that you got such a target rich environment that even if macroeconomics don't cooperate you got plenty to choose from on the menu? And then second, can you give us an update on the Yankuang gasification project? And what the timing of that looks like these days.
SeifiGhasemi: Good morning, Kevin. Thank you very much for your good questions. Number one, with respect to opportunities. The opportunities that we are working on, these gasification project, they are not driven by the economy. They are driven by the strategic decision by countries like China, India, Indonesia, Uzbekistan and all of these other places to become independent of oil. They have the coal resources and they want to convert that to chemicals. So as a result, the reason I am very confident is because currently we are working on more than 52 of these projects. So if they all materialize, it would require $70 billion of investments. So we are -- we've positioned ourselves properly. We've chosen the technology. We have the people and we are well positioned and we have the cash to invest. And therefore, that is what makes me confident. And whatever happens to the economy, I think these countries will need to do these projects in order to become independent strategically from oil. So that -- with respect to the Yankuang project. That project is a huge project. It's about $12 million project. And we are working on that with Yankuang and trying to develop that. There are obviously environmental issues, investment issues and all of that. And we expect that project to be on a stream somewhere in around 2022. And we will give you an update as we go forward.
KevinMcCarthy: Okay. And secondly, if I may, can you talk about the modification of your contract in India? I imagined if you are moving to a tolling arrangement we should expect your sales to decline and your margins to rise. So that there is no net profit impact to your EMEA segment. I guess, a; is that correct? And b; if possible, maybe you can comment on some of those facts in terms of magnitude?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, first of all, you are analyzing absolutely correctly that when it becomes tolling change then the price of natural gas is not put into our sales. And therefore it will reduce our sales but improve our margin with no effect on the bottom line. The reason that has happened is that our partner in India had founded that if they do it that way it is beneficial to them from a tax point of view. And obviously from our point of view we still get the same BFC, it doesn't change. But in terms of the optics for the results, you are right. It decreases sales and increases their margins. Is that okay?
Operator: P. J. Juvekar of Citi has our next question.
P.J.Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning. So, Seifi, you got good merchant-on-merchant pricing. Can you just review merchant utilization rate around the world? I think last year you had mention that China utilization was close to 90%. Is that still the case? And this good pricing that you saw, which end markets or which industries were you able to raise prices to?
SeifiGhasemi: P J, first of all, if I may just go around the world. China, if you take all of China, their utilization rate is only about 56%-57%. But there are -- China is a very big country. There are pockets in China that there our utilization is about 90%-92% and that is what is giving us the pricing power. Utilization rates in Europe are still at around 75%-76% and the same thing is in the United States. But again even in Europe or in the US, there are pockets, as you know, industrial gases, the merchant business is very, very local. So we can be having another capacity in California but no capacity in Pennsylvania. So, we obviously analyze these things in detail and take action as appropriate. With respect to the end market, there is no specific end market that is driving this. It is just utilization of the plant in the specific geography that you are located.
P.J.Juvekar: Okay, thank you. And then secondly, Seifi, you haven't been buying back stock. And I know the preference is to invest in high return projects. But why not buyback some stock which gives you flexibility to take advantage of any market dislocation?
SeifiGhasemi: We are not buying stock and we don't plan to buy stock because we think, if you do the math, that you can do better than I do, if you have projects like Lu'An to invest, the return for the investors is a lot higher than us going and wasting that cash on giving money to a bunch of people who are going to go away and will not be a longer-term shareholder. So it is a very economic decision. If I think people who buy stock are people who have run out of steam in terms of growth. And therefore the only way that they can make shareholders happy is to announce stock buyback program. We have the opportunity to invest our money in projects that in the long term will generate or have a lot more value for our shareholders than buying back stock. And, as you know, I am a big shareholder and I am very passionate about this because I want to make money -- more money in the long term, not to get cash this afternoon and then disappear.
Operator: Next we will hear from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.
DuffyFischer: Yes, good morning, guys. Question just on Lu'An. Now that it is up and running for three months, how is it running? Number one. What lessons learned? Have you had from that? And then second one is just have you closed the GE deal yet?
SeifiGhasemi: So your first question and I don't want to jinx ourselves. So I am going to be knocking on with it little bit. The Lu'An project, the operation is going very well. All four gasifiers are running at capacity. Our customer has the need for the product. Their business is doing very well. They are taking all of the syngas and converting into chemicals and selling it and making money. So up to now it has been very positive. I am very, very, very proud of our team down there. We have something like 400 people working on this gasifier and running it everyday. And we have, as I've always been telling investors we know how to run process plants. If you run a hydrogen plant, you should be able to run a gasifier. But I have to say that the acquisition of the Shell technology and to having those people on our team has significantly helped us to be able to do that. So from that point of view it is -- we are doing very well. With respect to the GE, we have closed the GE, yes. And we are in the process of -- yes, thank you very much.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust.
JimSheehan: Thank you, good morning. What is your outlook for the LNG business in the second half of the year, please?
SeifiGhasemi: Jim, as you know, these -- our LNG business is the kind of business that you either get a big contract or you don't get a big contract. So I don't want to make too much of a prediction here but the signs are positive. That means that it is possible that we would be awarded some additional contracts. And that is one of the reasons that maybe we are little bit more optimistic about confirming our results. But these things are not done until they are done. There are a lot of projects on the drawing board as you know. And if anything happens we will obviously make appropriate announcement. But I have to say that I am more optimistic today than I was six months ago.
JimSheehan: Great. And in your full year guidance what are you guys assuming for the corporate segment, please?
SeifiGhasemi: In terms of what Jim?
JimSheehan: In terms of your incremental change from fiscal 2018 to 2019. Just trying to get some color on how to model the corporate segment.
SeifiGhasemi: Well, I think the corporate segment in terms of the cost of running the companies on a day to day basis are finance department, legal department, IT department and all of that. You know how we operate. You shouldn't expect much of a change there. I mean that is going to be steady with no significant increases. As far as any kind of plant sale that we might have that would show up in that sector or our LNG business and all of that, I think for your model assume flat and then anything that happens would be good news.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.
JohnRoberts: Thank you. Scott, for the $6.3 billion in commitments on page 15 or the approximate $7 billion on page 21 whichever one you want. Could you remind us roughly of the pace at which the cash will go out of the door and gets the commitment?
ScottCrocco: It's going to come, Hi, John, good morning. It's going to be coming in different method, so to speak, right. So if it is in -- if it is an asset buyback and that is going to come in big check. If it is a organic project, these are large particularly with big gasification projects the spending curve can be three, four years and so it will lumpy so to speak driven by the nature of the project itself. Whether it's an asset purchase or an organic.
SeifiGhasemi: But as a rule of thumb, I think you should assume, on this year we are saying we will spend about $2.5 billion. I think you should assume that in the next few years that number will go to about $3.5 billion every year.
JohnRoberts: Thank you. That's helpful. And then on Slide 13, the $0.06 unfavorable cost, Scott talked about lot things like technology, engineering, business development. Is that primarily in the Americas gases segment or is significant part of that over and global gases as well?
SeifiGhasemi: It is cost increases related to -- when we buy Shell technology, when we buy the technology GE; we get a lot of people. Our pursuing-- as I told you more than 50 gasification projects. So that's another almost a 100 people that you have to put in there in order to develop these projects. Those are the cost in terms of the section where you see that is, Scott --
ScottCrocco: That will be in corporate and then spread around depending on the nature of these costs that we are building our capability. But on the other item is the maintenance. The planned customer outages, so that's in that number as well and that's largely an Americas comments with the planned hike returns.
Operator: Next we will hear from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets.
JohnMcNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Seifi, you highlight a big backlog or at least potential backlog on gasification projects. And I know in the past you've targeted 10% returns on capital. As you become more evidently the kind of partner of choice you've got greater experience doing this. You've built up the technology. Do you see risk to the upside in terms of how to think about the returns on capital for future projects and how should we be thinking about?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, John, we have said that our minimum requirement is 10%, but if we can get a project at 25% we will do that. So I think your analysis is exactly correct that as we become the partner of choice, we should be able to command a higher price. And obviously there is other dynamic is that if our competitors are announcing $6 billion share buyback then I assume they don't have the money to compete in this project which would put us in a better position.
Operator: David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
DavidBegleiter: Thank you, good morning. Seifi, just on the merchant pricing, the Americas with the plus 4% are you seeing a competitor support for the pricing and has there been any impact from the Linde merger on pricing dynamics in the industry?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, first of all, the Linde merger is not close there, David, as you know. So there is certainly no impact from that. But, as you know, in general competitors pricing and so on, I have my lawyer looking at me and saying don't say anything considering the nature of the industry. So I apologize for not being able to comment on that. I shouldn't comment on that.
DavidBegleiter: Understood. And just on the guidance for you, Seifi, what do you need to do or see happen to get to the upper half of the guidance range for this year?
SeifiGhasemi: I think what would help us is a Lunar New Year shutdown in China which is normal rather than being longer. A stabilization of the discussions on Brexit and making sure that our business in UK doesn't suffer. And a better hopefully a few orders for the LNG that would help too.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Mike Sison of KeyBanc.
MikeSison: Hey, guys, nice quarter. You had mentioned that you feel confident Air Products can continue to grow at 10% annually for some time. Then you've talked positive about gasification. Is there a way to help us understand what of that 10% how much gasification can support in terms of growth over the next couple years?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, if all of the projects that we are talking about gasification actually materialized, and we deploy the capital that we are talking about, we will grow a lot better than 10%. If we look at the conventional industrial gas business worldwide and consider that that business will grow with the GDP worldwide, therefore you can't expect much more than 3% to 4% growth every year. So when we say 10%, we expect at least 6% from gasification and larger projects. But as I said, if we can actually implement and deploy the capital and have 10 more projects like Lu'An then we will grow a lot better than 10%.
MikeSison: Got it and then as a quick follow-up, if you had your choice which you probably do and you think about the capital deployment, is it preferable to spend all the capital on gasification versus historical ASUs and maybe talk about that concept going forward?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, I'm glad you asked the question. We remain totally committed to our core business. We are going to invest as much as we possibly can in our merchant business, in our standard gas generators, our hydrogen business and all of that. So the gasification is not taking anything away from that. We will be as aggressive and as you know enthusiastic in investing in our core business. Gasification is on top of that but the gasification is not going to take away from our focus on our normal business. We are not going to concede any market share anywhere in the world in our LOX/LIN, LAR business, our helium business, our hydrogen business. And we will invest in those businesses as appropriate. All we are saying is that those businesses fundamentally are not going to grow much better than GDP. And therefore you need to have another vehicle in order to meet our ambitious goal of delivering more than 10%. And we have found that vehicle to be gasification and very large projects.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global Securities.
MikeHarrison: Hi, good morning. Seifi, we've talked a little bit about the merchant business and you talked a little bit about utilization. I was wondering if you can talk about your approach to merchant capacity in North America. We've seen you announce some merchant ASUs in Ohio, New York, Minnesota. Any details on which end markets or customer dynamics are driving the need for more capacity? And what kind of utilization rates would you expect on those plants once they get up and running?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, Mike, that's a very good question. We remain committed as we has always been to make sure that our customers have access to competitive product. So the way we approach this thing is that, I mean, this is our business everyday. When we look at that area and we see that we are operating at 90% and the market is growing, we obviously go on build the merchant plant in order to make sure we can supply the market. And then when we see an area in like in Minnesota where there is a really very few competitors competing in there, and the market is growing then it is appropriate for us to go and build a plant. So our approach is focused on meeting the demands of our customers and making sure they have access to product.
MikeHarrison: All right. And then I was also hoping to get an update on the helium market. I know that you recently announced an agreement with Sonatrach in Algeria. Any comments on the growth or pricing dynamics you're seeing in helium.
SeifiGhasemi: Helium is obviously a very rare commodity. There are not that many places where you can produce it. And we are the largest helium producer in the world. So we are very committed again to meet the demands of our customers. And therefore we develop helium opportunities anywhere in the world that we can possibly do. We have been operating in Algeria for many years. And we saw an opportunity to be able to expand on our operation there and to make helium available to our customers. We are very proud that right now as we speak we are the only helium producer in the world who has not declared force majeure. I think we are very committed on that. We always make sure that we have supply for our customers. So the helium business is growing. There is significant amount of rocket launches that require helium. A significant amount of growth in medical use for MRI machines and all of that. And Air Products as the leader of the helium business worldwide is committed to make sure that we have product for our customers.
Operator: Lauren Alexander of Jefferies has our next question.
LaurenAlexander: Good morning. Just a quick one. Can you give a sense for how much your backlog has gone up excluding the gasification projects? Given the number of announcements that were made entering the quarter.
SeifiGhasemi: During a quarter it hasn't gone up that much because we haven't announced too many projects, but overall the backlog for our standard business is somewhere in the order of about $1.5 billion, and that hasn't changed significantly.
LaurenAlexander: Okay and for the commitments on the gasification side, are those at this point basically fixed or will you have some wiggle room in terms of project financing and other ways to maybe reduce the capital investment or the capital outlay by your products for the stakes?
SeifiGhasemi: We look at those --that issue on a project-by-project basis in terms of where it is and all of that. So, as you know, when we announced the Jazan, the big project in Saudi Arabia, we said that that project is going to be order of magnitude more than $8 billion and on that front we are going to use 40% equity and 60% project finance. So it's very much driven by the specific project and the nature of the project. But when it comes to a project like Jiutai in China, there the capital requirement is $700 million. We do that 100% corporate finance. It's very specific project driven. We have time for another question. We have significantly run over time. So can we one other question, please.
Operator: Absolutely. Our final question for today will come from Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein.
JonasOxgaard: Good morning, guys.
SeifiGhasemi: Hi. How are you?
JonasOxgaard: Oh, living the dream, everyday.
SeifiGhasemi: That's great. That's great. That's a good positive attitude.
JonasOxgaard: Thank you. So to go from that positive attitude to less positive question perhaps. If you can turn to that plant in China that you closed down. And whether the take or pay was voided by a force majeure. In the past when you talked about the gasification plants and the potential risks of China closing down gasification because of coal usage. The answer has always been the take or pays are there to protect us. So was there something unique about this particular one? Or how should I think about this in the grander context?
SeifiGhasemi: I think you shouldn't -- the two are not comparable. I mean the reason that the plant, that Gufang plant was shutdown was because it was in the middle of the city. The city is growing and obviously the steel plant is an older steel plant and it is not equipped with all of the latest technology. And it didn't have the money to do that. So the government shut them down. The gasification plants that we are building are not in populated areas. They are significant projects which are related through significant $10 billion, $12 billion investment for chemical production. And the possibility of those things being shutdown -- they are actually being built because they are environmentally friendly. So there is really kind of no comparison between the two.
JonasOxgaard: Okay. But if they were to be shutdown then the take or pays would be voided?
SeifiGhasemi: Well, my friend it's just like saying that if there is war in Venezuela they come and take over your plants like it has happened to Exxon before. So those are the kind of things that -- force majeure works both ways because we want to be protected that in case the government, we have a plant supplying steel plant and something goes wrong with our plant and they come and say, you can't operate. We can be liable to the customers to kind of supply them oxygen because we are under force majeure situation. Or when air compressor blows up in a plant which we have had situations like that, we declare force majeure so that we don't get sued by the customer for not supplying them oxygen to run their, or hydrogen to run their refineries. So that work both ways. So that's kind of standard in the contract.
JonasOxgaard: Okay, thank you. End of Q&A
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. With that, I'd like to thank everybody for being on the call. Thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule. And we appreciate your interest in our company. Thank you for the very good questions that allow us to kind of articulate our results. And we look forward to talking to you in next quarter with hopefully better results. Thank you very much.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products & Chemicals Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call, Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products fourth quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number 2. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. For the quarter and the year, the talented, committed, and motivated team at Air Products delivered another excellent set of safety and financial results. Our full year adjusted earnings per share of $7.45 is up 18%. This is the highest annual EPS in Air Products' history and our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Our record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2 is up $0.14 versus last year. I'd like to remind everybody that this is the 18th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year quarterly earnings per share growth. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with an EBITDA margin of about 35%. We have the strongest financial position in our industry. This allows us to continue to commit a significant amount of capital to grow Air Products into the future. We generated over $10 per share of distributable cash flow this year and returned about 40% of that or almost $900 million to our investors via dividend. Our team continues to prove their ability to execute the largest and most complex projects in the history of our industry, successfully completing mega projects in India, Saudi Arabia, China and the United States. And most importantly, we have a great team of dedicated, talented and committed people at Air Products who stay focused on working hard every day to serve our customers and create value for our shareholders. Now, please turn to slide number 3. We continue to improve our safety results with a reduction of 75% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 50% in our recordable injury rate. These results can only happen when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are committed to safety and continuous improvement. On slide number 4, you can see our goal for the company to be the safest, most diverse, and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers. Now, please turn to slide number 5. You can see our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times over the last four years. But it is worth repeating because we continue to be focused on shareholder value, capital allocation, and un-empowered and decentralized organization. Now, please turn to slide number 6. This is our updated Five-Point Plan that I have shared with you last quarter. We remain focused on sustaining our lead in safety and operational performance. We see tremendous opportunities to deploy capital in value-creating projects in our core industrial gas business primarily in our onsite business. Scott will take you through the numbers, but let me provide you a quick overview of our progress. In fiscal year 2018, we have spent about $1.5 billion on just the growth projects including M&A. In addition, we have more than $6 billion remaining to spend on our already committed future investment opportunity. You have heard Scott and I emphasized many times that we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted Aa2 rating. At that rating, we believe we have almost $14 billion remaining available to invest, including debt capacity today and investible cash flow over the next four years. So, we have already spent or committed about half of the total $15 billion available over the next five-year period of fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2022. This is great progress so far and I remain very confident, and I repeat, very confident of our ability to deploy the rest of this capital into high-return industrial gas projects that generate significant value for our shareholders. The fourth point of our plan is to continue to further improve our 4S culture, meaning safety, simplicity, speed, and self-confidence. And we are working to create an environment that our committed and motivated team brings that positive attitude and open minds to work every day. And finally, we do have a higher purpose to create an open and diverse environment for all of our people so that everyone feels that they belong and their contribution is valued. Let me be clear. This is Air Products' Five-Point Plan and remained and we remain focused on executing this strategy regardless of what others may do in our industry. Our goal is not to be the biggest but to be the best industrial gas company. Now, please turn to slide number 7 for a summary of our fiscal year accomplishments. I want to thank the very hardworking teams who have successfully executed some of the largest projects in the history of our industry. We completed the first year of operation of the large industrial gas complex for BPCL refinery in Kochi, India. This project took more than 10 million man hours to build and we did this without any safety incidents. The facility has successfully supplied hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and steam that enables BPCL to produce cleaner fuels. With this critical milestone as the largest air separation unit project in the history of our industry attained mechanical completion. The Jazan, Saudi Arabia air separation unit complex was completed with zero lost time injuries in 25 million man hours of work, a tremendous accomplishment by the team, particularly given the remote location and local climate challenges. Just to put that in context for you, that is equivalent to over 1,000 people working over 10 years with no lost time injury. We expect the six air separation units to come on stream in 2019. We successfully closed and started up the Lu'An, China air separation unit and gasifier joint venture, which has successfully been supplying syngas to Lu'An for their chemical production. The plant is fully operational, with all four gasifiers in service. This is a great accomplishment for our China team and I congratulate and thank them for a job well done. In June, we held the ribbon cutting event for our new world-class steam methane reformer in Baytown, Texas that provides CO and hydrogen to Covestro and other customers along our Gulf Coast pipeline network. It's great to see these projects starting up and contributing to our growth. But most importantly, it demonstrates to our customers and our employees that Air Products can be counted on to successfully deliver on our commitments, safely building and operating large complicated projects that provide critical gas supply to our customers. Our proven reliability and successful execution of these projects helped us to win additional projects in China, Korea, India, Louisiana and Texas for customers in the electronics, chemical and manufacturing markets. One of these is for Eastman in Kingsport, Tennessee, where we have been successfully supplying oxygen and nitrogen to their coal gasifiers for 35 years. We continue to commit to world-class engineering and technology resources where we need them around the world including Saudi Arabia, India and China. These are in addition to our existing engineering and technology capabilities in the U.S., U.K. and China. And in January, we announced a $0.15 dividend increase, the largest in the company's history. This 16% increase marks the 36th consecutive year Air Products has increased our dividend. In fiscal year 2018, we shared about 40% of our distributed cash flow or about $900 million with our investors via the dividend. And with our focus on creating our own growth opportunities, we continue to successfully execute on our gasification strategy. So please turn to the next slide, slide number 8. Gasification is a process that has been in existence for many years and Air Products has been involved in this market for many years. The process basically use oxygen plus coal, liquids or natural gas to produce synthetic gas which is in a combination of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This syngas can then be used to produce chemicals, diesel fuel, high-end olefins, polymers, hydrogen and/or power. Gasification has significant benefits that it enables an environmentally friendly way to use lower value feedstocks. Over the last few years, Air Products was successful in building very large air separation units to provide oxygen to customers operating their gasifiers in China and Saudi Arabia. Over the last year, we announced four large projects where Air Products will own and operate the gasifiers and syngas clean-up, and provide syngas or related products to our customers. The key is that these projects are consistent with our onsite business model, then we don't take any raw material or product volume or price risk. First, I mentioned the Lu'An project that is successfully supplying syngas to Lu'An for their chemical production. Second, in August, we announced the $8 billion gasifier power project in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, the same site where we just finished building the world's largest air separation unit complex. This project continues to move forward, and we continue to expect onstream late in calendar year 2019. Third, we continue to make great progress on the $3.5 billion air separation unit gasifier project to provide syngas to Yankuang in Shaanxi Province. We expect our ownership of the joint venture to be 55% to 60% with the project expected onstream in 2022. And finally, we also announced an agreement for the first 100% Air Products gasifier project to provide syngas to Juitai in China expected onstream in 2022. A key aspect of our strategy is the critical gasification technology. Please turn to slide number 9 for an overview of Air Products two gasification technologies. We have already seen the benefits of our acquisition and joint venture for the Shell solid and liquid gasification technology. This is the same technology being used in the Lu'An and Jazan gasifiers. This is a very well-proven technology with hundreds of gasifiers built over the last few decades. Another accompaniment is our recent announcement yesterday to acquire the GE gasification business and technology. The GE gasifier technology was originally developed by Texaco and also hundreds of units built over the last few years. We view these technologies as complementary. There are specific feedstock and product situation for which one technology or the other is better suited. These are technology acquisitions that put us in a better position to win the very large gasification onsite projects in the future. Now, please turn to slide number 10 which shows the results of our three key metrics for the quarter. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three key metrics. Now, please go to slide number 11, which has always been my favorite slide, showing that approximately 1,000 basis points improvement in our EBITDA margin in the last four years. Finally, please turn to slide number 12. Over the last four years, I have stressed the fact that we are committed to deliver at least 10% per year growth in our EPS over the long-term. You can see that we have actually delivered 14% compounded annual growth over the last four years. And this year, we delivered 18% growth. We will continue to execute our strategy that we believe will drive our EPS by at least 10% per year on average over the coming years. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now, please turn to slide 13 for our full year results from continuing operations. Sales of almost $9 billion increased 9% versus last year, primarily on 6% higher volumes and 1% higher price. We saw strong volume increases across all three regions, partially offset by lower activity from the Jazan project in Global Gases. Excluding Jazan, volumes were up 10%, with about half from new plants. Versus last year, pricing was up 1% primarily driven by our China and Europe merchant businesses. Positive currency was driven by the euro, British pound and the Chinese RMB. EBITDA of over $3.1 billion improved by 11%, driven by the higher volumes, positive pricing, currency, and equity affiliate income, partially offset by higher costs. Record EBITDA margin of 34.9% was up 70 basis points. Record adjusted earnings per share of $7.45 was up 18% versus prior year. ROCE of 12.4% improved 30 basis points versus last year. The impact on ROCE of our profit improvement is still moderated by the larger denominator which increased as a result of the gain from the PMD sale in early 2017. The FY 2018 denominator has the PMD gain in all five quarters, while FY 2017 only has three quarters with the PMD gain. Please turn to slide 14. Our record adjusted full year continuing operations EPS of $7.45 increased by $1.14 per share. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.71 per share. Price and raw materials taken together increased EPS by $0.16. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.45 as productivity was again offset by a few factors, including inflation, planned maintenance costs, and the end of the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. We also continue to see higher costs in strategic areas focused on pursuing exciting growth opportunities. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.16 favorable primarily due to the euro, British pound, and the Chinese RMB. Equity affiliate income added $0.15 primarily due to underlying operational strength in Mexico and Italy. The overall tax rate was a $0.44 benefit versus last year with about $0.33 from the new Tax Act. For both fiscal year 2019 and Q1 FY 2019, we expect a tax rate of about 20%. Finally, we had other items that combined for a positive $0.02. This includes $0.08 from higher non-operating income primarily from higher interest income. This was somewhat offset by $0.03 higher interest and a $0.03 impact from higher shares outstanding. Now, please turn to slide 15. We had a very strong cash flow year with over $10 per share or $2.2 billion of distributable cash flow which is up over $300 million from prior year. From a $2.2 billion of distributable cash flow, we paid almost $900 million or about 40% as dividends. Even with this robust dividend, we still have over $1.3 billion available for high-return investments in our core industrial gas business. Slide number 16 provides an update on our capital deployment, as Seifi previously mentioned. We are making it easier for investors to understand how much we have spent, how much we have committed, and how much remained of our capital deployment capacity. The first point is that we are tracking capital deployment over the five-year period of FY 2018 through FY 2022. As you can see, we spent about $1.5 billion on growth projects including M&A but excluding maintenance capital. In addition, we have committed but not yet spent almost $6.5 billion on projects in M&A. You've heard both Seifi and I emphasized many times the importance of managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted Aa2 rating. If we maintain this rating at a debt level of about 3 times the last 12 months EBITDA, we have about $8.5 billion available to invest today. And based on the last 12 months investable cash flow, we expect to have at least $5.5 billion over the next four years. Therefore, in total, we have almost $14 billion remaining to invest. The $1.5 billion we have spent this year and the $14 billion available gives us over $15 billion of total available capacity from FY 2018 through FY 2022. So, you can see we have spent about 10% and committed about half of the total available capacity. Turning to slide 17, I'll make a few comments on our quarterly results. Sales of $2.3 billion increased 4% versus last year as volumes are up 3% and price contributed 1%. We saw strong volume increases in Americas and Asia, partially offset by lower activity from the Jazan project in Global Gases. Excluding Jazan, volumes were up 6%, with about 3% from new plants primarily driven by the Lu'An project. Versus last year, pricing impacted our overall sales by a positive 1% primarily driven by China. Pricing changes are driven by our merchant business where we saw a 3% increase. EBITDA of $822 million improved by 7% driven by the higher volumes and equity affiliate income, partially offset by higher costs. EBITDA margin of 35.8% was up 90 basis points driven by the higher volume. Record adjusted quarterly continuing operations EPS of $2 per share was up 14% versus prior year. Please turn to slide 18. Our adjusted EPS of $2 increased by $0.24. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.23 per share. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.16, as productivity was again offset by a few factors. In addition to the ones that I had mentioned during my full year comments, we also saw higher supply chain costs in the Americas and Asia. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 primarily due to the underlying operating strength in Mexico and Italy. The overall tax rate was a $0.15 benefit versus last year. You can also see we had several non-GAAP items that totaled to $0.05 benefit for the quarter. These included a pension settlement, a valuation change due to a change in inventory accounting policy, and a few tax reform related items. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to slide number 19 Gases Asia where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth, thanks to the efforts of our excellent and committed team in Asia. Sales increased 15% versus last year driven by very strong volume growth and higher prices. Volumes were up 14%, with new projects there driving about 10% of the increase, while base business and acquisitions are roughly equal to the rest. Lu'An was a significant contributor this quarter responsible for about half of the total sales growth. Pricing for the region was up 3% versus last year, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement. This also marked a 2% sequential increase from the prior quarter showing the continuing strength in this region's merchant market primarily in China. Strong base volumes, the addition of Lu'An and favorable pricing drove profits and margins higher. EBITDA increased over 20% and EBITDA margin improved 210 basis points compared to prior year. Consistent with our prior guidance, Lu'An contributed about $0.04 of EPS this quarter. As I said, we are pleased that all four gasifier trains have come on stream and expect Lu'An to contribute more than $0.25 earnings per share in fiscal year 2019. We continue to believe that our business in China will improve in the coming year, and we have not seen any negative impact as a result of the imposed tariffs. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Scott to discuss our Americas results. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to slide 20 for a review of our Gases Americas results. For the quarter, sales grew 4% on higher volumes and price. Volumes improved 4% as both onsite and merchant volumes were strong. Our new plant in Baytown, Texas supported increased hydrogen demand on the Gulf Coast. Merchant volumes also grew despite the termination of a wholesale contract in Q4 of FY 2017. Overall price was 1% higher which is our first positive pricing result in the last six quarters. Americas EBITDA was roughly equal to prior year as improved volume and price, as well as higher equity affiliate income due to better results in Mexico were offset by increased costs. While we did have positive productivity, this was more than offset by higher power costs, and we no longer have the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. We saw higher transportation costs in part due to driver shortages. Finally, the difficult business environment in South America negatively impacted our ability to collect from certain customers. As a result, EBITDA margin was down 160 basis points. Sequentially, sales and EBITDA both improved 4%. Strong volumes grew higher sales and EBITDA was further supported by lower cost as maintenance activities were lower this quarter. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to slide 21 for a review of our Gases EMEA results. Sales were up 8% primarily driven by a 7% higher energy pass-through mostly due to a significant increase in natural gas prices in India. Volumes contributed a positive 2% due to merchant growth as well as recent acquisitions. Higher merchant pricing added another 1%. Improved merchant markets lifted both price and volume in our packaged gases and liquid bulk businesses. As a reminder, the India plant was fully on stream in Q4 last year so there was no year-over-year benefit in Q4 this year. EBITDA declined 5% as unfavorable currency and higher cost negated the positive pricing effect and better equity affiliate performance in Italy. Power costs in Europe have risen sharply during the quarter and our team is working hard to recover these higher costs through pricing actions. EBITDA margin was 31.4%, a drop of 410 basis points. Excluding the impact of higher energy pass-through, EBITDA margin was down 180 basis points primarily due to the higher power costs. Sequentially, EBITDA margin was down but would have been nearly flat excluding the higher energy pass-through. Now, please turn to slide 22 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. EBITDA was flat although sales were down due to lower project activity as we approach the conclusion of the Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. We continue to expect the Jazan ASU project on stream in phases in fiscal 2019. But we do expect the Jazan ASU overall to be a headwind for FY 2019 versus FY 2018. Now, please turn to slide 23 for a brief comment on our Corporate segment which includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales increased modestly compared to prior year as we began to see renewed interest in LNG projects. Overall segment profit was up due to additional equipment sales and lower costs. We continue to be optimistic about the future prospects for the LNG business but only anticipate a modest earnings improvement in FY 2019. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon. Our team around the world, all of us, continued to be very excited about Air Products future. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation for our continued growth. And our Five-Point Plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward. As I said before, we have the financial capacity, the opportunities and the team to successfully win key growth projects. There is no doubt that there is uncertainty in the world. I guess that's an understatement. And while we cannot predict or control worldwide political or economic developments, we do have control over the operational performance and growth of Air Products and we are confident we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have made. Let me address what we are seeing relative to global trade relationships and tariffs. Very simply, we have not, and I stress, not seen any material impact on Air Products at this point. Our business is local so we don't have any direct exposure to import/export tariffs. Also, we have not seen customers changing their behavior or attitude toward us and we have not seen any impact on our major projects or interaction with customers in the different parts of the world. Now, please turn to slide number 24. We are all working hard every day to be the safest, most diverse, and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Our guidance for fiscal year 2019 is for a range of $8.05 to $8.30. At midpoint, our guidance represents 10% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2018 performance. As I said, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment to grow EPS by more than 10% per year on average in the future. For quarter one of fiscal year 2019, our earnings per share guidance is $1.85 to $1.90. At midpoint, up 5% over last year. But I would like to remind you that in quarter one of fiscal year 2018, there was an $0.08 benefit from a plant sale in Asia that will not repeat. Excluding this item, our quarter one guidance is up 10% versus prior year. We expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2019. We expect the Jazan gasification power joint venture to close late in calendar 2019, so we have not included this in our fiscal 2019 CapEx forecast. You can also see we have about $7 billion of commitments including projects and M&A. This is up significantly as it now includes the Jazan, Yankuang, Juitai gasification projects. And then, please turn to slide number 25. As always, our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. That is what allows us to continue to generate our superior safety and operational performance. I want to thank all of our 15,000 people around the world for their total commitment and hard work and for embracing the opportunities in front of us with energy and a spirit of working together.

Our Five-Point is our strategy. Our people's execution against this strategy in the years to come will ensure our continued success and value creation. Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: And we'll take our first question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, P.J. How are you this morning?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good. In Americas and Europe, the leverage from sales growth doesn't seem to be coming down to the EBITDA line. Last quarter, it was maintenance cost. This quarter, I think you mentioned high power cost. When can we begin to see the leverage flowing to the EBITDA line?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, first of all, you are absolutely correct that the margins are – kind of the marginal contribution has been coming down. You mentioned the reasons very accurately in Americas which is a combination of a lot of things, hydrogen turnarounds, driver shortages, and a lot of other things that I can delineate for you. And in Europe, we have had a significant issue with power cost that we haven't been able to recover. We are working very hard and we are hoping that we would reverse these trends in 2019.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then quickly on merchant utilization, can you compare them around the world? Now that you are getting pricing in each region, what are we seeing in terms of utilization in each region?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Overall, our utilization in Europe is still around 78%, 79%. In the U.S., it is approximately the same. In China, it obviously differs from different parts of China. There are part of China where our utilization is almost 90% and that is what is helping us to drive the prices up.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, P.J.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: (39:43-39:49) year-over-year variance in how you drove your EPS growth. As we look into 2019, I think you mentioned Jazan would be a headwind. I don't suspect tax will be as big of a tailwind and maybe exiting the fourth quarter of the U.S. and the Americas and EMEA were not that growing so much. So, can you give us a sense of what those buckets would look like that drive that pretty significant EPS growth you see in 2019?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: What, the main reasons – first of all, good morning, Bob. The main drivers for increasing our EBITDA significantly next year, and as you say, we are suggesting about 10%. But I mean that is actually more than that if you take away the effect of the tax thing. But fundamentally, the drivers are our growth projects that are coming onstream in China, in India, in the U.S. So – and then, we are hoping that there are some other projects that we haven't announced would materialize. And then in addition to that, we are hoping that the utilization rates will maybe improve slightly in China. I don't know about how it will work out in the U.S. because, as you know, manufacturing in the last six months in the U.S. has actually gone down. And so those are the factors. And then in addition, Bob, I have to say that I'm not that excited about our performance on cost last year, and I'm hoping that we will have additional productivity and cost improvement programs that would help deliver the results.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And if I might follow up, Seifi, you guys had about a 1% price improvement this year. Can you give us some sense of what you might see in fiscal 2019?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, Bob, first of all, the 1%, I'm sure you know that the 1% is over our total portfolio. So since half of our portfolio is onsites where we don't get any price increase, therefore, the price increase on our merchant side is really 2%. But as far as the future, because of the nature of our industry, I would hesitate to make any comment on that.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Bob.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff. How are you this morning?
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Very fine. How do you think the Praxair-Linde merger will change the industrial gas landscape or perhaps will change the opportunities for Air Products in the coming year?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, Jeff, I'm obviously very hesitant to make any comments about other people's business. But as I said during my comments, we do not expect any change in our strategy. We have said that publicly and I recently put out a memo to our own people. We had a strategy, we are executing that strategy and quite frankly, I do not see any change or any reason for change as a result of the merger because the merger hasn't really changed anything. It's just a little bit moving the pieces on the chessboard. So we do not – and in terms of opportunities, actually, we think that that might enhance opportunities for us because usually, there is a customer who was going to divide their business by four, giving each one of us 25%, now, they will divide it by three, and therefore, we will get more share and the other guys will get less share. So, we actually think that overall, as I said, no change in terms of what we do and if anything, it's slightly positive.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Can you compare what you've paid for the GE technology business to what you've paid for that Shell business? And what are the annual revenues of the GE business and what were the annual revenues of the Shell business?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, on both of those things, we have an agreement with both Shell and GE not to disclose those numbers. I would have not minded disclosing them, but they don't want to do that. And in terms of what we paid for them, let's just say a general thing, that's approximately similar.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Seifi said before, the value creation of those acquisitions is much more about the ability to be in a better position for the big onsite projects than the specifics associated with the technology licensing revenues.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Absolutely. Because we bought the business for – and the Shell business, the acquisition of that has given us significant advantage in knowing the future projects that might happen. So, that has been a very successful thing, and I'm very happy that we've been able to reach an agreement with GE. It took a very long time. But they have an excellent technology, it's the former Texaco technology. I'm very familiar with that. I was trying to promote that in the 1990s with Foster Wheeler to try to get BOC in that business, but that didn't happen. So, I'm very pleased that we were able to acquire that. Thank you, Jeff.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We will take our next question from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. On the GE gasification business, I guess when you think about how much it potentially expands your addressable market, is that the right way to think about it. And if it is, how much does that help when you kind of bundle that in with the Shell platform as well?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: First of all, good morning, John. And secondly, it almost doubles because GE and Shell technologies are approximately equal weight in terms of what is being used. And therefore, it literally doubles the exposure that we have and our ability to promote that technology. And obviously, if we have the technology for a gasifier, our chances of building and owning and operating that gasifier significantly increases.
John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thanks. And then just a question, you had announced a couple of – I guess a couple of new projects during the quarter, the Kingsport facilities and also the, I believe, it was liquid helium platform as well. I guess can you help us to understand how to think about the earnings power on those? I guess the ones tied to Eastman sounds like they're more replacement project, so if you can kind of help us to think about how to quantify that that would be helpful.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure, John. And John, first of all, Eastman coal gasification project, it is more than replacement. It is actually – there is some additional volumes that they will need. But that will contribute to our earnings about two years from now once – after we have built the plant. And in terms of the other things, we also announced Juitai, which is a big project about $600 million investment and that is going to come on stream on 2021.
John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Vincent. How are you?
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'm very well. Thank you, Seifi. Another question on the GE gasification technology, the slide talks about adaptable to a wide range of feedstocks. Maybe you could just help us understand sort of what the principal wide range of feedstocks is in there and maybe again how that expands your palate?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: The principal applications on that is in coal and natural gas gasification. They have an excellent technology for that. And the technology is related to the quality of the coal, the ash content of the coal whether you use a slurry system and all that. And that is why we were keen to have both Shell and GE because then we can tailor make it to the specific situation that the customers have.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, you're referencing South America an inability to collect on payments. Is that a function of customers being below minimum take or pay or is that a separate type of issue?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: It's just the issue of some customers going bankrupt...
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Ah, okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: ...which have been plenty of them.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And our merchant business (48:42)
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We have very little onsite down South America.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Right.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. So, you've recently been seeing more positive in projects in the U.S. and India and always the Middle East for obvious reasons. But just given the remaining plus or minus $8.5 billion left to deploy over the next few years in these projects and these geographies, are the recent acquisitions, I mean obviously Shell and GE were both very intentional. Are they complementary and is there anything that you're attempting to triangulate for the ongoing bidding processes of these potential projects, or are there other technologies you still feel you would need to acquire?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I don't want to comment on the second part but first of all, good morning, Chris.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Second thing is that when you look at the GE technology, GE technology has been chosen actually for some very big projects in India. Some of it has been publicly announced. So that, I think, is giving us an opportunity. And then obviously, we are looking forward to deploying some of these for projects in the U.S., absolutely.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And just given the volatility of the electricity rates in Europe and just broadly, can you just give us the puts and takes of the merchant market and kind of how you're thinking about that not only over the next quarter but over the next year and what you're hearing from your team there? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the thing is that our teams are obviously optimistic but they are in no position to predict what happens to Brexit or what happens to the elections tonight in the U.S. So we are at the mercy of industrial production. GDP really doesn't mean very much to our business because it includes financial activity and people going out to dinner. We are focused on industrial production and that we have given you the guidance on the basis of – they have been a little bit conservative. We don't see significant improvements. So now, if for some magic reason things significantly improve, we'll benefit from that but we have been on the cautious side.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. This is Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Hi, Mike.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Seifi, could you maybe expand on the synergies of having both GE and Shell's gasification technology and what I mean by that is in your mind, does having both technologies provide you with a meaningful bidding advantage versus saying having one or the other so, sort of a one-plus-one-equals-three-type equation? Just how should we think about the complementary nature of these?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, just think of a situation, if there are 10 projects and half of them are using Shell and half of them are using GE, by owning the GE technology, now we have an opportunity to participate in all 10 rather than 5 of them. So, it is complementary, and it does expand our scope. It's actually a very positive thing, Mike.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one for Scott, could you just remind us on how the P&L impact shifts for the Jazan ASUs as the project is complete and we start to ramp that up in 2019?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: So, yes. Thanks for the question. So, in terms of Jazan, two parts, there's the SOE that we've been doing over the last couple of years. That's – as Seifi mentioned I think in the prepared remarks, that's wrapping up here in the next year. And so, you'll see that as a headwind and again, I think Seifi addressed that earlier. Then, our 25% that we own for the long-term supply contract is going to be an equity affiliate, and it's going to be a very, very small contribution. So, not much in there going forward from that portion of the Jazan opportunity.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Can I just add? But that is for the air separation unit part. That means basically, we are saying that you are not going to see a lot of – actually, you're going to see a headwind from the air separation part in 2019. But the gasifier part is the big part and that one is going to be a significant contribution in 2020 after we close it in 2019.
Michael Leithead - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, Seifi. How are you?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I'm fine, David. I haven't seen you for a while. How is everything?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. Thank you. Seifi, just looking at your large project activity, could you work around your key regions; China, India, the Middle East, and the U.S., talk about the pace and cadence of activity that you're seeing today?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. We see significant opportunities still in the U.S. Some of these projects were delayed but there are other projects in the U.S., whether they are methanol projects, whether they are ammonia projects and all of that. We are obviously involved in all of them and I hope they materialize because as you know, our preference, if the opportunities exist, that we would invest all of our $15 billion in the US. I mean that goes without saying, this is the place – our home base and this is where we want to invest. So we see still opportunities in the U.S. Then there are significant, and I mean significant opportunities in China. They are – there's more projects than we can handle quite honestly right now. There is – starting to have significant opportunities in India because of the change in the law that they had about coal ownership. So a lot of people are participating in that and there was a big announcement about the fertilizer project which is gasification in India and all of that. So we're seeing that. In Saudi Arabia, you have seen the opportunities and we believe that there will be opportunities in other parts of the world. I don't want to be that specific but the pipeline is pretty robust and with us being on top of both technologies which are the key technologies being used, I think we should have a competitive advantage. Obviously, time will tell and the results will back up what we are claiming, but we remain very optimistic.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And Scott, following up Bob's earlier question on the 2019 earnings bridge, you have about a $0.75 forecast of increase. Could you just, broadly speaking, break out that $0.75 bridge between 2019 and 2018, if possible?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, we don't give out all the specifics. I think though Seifi in his comments talked about the new on streams, the full year impact, as well as new things coming on stream, and hopefully favorable volume growth and pricing, so forth. Let me add a couple of things. Tax as well as currency. So we see, as I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks, 20% effective tax rate book for next year, which would translate into about a $0.10 headwind. And it's really driven by the absence of some favorable things, some favorable tax audit settlements we had in this year. So, that's part of the bridge into 2019. The other is currency and we see somewhere on the order of about a $0.10 to $0.15 headwind on currency. And just recall the way that we look at this, we just take the last data points on currency and then just move that sideways through the year as opposed to try to project where rates are going to go. Let me give you, so everybody can have their own view where currency is going to go and again our view is at this point in time it's about $0.10 to $0.15. Let me give you the rules of thumb that you can apply to whatever your own assumptions are. So if we move the RMB by 10% and as always, I want to remind folks this is just mathematics, right? It's just translation. There's no transaction in there. So, if you move the RMB by 10% that translates into about a $0.12 change for the year. The euro same 10% swing and in exchange would be about $0.09. And then there's a handful of other ones that each of which are about $0.03 to $0.04 that includes the pound and the Korean won, Taiwanese dollar and the Canadian dollar. So, each of those individually if the exchange moves about 10% to be $0.03 to $0.04 on an annual basis and what I've just given there plus the U.S. sales is about 90% of our sales. So, hopefully that's helpful. So, you can put it in your models.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, David.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thank you. Would you characterize the number of coal gasification projects under consideration in China including refurbishment of old gasifiers as being in the neighborhood of a few or more likely a few dozen?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: How about like 50?
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And to the extent that the new plants are much more efficient than the old ones, what's the role of the Chinese government in any of these? Are they providing any support financing wise or streamlined regulatory path?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Most of these companies that are doing this are state-owned anyway. So, they are 100% owned by the government. Therefore, as they invest, they obviously have the support of the government.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just lastly, your outlook for incremental demand growth for hydrogen on the U.S. Gulf from IMO 2020?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes, we expect that. I think that the industry has not acted because they are hoping that they would get some help from the White House and delay the implementation. But I don't know where that will go. But in Europe, people are pretty serious about implementing in that in the rest of the world. And we will, in time, see significant demand but, as I said, it hasn't really happened in the U.S. right now. It will take about three years before this thing – any new plan comes onstream. And I think most of the people here are thinking that at the end of the day, this will become like the auto emission thing. They wait until the last minute, nobody does anything and then we kind of say, okay, we delay it another four or five years. That's what the industry is hoping but I have no insight in terms of what the administration will do.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Don. How are you doing?
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Very good. Thanks. Couple questions. One, you talked about a slowing base business outlook. I noticed your growth for the full year was 10% ex-Jazan, it slowed to 6% ex-Jazan in Q4. Was that all due to the slowdown in global industrial production? And what's your specific industrial production forecast for your fiscal 2019 guidance?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the first question – I think Simon had a quick answer for that.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Just remember, of course, that we didn't have any year-over-year volume benefit from the big plant in India this quarter and the prior four quarters we did. So that slows the comparator down.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Exactly. So it's the effect of the plant in India coming onstream. So we haven't really seen any slowdown in that respect. In terms of industrial production, Don, I mean you are more of an expert on this than any one of us here. I mean, we can't predict what's going to happen tomorrow. So you can ask me, I mean, what I can answer is that in terms of our guidance, the way we have come up with the guidance is that we have assumed that there will be no significant uptick, but at the same time, no significant downtick. So we are expecting or we are giving you our guidance based on the fact that things will stay about the same. So if there is any significant change up or down, then obviously we'll be affected by that.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And on the cost side, both in Europe with power and North America with supply chain, do you have the ability to surcharge for those two specific items? And if not, how do you expect to address those costs in fiscal 2019?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, we theoretically have the ability and I always every day challenge our people to use that ability and the contractual ability to increase the prices. But it obviously depends on what our competitors do. But those are the challenges that we have to face in 2019. And the way we have given you the guidance is that we have assumed that we will overcome those challenges.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Don.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Forget if you mentioned it, but are you a major oxygen supplier to many of these GE gasification locations?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: The existing ones, I think we are by far the most major supplier in terms of sale of gas, yes. But a lot of these projects that I'm talking about in the future obviously they haven't been built. But...
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Right. But how many existing gasifiers do you supply oxygen to?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We supply to about at least eight of them.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Eight?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: But some of them have four or five units, so...
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. So, eight.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We supply more than 100,000 ton a day of oxygen to these people.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then, Praxair-Linde still have some divestments coming post closing assets in Korea and neon in the U.S.. I assume you would not be allowed to bid for those but I just wanted to check.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We are not counting on it at all. That's correct.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Hey. How are you?
Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: I am great. Two-part question, if you will. On yet another two on the coal gasification here. I was wondering if this also means a research push from you guys on developing better, more efficient, cleaner, et cetera. And if we could see an uptick in R&D spend as a result. And then the second question on the same topic here is my understanding was that the GE Shenhua venture was the provider of practically all the GE licensed gasifiers in China. How does that JV fit into with your plans of going into the gasification in China?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Great questions. First of all, your first question. Yes, it does mean that we are going to spend more on R&D. That is one of the reasons that you see a negative costing in 2018 performance. That's very true and we are committed to make sure that we provide the support for these technologies to improve forward. The other thing is that we are now, in China, a partner with Shenhua. That means that the way we bought this thing, we bought all the rights to the GE gasifiers outside China, it's all 100% ours. And in China, we are partner with Shenhua which is now called, China Energy Corporation. So, we are their partners.
Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. How does that partnership interact with your strategy of becoming the builder/operator of these gasification units?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: It does significantly help because hopefully, they will bond to those new gasifiers and all of that and now, we are – I mean China Energy Corporation is one of the largest companies in the world. They are operating about, I think, at least 10 gasifiers in China, most of them do use GE technology, and they have plans for the future. So, we are very, very honored and happy to be a partner with the China Energy Corporation, former Shenhua.
Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Mike. How are you doing today?
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Doing well. Thanks, Seifi. Just going back to the EU, the European power cost situation. You've dealt with this fairly recently in the past, you seem to have managed through it, and now we're getting hit with what you called another surge. Can you quantify how much impact you saw this quarter and is it something that's carrying into Q4 and the fact that you dealt with these cost increases pretty recently, does that make it any easier to maybe pass this through to customers or get additional pricing?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, Mike, it's a very good question. Obviously, power costs are going to go up in Europe because I mean, you pay a price if you want clean energy and you don't want to use a nuclear power plants. Therefore, the cost of renewable energy and all of that is higher. The issue that they have with this power cost and all of that is that when they happen we have a program we understand how to increase prices to recover that which is not easy, but there is a delay factor. So, when it happens in a quarter, we are not going to instantly be able to recover that in the same quarter. So, usually we have an impact on the quarter and then one or two quarters later on, we have increased the prices and we recover that. So, there is a little bit of a phasing here.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Understood. And then another question regarding the competitive environment. You talked a little bit about the change related to four major players now becoming three but we also have had some divestitures to call them somewhat smaller players that are going to make those two competitors a little bit bigger. Do you see them having a significant impact on the – in particular the merchant gas competitive landscape over the next couple of years?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, again, I mean, what do you want me to say? In terms of competitors, we consider we have two competitors. The rest of them are companies. We don't consider them competitors.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. Just two quick clarifications. The only capital outlay for the gasification this year will be the Jazan investment. Is that right or more of that $7 billion pipeline get pulled into 2019? And secondly, just comparing pages 16 and 24, it looks like you're calling out about $600 million of M&A. Is that future M&A related to bolt-ons or the captivation or is that including the gasification acquisitions?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, first of all, with respect to the first question that you had, let me put this thing in context because we are very careful about how we talk about these things. When we talk about M&A, that includes buying a company or it includes the captivation, so we expect that. The second thing is that in terms of spending money, for example, Juitai, we signed the contract last year $600 million. We are going to spend capital on building that plant obviously tomorrow and some other projects that they have won. So, that is why our capital expenditure for next year, we are giving you a guidance of $2 billion to $2.5 billion which is almost $1 billion more than this year, which is spending money on the projects we have won so that they come on stream in 2020 and 2021.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Just to clarify one thing we did say the Jazan gasifier project is not included in our capital guidance. As Seifi said, we expect that to close late in 2019.And just one more point to make too is that on one of the slides, we're showing the remaining capital to spend on our commitments and the other one we're showing the total amount. So, I think that's the difference that you're talking about there.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Laurence. Okay. And we have time for one more question. Yeah.
Operator: Perfect. We'll take our last question from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. This is Pete Osterland on for Jim.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Hi.
Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: In Asia, you called out volume growth from Lu'An as well as pricing strength in the merchant market. And I'm just trying to size, can you estimate how much of the EBITDA margin uplift that you experienced during the quarter was due to each of these?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the thing is that we said that half of our growth – I mean we have specifically said that Lu'An contributed $0.04 to our bottom line. So, that's about $12 million approximately.
Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And then merchant growth is basically – then we had some other projects coming on stream in addition to Lu'An. And then the merchant volume was about maybe 40% of the increase.
Peter Osterland - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We do appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day. Have a nice holidays and all the best. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Vicky. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products third quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sean Major, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number 2. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. We certainly do appreciate your interest in Air Products. The talented, committed, and motivated team at Air Products delivered another excellent set of safety and financial results. Our record adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 is up 18% versus last year. This is the 17th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth and the fifth consecutive quarter we have delivered year-on-year EPS growth of more than 15%. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with a record quarterly EBITDA margin of over 36%. We continue to generate significant cash, which supports our robust dividend policy. And we do have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, which gives us the ability to commit a significant amount of capital to grow Air Products in the coming years. And most important, we have a great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented, and committed people at Air Products, who have stayed focused on working hard every day to serve our customers and create value for our shareholders. Now, please turn to slide number 3. We continue to improve our safety results with a reduction of 67% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 52% in our recordable injury rate. These results can only happen when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are committed to safety and continuous improvement. On slide number 4, you can see our goal for the company, to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. And I want to emphasize that the most diverse in our goal refers to our people. We value a diverse workforce. Now, please turn to slide number 5. You can see our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times over the last four years. But it is worth repeating because we continue to be focused on shareholder value, capital allocation, and an empowered and decentralized organization. Now, please turn to slide number 6. It was almost four years ago that I shared our original Five-Point Plan: we have successfully focused on Air Products' core industrial gases business; we have restructured the organization; changed the culture; controlled capital and costs; and aligned our rewards. We have done what we promised to do. Now, please turn to the slide number 7. Our journey is never complete, and it's time to evolve our Five-Point Plan to guide us over the coming years. Let me explain each of the points on this slide one at a time. First, from the left side, in terms of sustaining our lead, we will keep our focus on safety. We have done well, but even one injury is too many. Accidents don't happen by themselves. Every incident or accident is preventable. We want to be the best-in-class in everything we do. We need to be the best-in-class operationally, for example, to make sure our plants are running all the time. The same thing with our human resource processes, financial processes, safety processes. Everything that we do, we should aim to, and we will be, the very best in the industry. And productivity, we obviously need to continue to focus on productivity to maintain our margins. Second, in terms of deployment of capital, as you have heard me say before, we believe that we have at least $15 billion of capital to commit over the next five years. This includes cash and debt capacity available today and the investable cash flow we expect to generate in the next five years. I remain very confident – and I like to repeat this – I remain very confident that we will be able to commit the full $15 billion to very high-quality industrial gas projects over the next five years. It is obviously to know exactly what will be the breakdown of the $15 billion, but based on our view today, I could see something approximately $1.5 billion for acquisitions of industrial gas companies; $2.5 billion for asset buybacks, $4 billion for traditional industrial gas projects such as new liquid oxygen and nitrogen plants, packaged gas depots, high purity nitrogen generators, and smaller-scale oxygen and nitrogen plants, and then about $7 billion for large-scale energy, environmental, and emerging market projects, including coal gasification. We continue to execute on our overall growth strategy, acquiring the Shell gasification technology and closing on the Lu'An project in the past quarter. The third point is the evolution of our portfolio. Most of the types of the projects I mentioned before are in our onsite business. These are the very large projects around the world. To be clear, we do intend to continue investing in our merchant business when we see good opportunities to invest in liquid capacity around the world. And the same goes for packaged gas opportunities in locations where we are already in that business. However, given the relative size and number of onsite opportunities, I expect the onsite portion of our portfolio will grow faster, which means more of Air Products will be the onsite business in the future. This is good because the onsite business is very stable during the ups and downs of the economic cycle around the world. Fourth, in terms of changing the culture, this remains a focus of our original Five-Point Plan that requires more work. We have to continue to improve our 4S culture, meaning safety, simplicity, speed, and self-confidence. We will work to further build a committed, diverse and motivated team that brings their positive attitudes and open minds to work every day. And finally, on the last point on the chart on the right, at Air Products, we do have a higher purpose in addition to creating value for our shareholders. The higher purpose is to create an open and diverse environment for all of our people so that everyone feels that they belong and their contribution is recognized. In addition, all of us at Air Products are committed to make good products that benefit all humanity. And we certainly are committed to sustainability. In summary, at Air Products, we do want to do more than just making money. As I said, we are proud of what we have accomplished with our original Five-Point Plan and are confident that we will continue to deliver with our updated Five-Point Plan as delineated on this slide number 7. Now please go to slide number 8, which shows the result of our three key metrics for the quarter. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three key metrics. Now please go to slide number 9. Since I started as the Chairman, President, and CEO of Air Products more than four years ago, I have stressed the fact that we are committed to deliver at least 10% per year growth on our EPS over the long term. You can see that we have delivered better than that in the last four years. And we will continue to pursue strategies which will drive our EPS by at least 10% over the coming years. We are very committed to that. Finally, please turn to slide number 10, which is always my favorite slide, especially this quarter. It is great to see our record margin of 36.3% and the progress we have made over the last few years. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I review our results, I want to provide an update on our external independent auditors. Air Products has had a long and productive audit relationship with KPMG since 2002. Given their tenure of 16 years as our auditors, the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board felt it was a good governance practice to initiate a competitive process earlier this year. I am pleased to share that after a full and rigorous evaluation, Deloitte & Touche will be Air Products' external auditor beginning with our fiscal year 2019. KPMG will continue as our auditor through the completion of our fiscal 2018 audit. I would like to emphasize that this decision was not the result of any disagreement with KPMG and that there are no issues with Air Products' financial statements or controls. I would like to thank the KPMG team members we have worked with over the years, and I look forward to working with the Deloitte team. Now, please turn to slide 11 for our Q3 results from continuing operations. Sales of $2.3 billion increased 6% versus last year on 3% higher volumes, 1% higher price, and 3% higher currency. We saw solid volume increases across all three regions, partially offset by lower activity from the Jazan project in Global Gases. Excluding Jazan, volumes were up 7% with about 5% from new plants. Sequential volumes were up on strength in Americas and seasonality in Asia. Versus last year, pricing was up 1%, primarily driven by the China and Europe merchant businesses. Positive currency was driven by the euro, British pound and the Chinese RMB. EBITDA of $820 million improved by 13%, driven by the higher volumes, positive pricing, currency and equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin of 36.3% was up 220 basis points. Net income was up 19% and adjusted earnings per share were up 18% versus prior year. ROCE of 12.2% was flat versus last year as our significant profit increase offset the larger denominator which increased as a result of the gain from the PMD sale in early 2017. The denominator is based on the five-quarter average. Q3 FY 2018 has five quarters that include the PMD gain, while Q3 of FY 2017 only had two quarters with the PMD gain. You can see the real improvement more clearly in the sequential 40-basis-point increase. Please turn to slide 12. Our record adjusted Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.95 increased $0.30 or 18% versus last year. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.18 per share. Price and raw materials taken together increased EPS by $0.04. Net cost performance was unfavorable at 0.08 as productivity was again offset by a few factors including planned maintenance costs, inflation, and the end of the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. We also continued to see higher costs in strategic areas focused on pursuing our exciting growth opportunities. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.05 favorable primarily due to the euro, British pound, and the Chinese RMB. Equity affiliate income added $0.05 primarily due to underlying strength in Mexico and Italy. The overall tax rate was a $0.12 benefit versus last year. The lower tax rate from the new Tax Act increased EPS by about $0.10, which is more than previous quarters due to higher profit contributions from our U.S. business. For the full-year 2018, we now expect to see a tax rate slightly above 19%. Non-controlling interest was a $0.04 headwind. This is primarily due to a gain shared with our partner, which resulted from a customer terminating a contract for an old flue-gas desulphurization plant, which is a consolidated JV for Air Products. Interest expense, shares outstanding, and other non-operating income totaled $0.02 unfavorable. Now please turn to slide 13. We had another strong cash flow quarter, with over $500 million of distributable cash flow and almost $300 million of investable cash flow. On a last 12 months basis, you can see we generated over $3 billion of EBITDA and over $2 billion of distributable cash flow. From the $2.2 billion of distributable cash flow, we paid $864 million or almost 40% as dividends. This leaves over $1.3 billion available for high return investments in our core industrial gas business. Turning to slide 14, I would like to update you on the capital deployment capacity available for these exciting opportunities that Seifi mentioned. As of June 30, we have about $3 billion of cash in short-term investments. Our debt balance as of June 30 is about $3.9 billion. As we have shared many times, we have an active dialogue with the rating agencies and are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. If we move (19:10) our debt level to about 2.5 times EBITDA, this would allow us to borrow an additional $4 billion. So, in total, we have about $7 billion we can deploy today, while maintaining our A/A2 rating at a debt level of 2.5 times. This capacity increases to about $8.5 billion at a debt level of three times EBITDA. In addition, we have been and expect to continue to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx and dividends. So, over the next five years, we expect to have $15 billion available to invest, which does not include extra capacity from the cash flows from new profitable projects. Now, to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Now, please turn to slide number 15, our Gases Americas, where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth. Sales increased 16% versus last year, driven by higher volumes, positive pricing and favorable currency impact. Volumes were up 6% excluding the impact of the one-time equipment sale last year – volumes were actually up 16% if you exclude the equipment sale, as I said. New projects were responsible for about three-quarters of this 16% increase, while gases business and acquisitions, they're roughly equal to the rest of the business. I believe at the beginning, I said Gases Americas. I meant Gases Asia, so there's no confusion. I'm talking about our business in Asia. I wish our Americas business revolved around (21:14) 16%. That is not the case. Okay. Pricing for the region was up 4% versus last year, the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year improvement, which was primarily driven by better supply-and-demand situation in China's merchant market. Strong volumes, higher pricing and favorable currency more than offset the prior-year equipment sale headwind and drove the nearly 30% increase in EBITDA. EBITDA margin was strong and up 400 basis points. Sequentially, both volume and price increased as China emerged from the Lunar New Year holiday. As mentioned in our last call, we closed the Lu'An project during quarter three. The team is making great progress as we bring the four gasifier trains on stream in stages. As we shared in April, we still expect about $0.04 earnings per share contribution in fiscal year 2018 and we expect the plant to be at full-run capacity by the end of September and therefore expect at least $0.25 per share of accretion in 2019 from the Lu'An project. Now, I would like to turn this call back to Scott to discuss our Americas result, please.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Seifi. Please turn to slide 16 for a review of our Gases Americas results. For the quarter, sales grew 2% with 6% higher volumes, partially offset by lower energy cost pass-through. Hydrogen demand remained strong and our new plant in Baytown, Texas supported increased sales. Underlying merchant volumes were positive, partially offset by a wholesale contract we terminated in Q4 of FY 2017. Excluding this, our overall volumes would have been up 8%. The overall pricing impact was flat as higher North American prices were offset by negative mix. This negative mix, for example, includes higher U.S. government helium sales that are lower than average prices. EBITDA was up 4% compared to prior year, driven by higher volumes partially offset by higher costs. As we communicated last quarter, we had higher planned maintenance costs as we performed life extension work on several older hydrogen plants to support contract renewals. Our team executed a significant amount of work safely and effectively. And as I mentioned earlier, we no longer have the cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 capture project. However, as expected, partially offsetting these higher maintenance costs was a gain associated with a customer terminating a contract for an old flue-gas desulfurization plant. We also saw improved equity affiliate income with strong results in Mexico. EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points due to the positive margin impact of the lower energy cost pass-through. As we move into Q4, we expect maintenance costs to be lower sequentially but higher than prior year since maintenance activities were significantly lower than average in Q4 last year. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss other segments. Simon?
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to slide 17 for a review of our Gases EMEA results. Sales increased 24% primarily driven by a strong 12% volume increase. Price improved 3%, while energy pass-through and currency were up 2% and 7% respectively. Demand for hydrogen in the EMEA region was also strong. Our new hydrogen plant in India, onstream during a portion of Q3 last year, drove about 10% of our volume growth, and our Rotterdam franchise also contributed. As a reminder, the India plant was fully onstream in Q4 last year, so we don't expect a year-over-year benefit in Q4 of FY 2018. Base merchant volume improved 2% supported by liquid bulk and packaged gases growth and a few small acquisitions. The robust activity in the merchant market also translated into higher pricing. The 3% uplift in price was predominantly due to a pricing action success in packaged gases. This represents our best pricing performance in many years. EBITDA was up 19% compared to prior year, primarily from the new plant in India and further supported by higher merchant volume, positive price, and favorable currency. EBITDA margin of 33% was down 160 basis points. However, excluding the new plant in India, which has comparatively high natural gas costs and other energy pass-through, EBITDA margin was actually up over 100 basis points. Now, please turn to slide 18 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and profits were down as we get closer to the end of the Jazan sale of equipment project. We continue to expect this to result in lower revenue in FY 2018, while we now also expect profits to be down slightly for the year. We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and, as we have said, expect onstream in phases early in fiscal 2019. Now, please turn to slide 19 for a brief comment on our Corporate segment, which includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Although LNG project activity remains weak, sales increased slightly compared to prior year, but overall segment profits were flat. We continue to see signs of renewed interest in future LNG projects, but do not expect this to translate to an earnings tailwind in the near future. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon. Our team around the world is very excited about Air Products' future. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide the foundation of our continued growth. And the evolution of our Five-Point Plan provides the framework to drive our success going forward. As I said before, we have the financial capacity, the opportunities and the team to successfully win key growth projects. Let me just address the current state of global trade relations and tariffs. Very simply, we have not – I'd like to stress – we have not seen any impact on Air Products at this point. Our business is local, so we don't have any direct exposure to import-export tariffs. We have not seen consumers changing their behavior. And as I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to close the Lu'An joint venture in China earlier this quarter as we expected. There is no doubt that there is uncertainty in the world. And while we cannot predict or control worldwide political or economic developments, we do have control over the operational performance and growth of Air Products, and we are confident we will continue to deliver on the commitments that we have made. Now, please turn to slide number 20. We are working hard every day to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. That continues to be our goal. Continuing our positive momentum, we have again increased our guidance for the year to a range of $7.40 to $7.45. At midpoint, this is up $0.10 from the guidance we gave you last quarter. Our new guidance represents 17% to 18% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance. As I said, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment to grow our EPS by at least 10% each year for the future. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, our earnings per share guidance is $1.95 to $2, up 11% to 14% over last year. We continue to expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion in fiscal year 2018. Now, please turn to slide 21. I've talked about this many times. I don't need to repeat that. And please turn now to slide number 23 (sic) [22] (31:25). You can see that we believe very strongly that our real competitive advantage is the degree of commitment and motivation of the great team that we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to continue to generate superior safety and operational performance. I do want to thank all of our 15,000 employees around the world for their total commitment and hard work, and I'm very proud to be part of this winning team. Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I was curious of the strength in affiliates. You mentioned that was a big part of the U.S. or the Americas business and I know its overall up nearly 40%. Can you give us some color on what's going on there? And then, maybe also, Seifi, when you were giving your capital allocation potential buckets, acquisition of gas assets, is the affiliates considered in that bucket? Thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Bob, good morning. Thanks for your question. I'll answer your question number two first and make a comment on question number one and then turn it over to Scott to elaborate. On question number two, when we talk about the $15 billion of investment capacity, that does not include any acquisition or anything by our affiliates. That's just Air Products. Then, with respect to your question number one, we have always said that we see a strong economic activity in India, and that has obviously contributed to affiliates. And we had some obvious growth in Italy and Mexico, which are our big equity affiliates. But, Scott, would you like to expand on that, please?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. I'd just emphasize what you already said. It's broad-based, Bob. It's good fundamental business performance in Mexico, in Italy, in India, and actually some of our smaller ones in Asia as well. So, real good performance across the board this quarter from our equity affiliates.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Bob.
Operator: Next is Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Your volumes in the Americas were up 6%, and your volumes in Americas have been pretty good through the first three quarters of the year. That is all of the numbers have been comparable. But your operating income has been pretty flat. I was wondering what's behind that in that your results versus your competitors seem to be – to show much slower growth in EBIT. And maybe to rephrase Bob's question, your equity affiliates income was $24 million in the Americas versus $14 million in the year ago. Is the $24 million number a new run rate or is there something unusual about that $24 million level?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. Well, there is nothing unusual about the run rate, first of all, Jeff, so we expect our equity affiliates to do well. With respect to the Americas, we have an issue in terms of mix. That means that our volumes are up because we were selling more to customers who have a lower price basically. That is the fundamental reason why you don't (35:32) we are not particularly excited about that, but that is the explanation. Overall, Jeff, you know the business very well. Fundamentally, our prices is going to be the same as other people's prices. We are not going to fall behind on that, because if our prices are lower, we will get significantly higher volumes. But I'd just like to turn it over to Scott to expand on what I said.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks, Seifi. I just want to build – I think I made some comments in the prepared remarks. In Americas, just recall we have a very nice leadership position in hydrogen and we saw some maintenance planned turns. The team did a great job of executing those. But that's driving costs up year-on-year. So that's also a reason why you don't see the operating income growth consistent with the top line. Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay, Jeff?
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next is Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yes. Seifi, question on your capital allocation buckets. I notice that share repurchase continues to not be on that list. I'm just wondering, especially post Air Products not participating in any of the Praxair, Linde sales in Europe or the Americas, whether you've re-thought your approach to share repurchase.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No, we have not. Because I mean, share repurchase obviously – what does it do for you? It artificially improves your EPS. We are taking the position that of the cash that we generate, we are giving half of that in dividend to the investors. So, it's not as if we are holding all the cash. So, half of that is going to a very generous dividend policy that we are saying we give 2.5% of stock price as dividend. The other half, we believe very strongly that we have opportunities to invest that capital on projects that we will create significantly more value for the shareholders than buying the shares back, so that is our position. That hasn't changed. And we do not see any change in the outlook for the deployment of the capital, so therefore that's where we are.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And then a follow-up, you noted that you had record EBITDA margins in the quarter. Are you now at an inflection point given the strong base business volume growth that the incremental loadings are generating very strong incremental margin? So, should we look for a continuation of this strong EBITDA margin performance?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, obviously, we are very pleased with the EBITDA margin for the quarter. But for the long term, we have always told the investors to, please, when you make models for Air Products that our EBITDA range is going to be somewhere between 33% to 36%. It's not going to go down and it will be within that range. Now, some quarters like this quarter, we had 36.3%. I hope it repeats every quarter, but I don't want to give the impression that our margins are now suddenly going to be several basis points higher than what our run rate has been for the last two quarters. And obviously, now our EBITDA margins are almost 300% better than the next people. Okay?
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Morning, David.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Seifi, on Americas pricing you said, so again, positive in the quarter, any acceleration versus prior quarters? You've announced a lot of price increases. And is that positive North American pricing up around 2% or more or less?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: It's about 2%. But the thing is that usually, we don't like to make too many comments about pricing. But we obviously fully understand that higher prices means higher profit. That's what our organization is focused on that. But we need to have a balance between what we can charge and what the supply-demand situation is. But our utilization rate in the U.S., please consider that it is still in the – around 77%, 78%. Now, in places that our utilization rate is above 80% like in China, we are getting significant price increases as you see.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And Seifi, on the $15 billion of capital deployment, thank you for the breakdown. If you did it by geography or by country, how would that break down roughly speaking in your best estimate?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I mean, it's very difficult to kind of pinpoint that. But order of magnitude, obviously we would like to invest as much as we can in the U.S. But right now from what we see order of magnitude, probably about $2.5 billion will be in the Americas, about maybe $2.5 billion to $3 billion in Europe including Russia and then, the balance of it in Asia-Pacific because anything that we invest in India is really equity affiliate. It's not part of the numbers that I've given you.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we'll now go to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, fellas.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: First question is just on the India plant and its impact on the margins in EMEA. It sounded like you were negative 160 basis points year-over-year, but you said you would be up 100 bps without that. 260 bps of delta seems like a lot of influence from one plant. Can you just walk through the economics and why that's such a big hit to that region?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, since Simon was talking about Europe, I'll have him answer that. Go ahead, Simon.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. Duffy, so two things to remember. First of all, this is a great project, very, very good returns on this project. But the natural gas prices are extremely high in India. I think they're in the range of $12 per million BTUs. So, you have a very large hydrogen plant, very high natural gas prices, so that has a pretty significant dilutive effect on the margins. And I think you've seen that over the last few quarters. We also, by the way, had some additional energy pass-through in Europe. And just one final point is, in Q4, we'll lap this, so you won't see a year-over-year delta next quarter.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then, just to go back to the buckets on the capital allocation, in the $7 billion that you called out as being large energy projects, how much of that would actually be coal gasification in China versus all other?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Duffy, I give more details and, obviously, the investors want even more details. We thought we have gone a long way by actually breaking down that, but out of the $7 billion, I expect approximately $5 billion will be in China.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to PJ Juvekar with Citi.
PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning. How are you, PJ?
PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good. So, what are margin utilization rates in Europe and Asia where you are seeing positive pricing? And how does that compare to Americas where pricing is still flat? I know you mentioned in the response to earlier question that in America you're selling with lower price – not lower price but lower-price customers. But can you just compare the utilization rates?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. Our utilization rate in the Americas is around 77% to 78%. Utilization in Europe is around 80%. In China, the industry utilization is around 55% to 60%. But Air Products' utilization rate, because we haven't built a lot of merchant plants, our utilization rate in China right now is at around 82% to 84%. So, that is where we are, and you can obviously correlate pricing to the utilization rate. I mean, it's obvious if you're selling a commodity LOX/LIN, and that is totally subject to supply-demand.
PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you for that. And you acquired Shell's coal gasification technology. Has that improved your competitiveness in bidding for coal gasification projects, and are there any projects outside of China that you are looking at?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: PJ, I cannot – now that the deal is closed, this has been a fantastic deal for us and it has created significant opportunities and we are seeing a lot of things that we didn't see before. So, I'm very happy with that acquisition. In addition to that, that has opened up significant opportunities outside of China. Yes, we are very pleased with the acquisition. It was the right thing to do. We have gotten a lot of very capable and very talented people. And that has given us – I think at the end, it will give us a significant competitive edge.
PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Any particular regions outside of China?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Outside of China, it will be – it is places like Indonesia, Australia, Middle East, Europe, it's all over the place, and the United States. But please when I'm talking about Shell, I need to clarify. We bought two technologies from Shell. One is for coal gasification and the other one is for liquid gasification. The liquid gasification is also important because, PJ, as you know very well, a lot of the refineries need to upgrade their bottom of the barrel because of the IMO 2020. One of the ways to solve the problem of dealing with high-sulfur residue is rather than coking it, is to use that liquid and gasify it. That is what Saudi Arabia is doing with the Jazan Project, so that I think will open up opportunities for us because we own the Shell technology for liquid gasification.
PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you for that explanation. Thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: We'll go to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you. So, clearly, hydrogen appears to be the key driver of the positive momentum in volumes. Can you just hit on some other key end markets as well? Is anything surprising to the upside or downside versus your initial excitations at the beginning of the year? And then just also any long-term comments on your outlook for, you hit on this a little, on energy and then also environment? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, thank you very much, Chris. In terms of the day-to-day things, obviously we are seeing economic development in the U.S., which is helping with the utilization rates a little bit, although it's not as robust as we hoped. But in China, the growth has not slowed down and we are growing very well there. In India, we don't consolidate, but the growth rates are very good. And quite frankly, as I think I've mentioned to you before in one-on-one, Europe has been a surprise on the positive side because quite frankly we thought that with the Brexit and all of that, that European economy will suffer. It has not. So as a result, it's not growing very fast, but it is tightening, and you can see that the pricing is improving there. So, those are overall the positive things. Then with respect to the very big projects, yes, we are very optimistic about that. There is significant activity with respect to big projects in China, and in Middle East, in Russia, in the U.S. So, we see a lot of so-called mega projects.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And you've also been successful in establishing a portfolio which lends itself to the onsite utility type model. Can you just remind us of your longer-term goals in terms of projected earnings stability, just with any details or consideration for both the composition of your backlog and projected capital deployment? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure, Chris. Obviously, if you go on my wish-list, I hope that five years from now 75% of our business is onsite. And I think that will probably happen with the way that we are deploying the capital. Our base business, merchant business and packaged gases business will continue to grow. We are not going more onsite at the expense of that business, but that business which is our liquid business and our packaged gases business, is going to grow with global GDP, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5% a year. But our ambitions are significantly higher than that. We want to grow the company by more than 10% as we have done in the past four years. That means that by default, although our base business is continuing to grow, our onsite businesses will grow faster. Therefore, when you put it all together, hopefully by 2023 75% of Air Products business will be onsite, which will be very stable and very profitable in terms of not only margins, but also in terms of return on capital employed.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for your thoughts as always. Appreciate it.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Seifi, perhaps Simon pulled a fast one on you and changed the order of the slides and moved the Asia segment to be discussed first instead of last, but I suspect from your commentary about capital allocation by region that was intentional. Would you say in this five-year plan that could become your largest segment?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, first of all, I'd like to make a comment. I've just landed from a 14-hour overnight flight. And I just came to the office. So, I think you need to give me a little bit of a break for not mixing up Gases Americas and Gases Asia. But Simon had the slides in the right order but I just – when I was looking at it, I just said Gases Americas rather than Gases Asia. But right now when you look at our Americas business, I think we disclosed that. That's about a $4 billion business. Our Asia business is right now running at around $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion. With the capital deployment programs that we have, our Americas section will grow. But I think in five years, I don't expect Asia to be double in size, but it might, it might become our biggest region by 2023, 2024. And right now, we are – I mean if it grows with the kind of EBITDA margin that we have, which is 43%, that would be very good.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And trust me, Seifi, that was just all in fun. But with respect to Asia and your outlook for coal gasification, obviously it's a strong market opportunity in terms of demand and you have technology. But would you also say that you – in the competitive bidding process, it's maybe a little less intense, particularly on bids that include the gasifier in addition to the air separation units?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: That is not the case. We just lost the big coal gasification project to one of our competitors. I obviously don't want to mention who it is. But if people are telling you they are not pursuing coal gasification in China, you should ask them again. Everybody is there. Everybody is eager to win a project. And as I said, last month, we lost a coal gasification project in China, in southern China, to one of our competitors who claims they are not that excited about China. So, everybody is there, my friend. When people look at these projects and the size and the profitability, they are not going to give us a break, they are following us where we are going.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next is John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. First, the question about pricing in Europe and then maybe a follow-up on the environmental CapEx allocation that you've got. In Europe, that record 3% price increase, I can't imagine that CO2 kind of contributed to that and I would think Praxair and Linde are not being that aggressive on price given they're in front of regulators. So, what's allowing you right now to achieve that kind of price versus in past periods?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I would say good execution but, again, since Simon made comments about Europe, Simon, would you like to answer that?
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So, John, obviously we can't speak to what the competition is doing. The team is working hard on pricing in the Europe region and we did emphasize that we saw a lot of the strength in packaged gas here this past quarter. So, quite frankly, good job by the team.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And from CO2 it was very little. Not significant.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: On the $7 billion that you're going to put into energy environmental, obviously, environmental in the past with Tees Valley and some of the earlier projects, you're probably not headed down that path again, but what are you thinking about there when you say environmental?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: What we are talking about is projects that would help with solving environmental issues. The biggest thing that we are referring to is, number one, this IMO20 where people have to do something with the bottom of the barrel and the second thing that we are talking about is coal gasification which is a much more environmentally friendly of using the coal rather than burning it in a power plant to generate power.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. So, you're including coal gasification when you say environmental.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next is John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the backlog, it seems like it's been kind of static here for, I guess, the last quarter or two. And I know you have a number of opportunities that you highlighted. I guess, at least in terms of where you think the capital is going to get deployed, I guess how are you thinking about the timing of when we may start hearing about some of these and getting the contracts to kind of the finish line? And I think you mentioned it in the beginning that you didn't see the tariff issues necessarily having any impact. And so, I guess, what's holding up some of the announcement on this or is it just simply a timing issue?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, John, you are putting me in a position that – especially my lawyer is sitting here and saying, don't make too many forward-looking statements here. But we are working, obviously, on a lot of projects. But quite frankly, John, this is a formal call. This is not a casual conversation. I'm the chairman of the company, and I'm saying that we feel very confident about deploying the capital. So, I can only say that if I see a backlog of projects that we are working on. Now, when are they going to come to fruition and when are we going to be able to announce them? I mean, I obviously can't predict that, but we definitely have a robust number of projects that we are definitely working on. No question.
John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Fair enough. Thanks very much for the color.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, John.
Operator: And we'll go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning, everyone. And Seifi, I hope you get some good sleep tonight. You're probably pretty tired.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just looking at slide 24, the project slide, and I know you guys are out of the – telling us what the EPS contribution is from new projects. But you've got a bunch of stuff that's scheduled to come online in fiscal 2019. So, as we think about our models, if you can give us any update or any color sort of on first half, second half, second quarter, fourth quarter, just sort of any sense or dimension around the start-ups there.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, on that one, Andrew (sic) [Vincent] (57:33), one thing that we have said and we stand behind that is that we want to grow EPS at least 10%. So, you should expect that our guidance for 2019 will be 10% higher than 2018, I mean, unless the world falls apart. But other than that, in terms of the specifics, I think we are very specific in terms of the timing of these things. But to break it down by quarter, well, these are plants, new plants start up. The customer has to be ready and all of that. So, I would be a little bit hesitant to start pinpointing it by quarter. But overall, as I said, on overall basis, obviously we need the contribution of these projects in order to deliver the 10%.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And, Simon, you'd like to...
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Just obviously, Vincent, Seifi again reminded us that we have made a specific comment around the Lu'An project and we'd expect that to deliver at least $0.25 next year. So, yeah.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, there was something written during the quarter about a CO2 shortage in Europe. Doesn't seem like it was an issue within your results, but any comments there vis-à-vis your results?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the reason is that we are not very big in CO2 in Europe. So, the whole event didn't have too much of an impact on us at all.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And next is Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning. This is Matt on for Kevin.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes. Hi, Matt.
Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. If we were to rewind to this time last year, the company was discussing the possibility of participating in remedy asset divestitures from Praxair-Linde, about like $1 billion in revenue. Since then, Messer and Nippon Sanso seemed to have secured the divested assets. But can you kind of walk through what were the primary reasons for why you ended up taking a pass on the businesses given just the capital deployment targets the company has?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We didn't take a pass. The regulators decided to give us a pass. We would have – we've always said we were interested in that. But the regulators decided that we should go do other things.
Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC: No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then I might have missed this, I was jumping around a little bit. But Gases – Global kind of showed a nice sequential uptick in EBIT despite the ongoing headwinds from the lower Jazan sales. What was behind the improvement there?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Simon?
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. And again, I would just point out that the technical term for Jazan is lumpy, so it just moves around a little bit especially sequentially.
Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC: All right. Thanks, Simon.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. Could you remind us about what you're expecting from currency that's incorporated into the fourth quarter guidance?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. Hi, Jim. How are you?
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: So, year-to-date, we're at about $0.20 earnings per share versus prior year through three quarters. And our view, as always, is we just assume things kind of move sideways from where they are as we're closing the quarter. And so, if we look at that, we think it's going to be flat, maybe a modest headwind in our fourth quarter versus the prior year given where the currencies are now.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. And could you comment on which end markets you're seeing the most strength in besides refining?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Around the – we don't usually comment by markets, but overall, in the U.S. it's really most of the sectors, whether it is food, whether it is steel, whether it is – all of the other things. In China, it is obviously consumer demand for the products that we have around the world. So, it's a mix, it's not any very particular market that suddenly has started contributing to our bottom line. As you know, we have more than 60,000 customers around the world. So, we do not see any suddenly one sector growing 10%. It's just across the board and that's the good thing about our company because we have exposure to all of these businesses.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we will go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: A very quick one and given the end of the call is, can you characterize how your cash tax rate will evolve as your mix shifts around the world or as the types of project shift? But that seems to be affecting the conversion of EBITDA growth into distributable cash flow.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, that's a very good question. And since it's a difficult question, I'll give it to you, Scott, to answer.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Back to your comment around forward-looking statements, right, Seifi? So, if I just (01:02:46) again for this year in terms of a book for the fourth quarter, we're thinking about 20%, so we'll come in for the year in total a little bit above 19%. And then as we go forward from a cash tax perspective, obviously, we're focused on making more money in all parts of the world. About $400 million or so cash taxes for this year and early indications, you can assume roughly about the same for next year. Again, it depends on the amount, so that depends on the locations. I think in terms of a percent of cash taxes as a percent of pre-tax earnings, kind of the high-teens is what we would say going forward, a reasonable assumption at this point, okay?
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice quarter.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Mike.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Seifi, volumes have been pretty good this year and just wanted your general thoughts. Do you think this industrial economy is kind of at a pretty good level? Is it getting better when you think about heading into 2019?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, right now, the way we see it, China is going to continue to be strong, we don't see any sign of a slowdown there. I hope Europe stays where it is, which means that although it's not growing very fast, it's not going down. And the U.S., obviously, it depends on the effect of the tax cut and all of that. But, right now, it looks okay. So, we continue to...
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And then one...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Go ahead.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Well, just as a quick one on 2019, how much volume will come from projects coming on stream? I don't know if – I apologize if I missed that earlier.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I can't give you an exact number on that because then you'll pretty quickly figure out what you should do next year. But overall, we usually don't give that number out, so if you excuse us for that. We don't like to break that down because then people can figure out exactly what the return on the projects are and all that. That will be...
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, thank you. With that, I think there are no more questions. And I just like to thank everybody again for being on the call. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentations. We very much appreciate your interest. And we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a great day and all the best. Thank you.
Operator: And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products & Chemicals Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Vicky. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' second quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure that can be found in our earnings release and on slide number 2. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. The talented, motivated and committed team at Air Products delivered yet another excellent set of safety and financial results in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 were up 20% versus last year. This is the 16th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth, and the fourth consecutive quarter we have delivered EPS growth of more than 15%. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, with EBITDA margins over 34% for the quarter. And most importantly, we have a great team of focused and committed people at Air Products, who work hard every day to serve our customers and create value for our shareholders. Now please turn to slide number 3, we continue to improve our safety results with a reduction of 71% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 57% in our recordable injury rate. These results can only happen when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are totally focused on safety and continuous improvement. This same commitment to operational excellence is what is driving our strong financial performance. Now, please turn to slide number 4, which is our goal for the company. To be the most the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Now, please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times in the last four years. We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation and an empowered and decentralized organization. On the slide number 6, you can see our five-point plan which has been the roadmap to our success over the last four years. Now, please turn to slide number 7. We have delivered on the promises we made over the – more than the promises that we made to you over three years ago. We have become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have delivered that we have divested our non-core assets and created the best balance sheet in the industry. And we have delivered greater than 10% per year earning per share growth in each of the last two years, with our guidance for this year implying yet another year of over 10% growth. In summary, we have delivered what we have promised, and as a result, we now have the balance sheet and are well-positioned to grow Air Products as we move forward. We continue to see great opportunities in the three areas that I have talked to you about previously. To mention them again, first, acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets or businesses from other industrial gas companies. Second, the opportunity to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee under a long-term contract. This is what we call asset buybacks and we see opportunities for oxygen, hydrogen and syngas plants around the world in this category. And the third area of opportunity is very large industrial gas projects around the world driven by demand for more energy, environmental requirements and emerging market growth. Now, please turn to slide number 8, where I would like to provide an update on one of our exciting projects that is a great example of the growth opportunities I just talked about. We announced the $1.3 billion Lu'An syngas joint venture in September of last year. As a reminder, the joint venture will be 60% owned and majority controlled by Air Products. Lu'An provides coal, steam and power to the joint venture, and the joint venture will supply syngas to Lu'An. The joint venture will be paid a fixed fee by Lu'An under a long-term contract. Our team has been working closely with Lu'An and the many government agencies in China to get final approval so that they can formally close the transaction. We had indicated before that we expected this to be done by this summer. I am very pleased to announce today that due to the outstanding efforts of Air Products team and the efficient and cooperative support of government entities in China, we formally closed this transaction just a few hours ago. I'd like to repeat that since this is not in our press release because it happened just a few hours ago. We now are formally closed on the transaction with Lu'An and we own the facilities. Now that the transaction is closed, we will begin receiving our monthly fee from Lu'An based on the gradual start-up of the facility. That is why we have included a modest contribution of about $0.04 in our updated 2018 full year EPS guidance as well as including approximately $400 million to $500 million in our CapEx guidance. I would like to confirm that we expect this transaction to contribute about $0.25 to our earning per share for full 2019. This project is a perfect fit with our strategy and a great example of the investment opportunities in our core Industrial Gases business. It is an asset buyback of an expanded scope project under the onsite business model. Now, please go to a slide number 9, which shows you the results of our three key metrics for the quarter and the year. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics. Finally, please turn to slide number 10, which obviously continues to be my favorite slide. It's great to see sustainable margins in the mid-30s range. The chart also reminds us how far we have come in only a few years. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Seifi. Please turn to slide 11 for our Q2 results. Sales of $2.2 billion increased 9% versus last year on 4% higher volumes and 5% higher currency. We saw volume increases across all three regions, partially offset by lower activity from the Jazan project in Global Gases. Excluding Jazan, volumes were up 10% with about half from new plants. Pricing was up 1% primarily driven by the China merchant business. Positive currency was driven by the euro, British pound, and the Chinese RMB. EBITDA of $739 million improved by 13%, driven by the higher volumes, positive pricing and currency. EBITDA margin of 34.3% was up 140 basis points, primarily on the higher volumes. Sequential volumes were down and margins were up due to the plant sale in China last quarter. Net income and adjusted earnings per share both increased by 20% versus prior year. ROCE of 11.8% declined 50 basis points versus last year despite the profit increase. This is because the denominator of the ROCE calculation increased as a result of the gain from the PMD sale. The denominator is based on a five-quarter average. Q2 FY 2018 includes five quarters that include the PMD gain, while Q2 FY 2017 only had one quarter with the PMD gain. Please turn to slide 12. We had one non-GAAP item this quarter, as we recognized an income tax benefit of $39 million due to the restructuring of select foreign subsidiaries. Our adjusted Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.71 increased $0.28 or 20% versus last year. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.12 per share. Price and raw materials taken together increased EPS by $0.02. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.06 as productivity was offset by a few factors including inflation, higher incentive compensation, a legal settlement and the end of a cost reimbursement for our Port Arthur CO2 project. In addition, as you would expect, we are incurring higher costs associated with the exciting growth opportunities we are pursuing. Finally, as I mentioned previously, this cost major factor includes the Transition Service Agreements or TSAs we had been providing to both Evonik and Versum. The Evonik TSA ended in Q1 and the Versum TSA ended in Q2. We did take actions to reduce the costs associated with providing these services. But as expected, we saw a small timing gap in Q2. Going forward, we don't expect to see any impact from the TSAs. Currency and foreign exchange was $0.09 favorable primarily due to the euro, British pound and the Chinese RMB. Equity affiliate income added $0.03 due to currency and underlying strength across several of our JVs, particularly Mexico. The overall tax rate was a $0.09 benefit versus last year. As expected, the lower tax rate due to the new Tax Act increased EPS by about $0.06 per share. The other $0.03 was due to geographical earnings mix and a larger impact from accounting for share-based compensation. For the full year 2018, we expect to see a tax rate of approximately 20%, including the benefit of the new Tax Act. Non-controlling interest, interest expense, shares outstanding and other non-operating income totaled $0.01 unfavorable. Now, please turn to slide 13. We had another strong cash flow quarter in Q2 with over $500 million of distributable cash flow and investible cash flow was up almost $150 million to a total of $300 million. Investible cash flow is the amount of cash we have discretion or choice to deploy to create shareholder value. In other words, cash available after we pay interest, taxes, maintenance CapEx, and dividends. There were two quarters investible cash flow is almost $650 million. Turning to slide 14, I would like to update you on the capital deployment capacity that we have available for major projects and acquisitions. We have about $3 billion of cash and short-term investments available to invest as of March 31. Our debt balance as of March 31 is about $3.5 billion. As you know, we have an active dialogue with the rating agencies and are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. At this point, we believe this should enable a debt level of at least 2.5 times EBITDA or about $7.5 billion. This provides about $4 billion of debt capacity to invest. So, in total, we have about $7 billion we can deploy today, while maintaining our A/A2 rating. In addition, we expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investible cash. Again, that's after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx and dividends. So, over the next five years, we expect to have at least $13 billion available to invest which does not include leverage above 2.5 times or extra capacity from investing in profitable projects. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. All three industrial gas regional segments delivered strong volume results with the combination of new plants coming on stream and higher base business sales. EBITDA was up in all three regions, with particular strength in EMEA and Asia. I would like to thank our team who remains focused on driving improvement in our existing business, while we pursue exciting new opportunities like Lu'An. Now, please turn to slide 15 for a review of our Gases Americas results. For the quarter, sales were up 3%, primarily driven by higher volumes. Hydrogen demand was again strong despite the lower Gulf Coast demand during early in the quarter due to severe winter weather there. The Merchant business achieved positive growth, overcoming the terminated wholesale contract I mentioned last quarter. Overall, Latin American Merchant volumes were slightly higher versus prior year on the strength particularly in Brazil. Overall pricing impact was again slightly positive but rounded to flat as our pricing actions were partially offset by negative mix. We continue to work hard on pricing and just announced an argon price increase. The extreme weather I mentioned impacted both our and our customers' operations. Our team worked tirelessly in challenging conditions to minimize the impact to our customers. I would like to extend my gratitude to the whole team for their excellent work and dedication. EBITDA was up 3% compared to prior year, as contributions from higher volumes and underlying productivity more than offset the adverse weather impact and several of the cost items that Scott mentioned. Sequentially, volume was down due to the winter weather impacts, while EBITDA improved due to reduced maintenance costs. In Q3, we expect maintenance costs to increase as several major plant turnarounds are scheduled for our hydrogen business. These plants operate at high temperatures and typically have major turnarounds every four years or so. So, the maintenance costs will vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Some of these plants have been in operation for over 20 years and the good news is that we've been able to extend the original contracts. As you would expect, more work is done during an outage for these older plants, and this is part of our commitment to reliably serve our customers. Partially offsetting the higher maintenance, we expect a positive impact associated with a customer terminating a contract for an old flue-gas desulfurization plant. Now, please turn to slide 16 to review our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. Sales were up 36% with volumes up 20%, pricing up 1% and currency up 15%. Our new hydrogen plant in India, in its third full quarter of operation contributed about three-quarters of the volume growth. Other onsite volumes were up driven by strong hydrogen demand in our Rotterdam franchise. And despite Easter, shifting into Q2 this year, Merchant volumes were up supported by both liquid bulk and packaged gases with a modest contribution from a few small acquisitions. Overall, pricing was up 1% as a result of our pricing program success. EBITDA was up 29% compared to prior year, underpinned by the new plant in India, Merchant sales and pricing actions and favorable currency. EBITDA margin of 32% was down 160 basis points, but excluding the new plant in India, which is comparatively high natural gas costs, EBITDA margin was up slightly from prior year. Please turn to slide 17, Gases Asia, where we continue to deliver strong sales and profit growth. Sales increased 28% compared to prior year, driven by 17% higher volumes, 3% positive pricing and 8% favorable currency impact. New onsites contributed just over half of the 17% volume growth. Base business contributed about a third, while net acquisitions and divestitures added another 2%. Pricing for the region was up 3% versus prior year and down 1% sequentially. The supply and demand balance and our shift to retail sales in China remained positives for us. As we predicted in our last call, sequential pricing dipped slightly due to demand easing with the Lunar New Year holidays and the spot opportunity last quarter. Between our approach to the market and the improved market conditions, we believe we are positioned to continue the positive pricing trend which began in Q3 of FY 2017. Strong volume, higher pricing and favorable currency drove the 30% EBITDA increase. EBITDA margin was up 70 basis points, primarily due to higher pricing. Sequential comparisons were impacted by the contract termination and plant sale in the prior quarter and the Lunar New Year. Excluding the plant sale, profit was nearly flat compared to Q1 despite the Lunar New Year slowdown. Seifi provided an exciting update on the Lu'An project. The team welcomes this new opportunity while we continue to execute on the base business – productivity and safety. In February, we announced a significant win to supply Samsung Electronics' second semiconductor fab in Xi'an, China. Air Products has been successfully supplying Samsung's first Xi'an fab since 2014. This is our third major announcement related to Samsung since the beginning of the year; the others being Pyeongtaek and Tanjung, Korea. Finally, please turn to slide 18 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as central Industrial Gas business costs. Sales and profits were down as we get closer to the end of the Jazan sale of equipment project. We expect this to result in lower revenue in FY 2018 while profits should be about flat. We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project, and as we have said, expect the onstreams in phases early in fiscal 2019. Now, I'll turn the call back to Simon for a comment on our Corporate segment.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 19. Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our Corporate costs. Sales were flat as LNG project activity remains weak however there are some signs of renewed interest in future LNG projects. Corporate costs were up slightly in part due to the higher growth-related cost that Scott mentioned. For FY 2018, we still don't anticipate an earnings headwind for the Corporate segment. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you again, Simon. Let me take a few moment to talk about Air Products' exciting future. Our team that are on the board feels very proud of what we have achieved in the last few years. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continue to provide us the opportunity to build on our success. As I said before, we now have the balance sheet and the organization to aggressively pursue growth. We remain very optimistic about Air Products future. While we cannot predict or control worldwide political or economic developments, we do have control over the operational performance and growth of Air Products and we are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitments. As Scott discussed, our very strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the capacity to invest at least $13 billion over the next five years. I continue to believe that we will be able to develop when and execute projects in our core Industrial Gas business, so that we can deploy all of this capital in the next five years. We continue to see great opportunities in mergers and acquisitions, asset buybacks and large new projects as well as significant number of more typical industrial gas projects. Now, please turn to slide number 20. We are all working very hard every day to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers. Continuing our positive momentum, we have again increased our guidance for the year to a range of $7.25 to $7.40 per share, at midpoint this is up $0.08 from the guidance we gave you last quarter, in part due to the closing of the Lu'An project. Our new guidance represents 15% to 17% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to grow EPS by at least 10% each year in the foreseeable future. For quarter three of fiscal year 2018, our earning per share guidance is a $1.80 to a $1.85, up 9% to 12% over last year. Including the Lu'An project, we now expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion in fiscal year 2018. Now, please turn to slide number 21. There, I want to point out, as I have done before, that we believe our real competitive advantage is the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. This is what allows us to generate the superior safety and operational performance that you can see today. I want to thank all of our 15,000 people around the world for their total commitment and hard work and I'm very proud to be part of this winning team. Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our first question today from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yes, a question on base business. Scott, you mentioned that if you take out Jazan, your volume was up about 10% – half new plant, half base business. That appears to be a pickup from last quarter when I think base business was only contributing about 2%. So, can you comment on the base business outlook, are merchant loadings improving? And as a result, should we be expecting some good incremental margins going forward from the base business?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Scott, would you like to...?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. As you pointed out, we had good performance on the base business across each of the geographies, fundamental improvements. And who knows what the future holds, but we feel as though the loadings will continue to improve. I think it's been mentioned in the past, we've been in Asia, we're in the low-80% capacity utilization and in Europe we've crept up to upper-70s, so that's improved as well. So, we feel very good about what we see in this quarter and are cautiously optimistic about the outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Don, this is Seifi, if I may add. We do see positive momentum in volumes and obviously if there is positive momentum on volumes, pricing will follow. So we are...
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: ...actually more bullish than we have been before.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And Seifi, what's the competitive environment for bidding on some of these major new projects? I assume your primary competitors have other issues that cause them not to be as aggressive in going after some of these new projects. So, who's the real competition and what does the competitive environment imply for returns on these new projects?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the competitive environment hasn't changed that much. Our major competitors are all very strong and they compete with us on every project. And the customers make sure that they get competitive bids. But as you know, we had a return expectation on these projects which we have disclosed very publicly, of at least 10% internal rate of return. And if because of the competitive pressure the returns are below that, we just don't take the projects. So that's our guiding principle, whether there is competition or not. We obviously have had a lot of good projects at significantly higher than that, but that is our threshold. And if another one of our competitors wants to take the project for lower return, then they get it.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question will come from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Could I just confirm that you're still in discussions to possibly acquire some of the assets for sale related to the Praxair-Linde merger?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: John, good morning. I cannot comment on that, please.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then, the $0.18 non-GAAP benefit in the quarter, could you just talk about what were the activities that generated that?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Was part of a restructuring of a acquisition that we did some time ago when we moved some legal entities and were able to get that sort of a benefit. And so, as I mentioned, some foreign subsidiaries, we made some adjustments that contributed to that.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Then, maybe if I...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We have been working on this thing for a while. It's a matter of the consolidation of some of the subsidiaries that when you consolidate it, you get a tax benefit. And that is what the number is.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: And then, maybe since the first question couldn't get answered, the unfavorable cost year-over-year on slide 12 that you had, what would you expect going forward without the TSAs and the CO2 reimbursement issue?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We will continue to have those kind of costs, because I mean it is a fact that we are working on a significant number of projects. And as you know, the current rules are – in the old times, when you were working on these projects out of your legal cost and your people cost and so on, you used to charge them to the project. Now, you can't do that. You expense it. So if they are going to deploy $13 billion, we need to bid on a lot of projects and we are bidding on those and we are expecting the costs. So that is a natural thing that is going to be with us as we win these projects.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next is Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, good morning. Can you comment just on the strength you said you were seeing down in Mexico? Is that just general Mexican economy getting better? Are you guys taking some market share down there? Is there something dynamic happening with your business?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Corning is kind of in charge of our business in Mexico and will make a comment. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I'd say in Mexico, we see improvement across several of the business lines. The packaged gas environment is good, there is a lot of infrastructure around pipeline projects that sort of thing that are going on and continue, and we've seen a pickup in the nitrogen injection for the oilfield business there, so I would like to say, relatively broad-based.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And just reminding....
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: ...everybody that's, of course, an equity affiliate for us, so you wouldn't actually see the volume in our reported numbers.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair. And then can you comment on the progression of the Lu'An City project? What's the timeline look like there and when might we get an announcement on that project?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We continue to make progress; that is a huge project and it involves a lot of different entities. I don't want to put a timeline on it, because from a negotiating point of view, we don't want to sound too anxious but we are working on it and it is moving forward, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Stephen Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you. What would you say the primary value drivers for owning and operating both the ASUs and the gasifier in the Lu'An project? Is there an operating efficiency that you have by having both? Has the combination improved the return on invested capital or is this an example of more gasifier projects that you would try to differentiate yourself for?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, there are several benefits. One is obviously operational efficiency and all of that that you mentioned. But the fundamental driver is that when we were just supplying the oxygen, we had deployed $300 million of our business at their return. Now, we are deploying $800 million of our business at the same kind of return or even higher. So that means that this is an opportunity for us to create growth, so that we can invest more capital at the kind of returns we are talking about. So I mean everybody gets excited about GDP going up 2% and creates growth, but like this, we are creating growth despite GDP. It gives us the opportunities to significantly deploy additional amount of capital.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then, Seifi, you always comment on the safety performance of the company. Would you say commensurate with that there has also been an improvement in operating efficiency of your facilities and/or less downtime?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, of course. Because look at our EBITDA margin. We have gone from 23%, 24% to 34%. That is almost $700 million, $800 million of improvement. Obviously, that has come up through the fact that the company is running better and is much more efficient. Yes. I think that is one of the reasons – I mean, safety is a moral responsibility. We don't want anybody to get hurt but a company who has a good safety record at the level that we are achieving definitely has excellent operational efficiency.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Next is Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about Merchant operating rates in North America as well? I think you've covered the other regions but didn't mention North America.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Corning, can comment on that.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, so we the termination of a very large long-term wholesale agreement. And I'd say we have largely replaced that on the LOX, LIN side. I think the argon is going to take a little bit longer. However, certain tightness in the argon market has certainly helped us to move that along. And today, I'd say, we are in the mid to slightly below mid-70s range in terms of our loading. But that's an improving story for us and I think the ground team has covered in replacing that volume is just tremendous performance.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And as far as crude oil prices moving higher, how do you see that factoring into your 2018 outlook? Is that a major tailwind for you?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Jim, we have always said that crude oil prices doesn't affect our business that much because we are not very involved in the upstream side of the oil business, so that's not going to be material to us.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Perfect. Thank you. Yeah. Can you just walk us through just an update on Jazan given a little bit of noise in the quarter and what your rough expectations are for the balance of fiscal year 2018? And more importantly, just anything preliminary on your thoughts on the cadence ramp in fiscal years 2019 and 2020? So, any thoughts on that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I'm sorry, Chris. The connection is not that great, so I didn't fully understand you. Simon, can you help me out?
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: So, Chris, I think your question was, Seifi, could you give an update on Jazan, kind of where we stand on the project and how it looks over the next couple of years?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry, Chris. I didn't hear you on the phone that I am. Chris, we are making...
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: My apology.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No, no problem at all. Not your fault. We are making excellent progress (00:39:01) on Jazan. We are ahead of schedule. We are close to 90% done with the project and we fully expect that to come onstream at the time that we expect it. So, we are – it's a very positive, a very positive story for us. It has demonstrated to our very, very important customer, Aramco, that Air Products can deliver and Air Products is capable of executing a $2 billion project in the middle of the desert. So, it's a very good story for us and it's a great achievement for our people. We are all very proud of that.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And just a second question on backlog. The vast majority of your backlog is overwhelmingly onsite sticky business, but can you comment on any particular end-markets you'd like to further increase your exposure to over time? Is CO2 something which you're paying incremental attention to given the recent transactions. Just any broad insight on your thinking there would be appreciated. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely, Chris. On a very macro basis, we always say energy environment and emerging market. But particular sectors we are very focused on the oil and gas sector obviously in the downstream side, specialty chemicals and also coal gasification. Those are the areas that we are very focused and there are significant amount of projects as you know. A lot of the major oil companies are switching from just providing crude to going downstream. You see a major shift in what Aramco is doing. There is the shift because of the cheap natural gas in the U.S. and there's obviously the coal gasification in China and there are significant large projects in emerging markets. So – and as I said, energy, environmental requirements and emerging markets; that's what we are focused on and we obviously like the onsite business.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, David. How are you doing?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, thank you. Seifi, just on Americas pricing, is pricing proving to be more difficult to get this cycle than prior cycles, and if so, why?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: David, pricing, we are selling in our LOX, LIN and LAR, basically, we are selling a commodity. Pricing is subject to supply, demand and utilization of our facilities. Industrial production in the United States in the last year-to-year is up around 4%. And we have always said that if you see industrial production go up, utilization rates going up then pricing will follow. So that's just the natural course of it and we seemed to be in that cycle right now. And if you see the results of everybody else, it points to that direction.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Overall, industrial production activity.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And just in Q3, you mentioned some additional maintenance costs in the Americas offset by the contract termination, could you quantify those elements that might impact Q3 Americas' profitability?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Quantifying it would be difficult because then we give too much information very competitively. But the fact is, as Corning mentioned, a lot of these plants that are undergoing so-called turnaround are very old plants that we have won contracts 20 years ago. The good news is that all of these contracts have been renewed. And therefore, this is a little bit of a life extension. Some of that we report in maintenance CapEx and some of that is on ordinary maintenance expenditure that goes to our bottom line.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: It's a positive development rather than a negative development.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, right. Okay. No, very good. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Next is Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Seifi, I'm just wondering as you think about over the next five years and the $13 billion, I mean, do you think there's going to be an opportunity to raise that sort of 10% minimum return target? I'm just thinking improving economy, rising interest rates, those types of things, think this would be an opportunity to bring that up?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Vincent, first of all, good morning. To answer your question, Vincent, when we say 10% – 10% is the minimum. We have won a lot of projects that's higher than that today. So whenever we are bidding on a project, we obviously – we do not price things on a cost basis. We price the things based on the competitive nature, and quite honestly, about the market there. So we have had projects which have been 15%, 16%; and the 10% that we keep mentioning is that that is our kind of bottom line; that below that, we don't take projects.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So nothing will change there. And just as a follow-up, could you just remind us what you're expecting from foreign exchange and guidance versus last quarter?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Scott, do you want to mention this?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure, sure. So let me take you through – thanks for the question, let me take you through. So, as we've mentioned this quarter we had versus prior year, currency impact of $0.09. And at a higher level, that's the euro is at RMB 0.03 and the pound is at RMB 0.02, and then everything else makes up for the remainder of about $0.02. That's on top of what we had last quarter of about $0.06. And as you know what we end up doing is we just moved sideways from wherever the latest rates are. So when we look forward now for the full year, currency would be kind of more on the closer to the $0.25, we had previously said maybe $0.10 to $0.15, but just on what's developed, it's more like $0.25. Let me also just for everybody, just to reiterate a couple of sensitivities that we try to provide you. So, first grounded in the – these are transactional exposure rates, there's no economics. It's just doing a mathematic – I'm sorry, translational exposure, it's just mathematics to bring it back into U.S. dollars. So, for the euro, a 10% swing of the euro is about $0.09 per year, EPS same with an RMB, 10% swing is about $0.09; and then the pound, the Korean won, the Tai dollar and the Canadian dollar, each individually would be about $0.03 to $0.04 on an annual basis EPS if there's a 10% swing. So I wanted to take you through that a little bit and share with you not only what we're seeing and projection for the year, but also the sensitivities. So, hopefully, that's helped.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, P.J. How are you doing?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good, good, Seifi. Seifi, do you consider syngas as a core industrial gas and when you bid for these projects like Lu'An or YK, are you running into other gas suppliers, the traditional competitors or is the field wide open for you?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No, we do run into them. They have their ambitions of their own, and in a lot of the projects that we have done, they have been there. They have relationship with these customers, so it's not as if we have a totally open-field and a lot of times our customers don't share with us exactly whom they are talking to, but we operate on the basis that on every project that we do, they are there and our competitors are very smart people, they see this thing as an opportunity and they are active.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, geographically, in which region do you think you have the highest leverage to incremental sales, or in other words, where do you think you have the highest incremental margins going forward?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Right now, the highest incremental margin that we have is actually the United States for the total business. It's around 42%. But as we move forward, we think the highest growth area for us will be emerging markets. It will be China, it will be Middle East, it will be places like, I mean, Russia and places like that. Those are the markets where there are significant growth opportunities in terms of the actual sales dollars. But in terms of margins, currently our highest margin region is the United States.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And now we'll go to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yes, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC: A number of companies across the chemical industry have cited rising logistics costs as a challenge. I'm wondering if you're seeing that, and if so, what mechanisms you have in place or might need in the future to combat that tension?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: For us, that is not an issue, Kevin. You know our business very well. Our business is very, very local; and the logistics would apply if you had an extensive packaged gases business, which we don't. So for us that is not an issue, Kevin.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Very good. And second, a question on China if I may. We've obviously seen a lot of supply restrictions for environmental reasons and those seemed to be more pronounced over the winter time. I'm wondering if there's any impact in the seasonality of Air Products business in China related to that or if that's not a factor and we can rely on historical patterns.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: There is no impact on us. You can rely on historical factors and beside that, the more pressure environmentally the better it is for us for the long-term, because then coal gasification becomes even more pronounced.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Understood. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we'll go to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Corning, I might have missed it, but could you give me a little more sense of in the Americas, how – I think you showed a $23 million sales improvement but operating profit actually declined, what were the components that drove that?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: So we had the base improvement. We had some of the cost items that Scott mentioned that, let's say, are a little bit less of an operating cost but still there in our P&L.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Scott, it seems like maybe at the margin since your last update on guidance, the FX number is a little better, you're throwing Lu'An in there now and you've got maybe the tax guidance is at the better end of things. I was a little surprised maybe there wasn't more ambition in the earnings path, is that a function of Jazan scaling down, is it a function of maybe some of these other costs continuing to stay elevated? Why not maybe a little bit more ambition on your guide?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Bob, we are raising by 8% our guidance. So we were at 7.15% to 7.35%; now we are at 7.25% to 7.40%. So we have increased the bottom of our estimate by at least $0.10. So, as we go forward, obviously it's very difficult to predict exactly what the economy does. We are seeing a positive momentum and obviously at the end of next quarter if things are positive, we will increase our guidance. But at this time we thought it's prudent to stay where we are, but we have given you all of the elements. But you can make a judgment about where we are conservative and where we are not.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff. How are you this morning?
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good. Maybe I'll try Bob's question in a different way. I think operating profit and EBITDA has been flat for the first half year-over-year even though you're growing your volumes in the Americas 4% or 5%. Shouldn't your returns be higher than what you're reporting?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, obviously, I would like it to be better. But we have – as Scott mentioned, Corning mentioned, some of the costs that we have in terms of some of the turnaround costs and some of the costs for pursuing other projects and all of that. And the fact is that we did have some one-offs that helped us last year that do not exist this year. So if you really take the one-offs off, we are up and we are – I obviously go through the details of this thing, for every dollar of incremental dollar of sales, we are getting $0.40 to the bottom line. So I'm not worried about the fact that we are losing margins and so on, but then you put all of that for a big company like us in aggregate, the result is what you see.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Earlier in the call, I think Scott commented on the decrease in return on capital employed year-over-year from 12.3% to 11.8%, and I think he attributed it to some one-time items. But if you look at the return on capital employed through the last four or five quarters, it keeps moving incrementally lower, and it looks like your incremental return on capital is around 9%. Can you talk about what's going on and whether that's noise or when you expect your return on capital to go up?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Scott is most qualified to answer that. And then if there is anything, I'll make a comment.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. And just back to my prepared remarks. So as part of the gain that we had, almost $2 billion in PMD that goes into the base of that calculation, that dilutes the ROCE calculation about 200 basis points. So that's my comment around – just the mathematics as it comes for five quarters in the denominator associated with the gain that we booked last year in PMD on the increment, so that's the math of that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Back to your basic question, around 10% minimum after-tax internal rate of return on all these projects and as those are done and as they come out of the backlog and start contributing, that will be accretive to the return on capital as well.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: One other thing that I would like to add, Jeff, is that the return on capital, the way you calculate it if you're comparing us to others, since we have a lot of cash, we are showing – that decreases if you actually – if we calculate our return on capital the way other people are calculating it, our return on capital is about 15%. So there is that subtle thing also.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Mike. How are you doing?
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Doing well. Thank you, Seifi. A couple of questions on the Lu'An JV and just kind of modeling-related question. You talked about that as receiving a monthly fee, should we think about that as being more of a tolling arrangement in which you receive a sort of relatively low revenues at relatively high-margins or do you end up taking any ownership of the raw materials which would make it higher revenue and lower margin?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We do not take any ownership of the raw material.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. So it's more of a tolling rate. Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Kind of, yes.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: And then in terms of you mentioned the annual EPS expectation of $0.25, but for fiscal 2018, you're only including $0.04, if I understood correctly in the guidance.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Is that due to some startup headwinds and how much should we think of those startup headwinds as costing you in the third and fourth fiscal quarters?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No. It's not a startup headwind, Mike. It is – there are four gasifiers, my friend. And we get paid the monthly fee based on these gasifiers coming onstream. So, obviously, they are not starting out of the four gasifiers at the same time. So when the first gasifier comes onstream, we get a certain amount. The second, the third and the fourth and we expect to have all of the four gasifiers onstream by 2019, which is in October and then we will get there, but we will get on an annual basis.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. If I can ask you one other question just related to the commentary on the LNG heat exchangers, obviously still under some pressure now but sounding like that activity is picking up. What's your forecast for maybe what that does as we look at 2019? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We have not seen and we are not expecting any substantial increase there, therefore we have said that we don't really expect that business to come out of the doldrums until 2020. But if it comes sooner that would be a positive but I don't expect it.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: And now we'll go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Mike.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Seifi, when you – Lu'An is going to be a nice contributor here in 2019. You have other projects. When I take a look at the major project slide coming on in 2019, how much can those contribute to earnings growth next year? And so, yeah – so that's the question.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We don't disclose that specifically, but I have said that we expect 2019 that we increase our EPS by at least 10%, so some of that will come from those. But if you don't mind, we don't want to disclose the specific contribution from new projects because then it makes it very easy for people to calculate exactly what our returns are and we don't want to do that.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow-up, your electronics market on that project slide has been a good area for you this year and in the backlog. How big of an opportunity – how much capital can you deploy in that market over the next couple of years?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, that market is growing very fast right now. I think this year if you add up, we probably have contributed more than $300 million of new projects in there. And what will happen next year, it depends on the new fabs that people build and all of that. But I love Corning to make a little bit more comment on this. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. I was just in China meeting with the team, which is where a lot of this activity is – China, Korea, and Taiwan right now. And I would say the prospect list is still quite robust for us, so we expect another good year of hunting.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And I like to add that we are very, very well-positioned by the way on that one. It depends on...
Operator: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. Could you clarify two things. My impression with the traditional onsites was that once you had the oxygen ASU up and running, you would be paid your fee regardless of if the customer was operating. But it sounds as if with the gasifiers; if the gasifiers are down in say 2020 or 2025, you would then lose that part of the revenue stream. I just wanted to see if that's correct or if that's a slightly different model?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No, no, no.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: And secondly – go ahead.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sorry to interrupt you. That is not the case. The reason that we are getting the fee is we are getting the fee right now for the startup. Once we get – we have all of the four gasifiers running, then in 2020, if because of the customers' demand only two gasifiers are needed to run, we still get our full BFC. So the model is exactly the same, it's adjusted during the startup period.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And then a second one I guess just to flog one of the previous horses again, I think you have made a comment that you were more bullish than you were on the last quarter about volumes and then price following in the Merchant business. FX is about a $0.10 tailwind. You get about a $0.04 or $0.05 from the JV but you're moving the range by only about $0.10. So the implication is that the growth investments or the efforts to pursue other growth projects is an incremental, maybe $0.05 or $0.07 kind of drag. Is that the way you're thinking about it or is it more just that you're allowing for some squishiness in the economy just because it's only halfway through the year and you just want to have that cushion? I guess what I'm getting at...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No, it's...
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: ...is are you ramping up growth investments to take advantage of the tailwinds?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I think I don't want to confirm or not confirm the exact numbers that you quoted, but we do see the positive effects of the FX, we do see the positive effect of Lu'An coming onstream right now. But as we have been saying, we do see higher maintenance cost because of the turnaround of some of the hydrogen facilities and we do see higher cost in terms of pursuing other opportunities. I mean, like – during the last year, it cost us $5 million that they had to absorb in our results. So those are the two principal reasons that we haven't increased our guidance by more than $0.10.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And gentlemen, there are no other questions at this time.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Very good. Well, in that case then, I would like to thank everybody again for being on the call. Thanks for taking time from your very, very busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We do appreciate your interest and look forward to discuss our results with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Thank you very much.
Operator: And thank you very much. That does conclude our conference for today. I would like to thank everyone for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals' First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon Moore: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2018 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release. Beginning this quarter, we adopted the new pension accounting standard. Adopting this accounting standard is required for all companies, we chose to adopt earlier than many. This new accounting standard does not impact pension or overall cost, or earnings per share but it does move the impact of non-service related pension costs to other non-operating income and expense. For FY17, this resulted in modest increase in operating income and EBITDA of about $4 million and increases margins by 10 basis points. This change provides a better reflection of our operating performance by moving the historically more volatile components of pension expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of deferred amounts to non-operating. Service cost remain in operating income as these represent the benefits earned in the current period by planned purchase events. Again, just to emphasize, this doesn’t change our pension and overall cost we just moved to small component of cost from within operating income to non-operating income. We view this updated historical information for prior period comparisons and the results reported today, and you can find a summary in an appendix slide and more detailed consolidated and segment information in the 8-K we filed today. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. Our talented and committed Air Products team delivered another excellent quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, our record earning per share of $1.79 was up 22% versus last year. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth. This is also the third consecutive quarter we have delivered EPS growth of more than 15%. We generated strong cash flow and are pleased to announce a dividend increase of 15% per share or 16%, the largest per share increase in our history. Our annual dividend is now $4.40 per share, which equals to returning almost $1 billion per year to our shareholders. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with EBITDA margin of over 33%. And most importantly, we have a great team, totally focused on delivering strong operating performance, while successfully winning exciting new growth opportunities. Now please turn to slide number three. You can see the significant progress we continue to make on improving our safety results with a reduction of 71% in our lost time injury rate and a reduction of 52% in our recordable injury rate. This improvement only happens when all of our 15,000 employees around the world are totally focused on safety and operational excellence. This same commitment is also driving our strong financial performance. Now please turn to slide number four, which is our goal for the company. As I shared on last quarter's call, we have elevated our commitment to diversity and inclusion by explicitly incorporating it in our goal. This does not dilute our focus on being the safest and most profitable. In fact, being the most diverse will contribute to maintaining our position as the most profitable industrial gas company over the long term. As I've always said, the degree of commitment and motivation of our people is the real sustainable competitive advantage that we have. We want to ensure that we are providing opportunities and the right environment for everyone to contribute and succeed in our company, regardless of their gender, color, race, religion, orientation, country of origin or any other dimension of diversity. Now please turn to slide number five. Our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times. We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation and an empowered and decentralized organization. On the slide number six, you can see our five point plan, which has been the roadmap to our success. Now please turn to slide number seven, where I would like to again remind everyone of the progress we have made in the last three years. We made promises and we have delivered. We have become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have divested our non-core assets and created the best balance sheet in the industry, and we have delivered greater than 10% per year EPS growth in each of the last three years, and our guidance for this year implies another year of over 10% growth. Now please turn to slide number eight. In summary, we have delivered what we promised and now we are well positioned to grow Air Products. The great thing is that we do have the balance sheet to do it. Now please turn to slide number nine to discuss the areas of opportunity for us to invest and move Air Products forward. First, acquisition of small and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets for businesses from other industrial gas companies. The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers, where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee under a long term contract. This is what we call asset buybacks and we see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category. We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units, to supply syngas to our customers based on long term contracts. Essentially, these opportunities is the same as our traditional onsite business model, something that we do every day, but with existing rather than new production assets. The Lu'An project we described before is a perfect example of this area of growth for us. We expect to do more of these in the coming years. And the third area of opportunity is very large industrial projects around the world, driven by demand for more energy, environmental requirements and energy market growth. The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these opportunities can be. The plant we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of the industrial gas industry, with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects that I am talking about can also include gasification and syngas supply. The Yankuang project that we announced is another great example of that. Now please turn to slide number 10 to discuss some of the -- or read some of our recent successes to grow Air Products in line with what I just described, which is consistent with our strategy. First, the tremendous opportunity for Air Products to expand our well proven onsite business model to supply syngas, and we have some great recent examples. In September, we announced the 1.3 billion Lu'An syngas joint venture. We continue to make progress on the necessary approvals and hope we can close on this joint venture at some point during fiscal year '18. However, as we did in October, due to some uncertainty in the timing of the necessary government approvals, we have not, and I'd like to stress, we have not included any contribution from Lu'An project in our EPS or CapEx guidance for fiscal year '18. We will continue to keep you updated on our progress. In November, we announced $3.5 billion syngas joint venture with Yankuang in China. We also continue to make progress on finalizing the contract, and we'll keep you updated. And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Shell's coal gasification technology supporting our syngas supply position and supporting our strategy in this area. Finally, earlier to speak, we announced an agreement to supply syngas to BPCL’s phase 2 petrochemical project in Kochi, India. Our new facility will be integrated with the large plant we brought on stream in 2017 to supply their refinery. In terms of acquiring assets and plans for the so called asset buyback that we have been talking about, in December, we announced an ASU asset buyback on long term industrial gas supply agreements for Jinmei Huayu in China. A great example of a customer becoming more comfortable with the outsourcing sale of gas model. And we recently signed and closed on another deal to acquire three existing large air suppression unit assets in China, and have began supplying customers and their long-term agreements. And finally, we continue to see great opportunities in the new industrial gas projects around the world. We announced new projects in China and Korea. Notably, these include major contracts expanding our supply to two of Samsung’s major sites in Korea. Finally, we continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and currently expect on stream in phases starting in fiscal year 2019. As I mentioned, yesterday we announced the largest dividend increase in Air Products’ history, continuing our commitment to retain cash to shareholders. Now please go to slide number 11, which shows you the results of our three key metrics for the quarter and the year. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three key metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvements as we move forward. Finally, please turn to slide number 12, which continues to be my favorite side. It is great to see sustainable margins in the mid 30% range and it reminds us how far we have come in only a few years. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon, to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you, very much Seifi. Before I discuss our results for the quarter, I would like to provide a brief summary of the impacts we expect the U.S. Tax Cuts in Jobs Act to have on Air Products. Please turn to slide 13. First, let me talk about the income statement impact for Q1. Although, the reduced U.S. tax rate under the new tax act was not affected until January 1, 2018, which is after the end of our fiscal Q1, this quarter's results reflect our estimated blended tax rate for the full year as required. Overall, the new tax act reduced our tax rate in Q1 by about 260 basis points, which increased EPS by about $0.06 per share. As you can see, the positive impact of the lower U.S. tax rate was partially offset by other tax act changes, including reduced benefits from the U.S. production activities deduction and changes to compensation deductions. For the full year 2018, we expect the new tax act to reduce our tax rate by about 250 basis points to 300 basis points to somewhere in the range of about 20% to 21%. This would increase EPS by about $0.20 per share to $0.25 per share. For fiscal year 2019, we expect a similar net impact as the full year effect of the lower U.S. rate is approximately offset by the repeal of the U.S. production activities deduction, and credits for foreign taxes and other changes that takes effect in 2019. So I would use about a 20% to 21% book effective tax rate to model Air Products going forward. Turning now to the tax related non-GAAP items this quarter that totaled a negative $239 million or $1.09 per share. Please keep in mind these are based on our current reasonable estimates. We had a charge of $453 million to recognize the liability associated with the deemed repatriation of the foreign earnings, with about $32 million recorded in equity affiliate income. The deemed repatriation tax will be paid over the next eight years. Partially offsetting the charge, we had a benefit of $214 million due to revaluing our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower tax rate. Finally, let me comment on the expected cash tax impact. There was no cash tax impact in Q1. For full year 2018, we expect a modest reduction in cash taxes from the new tax act of about $15 million to $20 million as the benefit from the lower corporate tax rate is mostly offset by the tax on the expected repatriation of foreign cash from subsidiaries and joint ventures. So we would still expect cash taxes in the range of about $400 million for 2018. For 2019, we expect a cash tax reduction from the tax act of about $70 million to $80 million with the positive impact of the full year of the lower tax rate, and the immediate expensing of capital investments being partially offset by the first payment of the deemed to repatriation of foreign earnings. Turning now to our Q1 results on slide number 14. As Seifi mentioned, this was another record quarterly EPS, congratulations to the whole Air Products’ team. Sales of $2.2 billion increased 18% versus last year as volume plus price were up 15% and currency added 3%. Volumes were up 13% with positive contributions from all three regions, driven by a new plants, a contract termination and associated plant sale in Asia and base business growth; the Asia plant sale was about 6% of the growth; new plants were about 5% and base business growth was about 2%; pricing was up 2%, driven by the China merchant business; currency was positive, driven by the Euro, British Pound and Chinese RMB. EBITDA of $735 million improved by 12%, driven by the higher volumes and China pricing. EBITDA margin of 33.2% was down 160 basis points. The Asia contract termination and plant sale negatively impacted margins by about 90 basis points, and the significant amount of energy pass-through on the hydrogen plant in India due to the high natural gas prices negatively impacted margins by 40 basis points. Excluding these two items, EBITDA margins were down 30 basis points, primarily due to higher planned maintenance cost. Let me provide some more background on the Asia contract termination and associated plant sale. One of our onsite steel customers in China had a change in ownership, and approached us to end our long term supply agreement with them and purchase the plant from us. The customer had no contractual right to do this, but we are satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation and are pleased to reduce our long term exposure to this customer. We recognize the sales and profit from the sale of equipment this quarter, but will not see the sales and profit from the sale of gas going forward. Sequentially, EBITDA was down 4%, primarily due to planned maintenance outage cost and lower OIE. Net income increased 23% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 22% versus prior year. ROCE of 11.9% declined by 80 basis points versus last year and 20 basis points sequentially despite the profit increase. This is because the denominator or the ROCE calculation has increased. The denominator is based on the five quarter average and this now includes four quarters with the significantly higher denominator as a result of the gain from the PMD sale. Please turn to slide 15. The only non-GAAP items we had this quarter were related to the new tax act, and totaled $1.09 per share as I discussed earlier. Our adjusted Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.79 increased $0.32 or 22% versus last year. As I mentioned, this includes the $0.06 benefit from the new tax act. Excluding this benefit, our EPS was still up 18%. Overall, higher volumes increased EPS by $0.19 per share. This includes $0.08 for the contract termination of plant sale in China. Price and raw materials taken together increased the EPS by $0.08, driven by the China merchant pricing. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.15 as we had some positive items last year that didn't repeat, as well as well as higher planned maintenance cost and inflation. As a reminder, included in the cost major factors, is the other income and expense line on the consolidated P&L. As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for this service was about $6 million this quarter and is shown in the other income and expense line. This is down from recent quarters as the Evonik TSA ended during Q1. We expect the Versum TSA to finish at the end of Q2. We remain committed to taking actions to reduce the cost associated with providing these services, but would expect to see a brief gap between the end of the TSA income and the cost savings. Currency and foreign exchange gains and losses were $0.06 favorable, primarily due to the Euro, British pound and RMB. Equity affiliate income added $0.03 due to underlying strength across a number of our JVs, particularly in Mexico. Note that this excludes the new tax act related charge I mentioned earlier. Other non-operating income added $0.04, primarily due to interest income. The overall tax rate was an $0.08 benefit versus last year with $0.06 due to the new tax act. Interest expense, non-controlling interest and shares outstanding totaled $0.01 unfavorable. Now please turn to slide 16. We had another strong cash flow quarter in Q1 with distributable cash flow up almost $100 million to over $500 million. You'll see we've an updated slide that more closely aligns with our current situation. Investible cash flow is the amount of cash we have discretion or choice to deploy. It is after we pay interest, taxes, maintenance CapEx and dividends. Certainly, dividend payments create value, and given our 36 year track record of raising dividends, we don't expect this to change. We then think of funding our growth capital, including acquisitions from our cash and balance sheet capacity, as well as from our investible cash flows. Investible cash flows what we've been describing is more than $1 billion per year. You can see we generated almost $350 million of investible cash flow in Q1. As Seifi mentioned, we did close on a few acquisitions during Q1 and have included these in our CapEx and earnings guidance. Our total growth CapEx for Q1, including the acquisitions is about $400 million. Again, we think investible cash flow is now the right metric as it represents the cash generated that we can choose how to deploy in order to create shareholder value. Turning to slide 17, I would like to update you on our capital deployment capacity. As I just mentioned, we view this capacity as available to enable projects and acquisitions. We have just over $3 billion of cash and short term investments as of December 31st. After maintaining a modest operating cash balance, we have just under $3 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of December 31st is about $3.5 billion. As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA of $2.9 billion, this would support a debt level in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion. So in total, between our available cash and additional debt capacity, we've about $6 billion we can deploy today while maintaining our A/A2 rating. As I discussed on the previous slide, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investible cash that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx, and dividends. So over the next three years, we expect to have a total of at least $9 billion available to invest, not including extra capacity created by EBITDA contributions from investing in profitable projects. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning Painter: Thanks, Scott. Volumes for all three industrial gas regional segments were up this quarter from a combination of new plants coming onstream, overall stronger merchant sales and the China plants that Scott mentioned. The volume strength was broad based, covering a wide range of end markets. Pricing was also positive across the regions with Asia and particularly China posting the biggest gain. I would like to thank our team for staying close to our customers, driving competitiveness and creating growth opportunities. Now please turn to slide 18 for a review of our gases Americas results. For the quarter, sales were up 5% on higher volumes, hydrogen demand was strong, particularly in the Gulf Coast as were North American merchant volumes, even including the impact of the end of a large wholesale contract. Its not so much that we replaced the wholesale volume molecule by molecule, plant by plant. By taking advantage of opportunities in one market, say higher activity in the oil patch, we offset impacts elsewhere. Going forward, we would expect to replace the liquid oxygen and nitrogen more quickly than the liquid argon, which will advance in year-on-year sales comparison. In Latin America, we also achieved higher merchant gases volumes versus prior-year. Overall, pricing impact was slightly positive but rounded to flat as higher North American pricing was partially offset by negative mix. EBITDA was up 1% compared to prior year as contributions from higher volumes and better equity affiliate income more than offset higher planned maintenance outage costs and the wholesale contract termination impact. These factors and lower margin sale of equipment caused the margin to be down 160 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA was down 12% and margin was 310 basis points lower, primarily driven by the planned maintenance, outage costs, seasonally weaker volume demand and the wholesale impact. As we move into Q2, we’ve seen some modest negative customer demand and feedstock and utility impacts from the very cold weather in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Now, please turn to slide 19, to review our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. Sales were up 29% with volumes up 17%, energy costs pass through up 3% and currency up 9%. Our new hydrogen plant in India completing its second full quarter of operation drove a significant portion of the sales growth, while our merchant business contributed 3% volume growth. As a reminder, this 100% owned India hydrogen facility is reported in the EMEA segment while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in the Asia equity affiliate income. Overall, pricing was slightly positive but rounded to flat as higher real pricing was partially offset by customer and product mix. EBITDA was up 18% compared to prior year, again primarily due to the new plant in India with higher-merchant sales and positive currency also contributing. EBITDA margin of 32% was down 320 basis points, almost completely due to higher energy cost pass through versus last year and the new plant in India, which has comparatively higher natural gas costs. Excluding these factors, EBITDA margin was down only 20 basis points, primarily due to a large planned maintenance outage in the quarter. EBITDA was down 9% sequentially on the planned outage cost, lower OIE and higher seasonal power costs. Please turn to slide 20, gases Asia, where our business continue to deliver strong growth, strong sales and profit growth. Sales were up 47%, including the sale that Scott mentioned earlier. Excluding this, underlying sales were still up 15%. Underlying volumes were up 8%, driven by new plant on streams and 3% contribution from the merchant business. Pricing for the region was up 7%. In addition to strong base merchant pricing, we had a particularly significant spot sale, which concluded in January and will not repeat. We expect the supply and demand balance to ease in Q2 with the Chinese New Year. But coming out of that, we believe the underlying fundamentals remain positive and I know our team is working diligently to maintain pricing momentum. EBITDA was up 38%. Excluding the contract termination and plant sale, EBITDA increased 26% due to the strong volumes, higher pricing and favorable currency. We are incurring higher distribution and sourcing costs to support our growing retail business. We think this is the right course of action, and the new business is certainly contributing. EBITDA margin, excluding the contract termination and plant sale, was up 240 basis points. As Seifi mentioned, we announced the number of exciting new projects in Asia for coal gasification to produce syngas, ASU purchases and two awards for new long-term supply agreements with Samsung in Korea. The team is doing a great job of winning new opportunities, while continuing to execute on the base business, productivity and safety. Finally, please turn to slide 21 for a brief comment on our global gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sales equipment business, as well as central industrial gas business cost. Sales were down $15 million while profits were up slightly, driven by the Jazan project. We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and as we have said, expect on-stream in phases in early fiscal 2019. Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a comment on our corporate segment.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 22. Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our Helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales and profits were down, primarily driven by lower LNG project activity. For FY18, we still don’t expect an earnings headwind for the corporate segment. Now I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about Air Products' future. As I discussed earlier, we are very proud of having delivered on our promises from two years ago. And we are excited about the strong opportunities that we have to build on our success. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continues to be strong. We continue to be optimistic about the future of Air Products. We obviously cannot predict and we do not have control over worldwide political or economic developments. But we do have control over the operational and growth performance of Air Products, and we feel confident we can continue to deliver on our goals. As you know, our portfolio actions and the strong cash flow generation of our company provides us with an expected capacity of over $9 billion to invest over the next three years. I truly believe that Air Products will be successful in utilizing our balance sheet, the best in the industry, to invest in our four industrial gases business to create significant value for our shareholders. We see great opportunities in mergers and acquisitions, asset buybacks and large new projects, as well as a significant amount of more typical industrial gas projects. Rest assured, we are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident that the risk return profile will create significant value for our shareholders. Now please turn to a slide number 23. Our great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented and motivated employees remain focused on being the safest and most profitable and diverse industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Continuing our positive momentum, we have increased our guidance for fiscal year 2018 to a range of 715 to 735. This is up $0.30 from the guidance we gave you last quarter. As Scott mentioned, $0.20 to $0.25 of this is coming from the new tax act, with the remaining increase from improved confidence in our business performance. Our new guidance represents 13% to 16% growth over our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to grow EPS by at least 10% every year. For quarter two of fiscal year 2018, our earning per share guidance is $1.65 to a $1.70, which is up 15% to 19% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This includes approximately $0.05 from the new tax act. Excluding the tax act impact, our quarter two guidance is still up 12% to 15% over last year. Including our quarter one acquisitions, we now expect our capital spending to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2018. As I mentioned before, and I'd like to stress this, our EPS and CapEx guidance do not include any contribution from the Lu'An project or any future M&A opportunity. We are certainly working on other opportunities that could potentially add to our results in fiscal 2018, but have not included any other significant acquisition in our guidance for now. Now please turn to slide number 24. We remain committed to our goal of being the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We will continue to focus on safety, controlling our cost and investing in the many strategic growth opportunities that we see. Now please turn to slide number 25, where I want to point out once again that we believe our real competitive advantage is the motivated and committed people of Air Products. Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment of our drivers to transport our products in all kinds of severe weather conditions to deliver product to our customers. Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment from our operators and maintenance workers who day in and day out work hard to keep our plans running even during severe hurricanes and other challenging conditions to ensure reliable supply to our customers. Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment of our sales people who work hard every day to develop and bring in new opportunities to Air Products by creating value for our customers. Our competitive advantage comes from the commitment and motivation of the rest of our team all over the world who work hard to run our company to the highest level of performance. Yes, our competitive advantage comes from the commitment and motivation of our people. I consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team. Now we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Seifi, just on the India syngas project. Are there any metrics you can share with us on that project?
Seifi Ghasemi: Did you say are there any…
David Begleiter: Any financial metrics you can share with us on that project?
Seifi Ghasemi: The return on that project is well above the guidance that we've told you, which is so called 10% internal rate of return, it's well above that.
David Begleiter: And capital to be deployed in this project?
Seifi Ghasemi: We cannot disclose the exact amount of the capital, David, but it is not a $1 billion project.
David Begleiter: And just on pricing Seifi what type of price traction are you seeing in the U.S. and Europe, and when you think we can get a little more positive pricing in the core merchant gas business?
Seifi Ghasemi: David, as you know, we don't want to be commenting on pricing for the future. But the pricing of what has happened in the past, we can comment on that and that has been positive, and I'd like Corning to expand on that. But as far as future pricing, because of the nature of our industry, we don't want to comment on that. But Corning?
Corning Painter: Yes, so I think your questions are probably about Europe and the Americas. Obviously, in Asia it's quite a strong story for us. Both in Europe and in the Americas, we have positive net pricing. So same molecule, same customer year-on-year have been able to move those prices? Yes we have. We do have a challenge with mix, which is typically larger customers just simply growing more in the current environment, taking more product year-on-year and in some degrees, mix of which molecules are being bought. But I'd say there's, in terms of real activity and real pricing, meaning same customer, same molecule, there's progress.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: When you look at your backlog, how much of your backlog has been hydrogen and syngas and how much of your backlog has been the traditional industrial gases, oxygen and nitrogen, argon, those sorts of things.
Seifi Ghasemi: Approximately 40% is syngas and about 60% is the traditional business.
Jeff Zekauskas: And in commentary, you said that repatriation impacts would be about negative 453 and then there's the revaluation of deferred taxes. And you netted that out to $239 million. Should we look at that $239 as the amount of additional cash taxes that you'll pay over the next eight years, excluding the annual changes to your normal corporate rate?
Seifi Ghasemi:
I :
Corning Painter: And maybe if I could just build on that, Jeff, I feel obviously with the deferred taxes, there is some timing that might even go further out. But it’s a reasonable way to think about it. Its just in the timeframe of the eight years maybe we have to take that a little longer.
Operator: We will take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Just wanted to flush out a little bit more of the plant sale. So just going off your 20% in the volume number in the Delta that Corning gave of 12% EBITDA. If you calculate it, is about $130 million sale price in about $22 million of profit that you recognized in EBITDA. Is that the right way to strip out to get an underlying?
Seifi Ghasemi: As usual, Duffy, you are very good at doing your math.
Duffy Fischer: And then if I assume that you sold it for about 12 times, would that mean that the underlying profit that’s going to go away that we’ve seen from plant historically is about $10 million a year or $2.5 million a quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well no, that’s not the correct way of looking at that. But I think we can go through that detail offline with -- Simon can give you a lot more detail on that.
Duffy Fischer: And then just the last one, Seify. With the syngas stuff, how big in the portfolio would you be comfortable letting the syngas project to get over the next two or three years?
Seifi Ghasemi: We are shooting for about 40%.
Duffy Fischer: Well that’s 40% of the backlog. So I am just wondering like you had talked before about having $8 billion or so to invest over a number of years. Half of that, all of it, how much of it could being in syngas at the end of the day?
Seifi Ghasemi: Right now, we are targeting more than 50%.
Operator: We will go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs for a question.
Bob Koort: Maybe one for Scott, if I could. On slide 15, I might have missed this, Scott, but you show a price component and a cost component to the EPS. Can you talk why the costs were up 2x the price?
Scott Crocco: On cost we had -- lots of things that happened last year. Good news items that didn’t repeat, as well as in this quarter we had some higher planned maintenance. And of course, as always, we have inflations. So those would be the key items that are driving the cost year-on-year. I will also point out that in the price raw materials is there any changing in power and input cost are netted in there. So that is price net of those input costs and still recovered $0.08 above, which is separate from the cost item down below.
Bob Koort: And then Seifi, if I could follow up. Within China, obviously, there is a lot of environmentalism that seems beginning some traction, and maybe a move away from coal as a fuel source. Can you talk about how that’s impacting it all, the growth potential for coal to go into liquids and chemicals?
Seifi Ghasemi: That is obviously a very positive development for us, because the push obviously from an environmental point of view is to use less coal for producing power. But we are talking about here in the projects that we are pursuing is turning the coal, especially high sulfur coal into environmentally friendly way by gasifying it and producing chemicals. So all of the push for the environmental thing is actually very positive thing for us and that is why if you study the details of China's 13 and five year plan, there is a significant number of projects designated for coal gasification. And we are obviously very much involved in that.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Capital.
DonCarson: Question on the merchant business, I can see the merchant operating leverage in China and the margin impact it had there. What's going on in say North America and Europe, can you talk about merchant operating rates? How much they are going up and what incremental operating leverage we can expect?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'll have Corning to address that.
Corning Painter: So in North America, we of course has the challenge of absorbing a loss of a large wholesale agreement that we had. We still published overall positive volumes for merchant. I just want to say that's a good accomplishment by the team. But it’s both same factors when we report out our numbers that Scott mentioned that are challenge in that, so the higher maintenance cost and some positives from last year not repeating. The new business that we’re signing, however, is certainly the contributing to the overall results.
Seifi Ghasemi: But Jeff to be very specific, the operating rates right now in U.S. and Europe, are around 75%. Usually in industrial gases business when your operating rates gets to around 80% then you have significant pricing leverage and that is what is happening in China. But that is not the case yet in U.S. and Europe.
Donald Carson: Then Seifi a follow-up on capital deployment. If you look at all of the projects you signed in the roaster you've given, how much of that $9 billion total have you deployed thus far?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well quite frankly, if you add up the projects that we have announced and some of them are in the process like the big Yankuang project and so on, out of that $9 billion, about almost $4 billion of it is committed.
Operator: For our next question, we will go to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: Scott mentioned this a little, but in IG Americas, there was some planned maintenance around which hit margins, but volumes appear pretty solid in the merchant business, as well as hydrogen. Can you just give a little more color on these fronts just for the balance of the year and just anything of note will be greatly appreciated? Thanks.
Seifi Ghasemi: I think I'll turn it over to Corning to expand on that. But what I want say is that these so called planned maintenance cost are -- basically the big money is in our hydrogen facilities and those things, the timing of those, is not under our control, it's under control of our customers. And a lot of our customers are having turnaround this year, and each one of these turnarounds is $20 million to $30 million of expense. So that it's timing, but it is a necessary thing that we need to do. Corning?
Corning Painter: Yes, so I think you’re just interested in the market conditions. So I’first say I think underlying hydrogen demand remains really quite strong. And we've seen a little bit in this period as we had the cold weathers in the Gulf coast, but I would say we bounce back from that very quickly. And at this point, our customers are pretty nearly fully backed as well. Oil field services is probably a change for the higher oil field prices. We see more nitrogen going into that market. But by enlarge, I'd say there’s just broad based strength in North America right now.
Christopher Parkinson: And just a quick derivative question from trends in the Chinese merchant market in terms of lines and price. Can you just comment on any remaining supply side dynamics that would help maintain the momentum in fiscal year '18? Are there still additional facility closures, steel for instance? Or do you believe the comps will become more difficult as you progress throughout the year? And then just also any quick comments on regional demand trends if you have any by end market would be helpful? Thanks.
Corning Painter: So I think, first of all, I’d maybe take those in reverse order, cause I think the key point there is, there's just broad based industrial momentum in probably the world today. But China being to certain degree a workshop for the world, there's broad space demand growth there. Obviously, the coastal area is a little bit stronger than inland. We're going to see the Chinese New Year impact. It'll be interesting to see how quickly the volumes rebound from that. Coming out of that, I would expect the overall supply demand dynamics to remain very positive for the industry. We had last year the shutting down of the induction furnaces. I think what we're going to see is some new demand perhaps from furnaces that'll probably strengthen as we come into the coming year. All in all, I think it's going to remain a positive dynamic for us.
Seifi Ghasemi: I'd just like to stress on that Chris that we are very positive about the developments in China.
Operator: For our next question we'll go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Pete on for Jim. Do you see any significant acquisition opportunities outside of China? And along those lines, can you quantify how much of the Praxair Linde divestitures you might be interested in bidding for?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, in terms of M&A opportunities, we do see opportunities outside of China. I don't want to say more than that, but we are working on some of that. In terms of the Praxair and Linde thing, we have to wait and see what actually comes out. But we have always said that out of what we think they have to divest, we don't have any inside knowledge on this thing. But out of what we think they have to invest, there will be an opportunity for us to compete in about $1 billion to $1.5 billion of sale, which would have about probably about $300 million to $350 million of EBITDA. And obviously, when and if that thing comes into play, we will be interested in that for sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Is your interest in coal derived syngas driven more by growth prospects for that process, or would you say you bring to it a technological advantage, given coal derived gasifications been around a long time over there. Do you have a technological advantage, either from your ASU technology or with the Shell technology you acquired. Is it demand or technology driven?
Seifi Ghasemi: It is actually both, the demand is obviously there. And then in order to put ourselves in a competitively advantageous position, we not only bring our knowhow in terms of ASUs and operations and maintenance of large facilities, but our competitors have that. But that is the primary reason that we wanted to buy the Shell technology, because now we will have a technological advantage.
Steve Byrne: Does any royalty bearing revenue come with that technology?
Seifi Ghasemi: Not much.
Steve Byrne: And on the demand side, would you say that most of these new projects that are coal derived syngas are incremental production capacity projects or retrofits of old gasifiers that are inefficient and air polluting and need to be shuttered?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, none of the old gasifiers are polluting, gasification is a very clean way of using coal. Most of these opportunities that you're talking about are Greenfield plants.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Scott, maybe I could just ask you to give us some help on Americas margin sequentially, just given you had the maintenance in this quarter, the wholesale thing and then are there any positive things that's replaced last year that wont’s recur in the second quarter. But just how should we think about margins sequentially?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we obviously think that the margins are going to be competitive. But I'd like to hand it over to Corning to expand on that. Let's just make it very clear. We do remain very bullish about opportunities for industrial gases, our conventional business around the world. We think China is growing, U.S. is growing, Europe is growing and our margins, but we are losing any margin, it is just quarter-by-quarter. So fundamentally, we are very confident about what's going on and we are actually feel pretty strong about that. But, Corning?
Corning Painter: So just building on everything Seifi just said. So we feel that the underlying demand merchant gases, hydrogen and the whole package remains very strong. We're going to have other maintenance during the course of the year. And so sequential-to-sequential, we don't really map out exactly as our maintenance spending is coming out. But I would say the overall picture one that's strengthening in the Americas.
Vincent Andrews: And then maybe just as a follow-up for Seifi. I guess that there’s now $5 billion less that hasn't been allocated out to $9 billion from answer to previous question. Given the change in the tax environment in the United States, are you focused at all anymore or focused at all incrementally on putting some of that money to work in the U.S.? Does that change your investment calculus at all?
Seifi Ghasemi: Listen, on that one, if there's any project that we can go after, our number one priority is to spend our money in the United States, because of a lot of good reasons. So the fact that we are investing in other parts of the world, doesn't mean that we are not focused in the U.S., we are very focused in the U.S. And if there's any project that we can go after, we will go after in the U.S., that's our number one priority for investing. There's no question about that. The issue is that there're not that many opportunities, right now; but we are absolutely focused on that; we need to push everyday on every single project; and I hope in time, we will announce some big ones in the U.S. too.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: With regards to the cold weather along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Do you expect that to be good, bad, or neutral to your results in the fiscal second quarter? Just trying to think about the net effect of how are costs versus any customer outages that you see?
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you Kevin for the question. Corning, can answer that.
Corning Painter: Kevin, I think when we have a disruption in the market, it's never a positive for us. But I would just say the guidance that we have given reflects our expectations for the quarter, including what's happened in terms of weather.
Kevin McCarthy: And then as a follow up, if I may, for Seifi. Can you expand upon the China contract termination. What motivated your steel customer to want to purchase the plant from you? And I think you mentioned that you were pleased with the development. Perhaps you can expand on that as well.
Seifi Ghasemi: Corning can expand on that, go ahead.
Corning Painter: So we had a contract with a customer. that customer then got acquired by another steel company, who was less bought in, let's say, into the sale of gas concept. We have a good contract. They wanted to just -- and are basically good faith negotiations, understanding their thought process, how they look to things. We thought the termination that we came up with was a good win-win for us. I just point out in the same quarter, we have examples of where we've taken a plant that was going to be an SOE and we’ve converted it into a cell of gas. So I think there're some do and some don't in China that we continue to progress the transformation of that market to be more of a traditional industrial gas environment.
Seifi Ghasemi: And Kevin, it was very simply the fact that the new owners of the steel -- the way they do their financials and all of that, they decided that their cost of capital is on all of that that they rather own the plant rather than us supplying it. It’s just preference of the customer. And we always are obviously do what the customer wants to do. And the transaction financially was also very effective for us. And so they have put that money to work at a higher return.
Corning Painter: And I would say being our flexibility in changing had a lot to do with the fact that it was a new customer stepping in.
Operator: We will go now to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Quickly, can you explain the advantage of your strong balance sheet. When you’re bidding for this large ASUs and large syngas plant in China? And then what kind of competitors or competition do you run into for these large projects?
Seifi Ghasemi: We are running through the standard competitors, you know who they are and we compete with them on the basis of -- its not just the price, I would like to make -- its not just the financial returns, it’s the combination of the trust that -- relationship that we have with the customer, the demonstration that we have delivered, our technology. Now we are going to have an advantage with the acquisition of the Shell technology. So it’s a combination of all of things like we compete and we compete with the people basically that we have been competing with for many years.
P.J. Juvekar: And you talked about the environmental advantage of coal gasification. What are the risk to coal gasification? Let's say, if China implements carbon tax in the future. Will that impact the economics of the project?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that if they implement -- about this coal gasification do P. J., the coal gasification is producing chemical. So whatever tax they put in, it just increases the price of the chemical, because they can't say okay I'm not going to do coal gasification. So if you are not going to do coal gasification, what are you going to do? Then you have to buy out of these chemicals and import them into the country. The fundamental thing is that coal is the only energy source that China has. As a result, their only option, if they want to be independent, is to turn that coal into chemicals and syngas. Otherwise, they would have to import that, which is what they do right now. That is why this is a high priority for the government. And coal gasification has the advantage of being able to use 2%, 3% high sulphur coal that you cant do anything else with it. So it's financially very attractive.
Corning Painter: Can I just build on it. So, the gasification has a set in which you remove that sulphur after we gasified it. So I mean literally coal which you can't really legally use in other applications, you can use it here because we're going to get the sulphur out. And another element is that there was an incentive around carbon capture. Coal gasification has the benefit of giving you a very concentrated stream of CO2 that would be easier to work within almost any other process.
Seifi Ghasemi: The center point about what Corning just said is that if you are building any kind of a facility to produce syngas, gasification is the process where the CO2 that you produce is what is called capture ready. You can actually capture that and then put into for enhanced oil recovery in a lot of other applications.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Scott, tax reform didn’t start until January 1. So this fiscal September '17 I guess has three quarters of benefit. And I assume the December quarter recruit essentially a quarter of those three quarters of benefit. I am just trying to understand why the tax rate is even lower in the December quarter? And will this fiscal ‘19 tax rate go down a little bit more, because you'll have four quarters of benefit in '19?
Scott Crocco: So first in terms of our base underlying rate. You’re absolutely right. We have one quarter 35, three quarters of [20 million]. We’re required to take an estimate and blend that together. So it's that underlying with the 24.5. But as you pointed too, we had a even after adjusted for the new tax act. We had a little bit lower ATR here in the first quarter, principally driven by the accounting for share based compensation. So when we look at that and we talked about in total versus last year, maybe we’re down about 370 basis points. Now 260 of which is coming from the tax act and the balance of that 110 is from the share based comp. And so I think as I said in my prepare remarks then to going forward, for the full year, maybe it's a 20 to 21 rate to be used. And then when we look at it at the timing and the implementation of the various elements of the tax act, you’ve got to -- at this point in time, these are all best estimates. But I think that's a reasonable type of the rate we carry into 19 as well.
John Roberts: And then Corning, could you remind us why you split India between EMEA and Asia. Is it how you have your hydrogen group reporting up globally versus maybe regional on the industrial gas on the atmospheric gas side?
Corning Painter: Yes, I would say that's a reflection of -- at point in time when we did that. Clearly, at this point, we’re tremendously beefing up our syngas capabilities in Asia, however.
Seifi Ghasemi: But in terms of reporting that you are talking about, in terms of how we report that, quite honestly traditionally, we have been reporting that that way and we didn’t want to change that, if not to confuse the numbers. But on operationally, we run Middle-East and India separate from Europe. But in terms of the reporting the results, we put all of that together because we didn’t want to create a lot of confusion about comparison to previous years.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: In terms of the underlying improvement and the Asia margin performance this quarter, as I exclude the impact of the plant sales. Is that really just the impact of the pricing improvement there? Can you maybe talk about other dynamics that are at work there, helping your margin and how sustainable that is, going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Corning has two pages of details on that. And so he'll answer your question.
Corning Painter: I think, the big positive for us in Asia is pricing right now and you'd add on to that volume leverage and incremental loading, it’s those things that are pulling us forward. I would say maybe if you're just building on it like a highly motivated team that's again organized by sub-regions all of them with our own incentive plan on their own actual results. So they are just driven to let’s get the volume and let's get the price, and let's take advantage of this opportunity to absolutely the fullest.
Mike Harrison: And you haven't commented on where your capacity utilization rates are for LOX/LINin China. But I know one of your competitors mentioned that they're running over 90%, which is the point at which we might get concerned or expect to see from capacity additions. Are there any expectations on your part to debottleneck or otherwise add merger capacity in China over the next year or so?
Corning Painter: I don't think we want to really give a clear roadmap exactly where all our strategic options are in China, at this point. Clearly, it’s an area of opportunity though and we're quite focused on that.
Mike Harrison: And if I can sneak one more in, Seifi. Any updated thoughts on share repurchase opportunities.
Seifi Ghasemi: Not interested.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Lawrence Alexander with Jefferies.
Lawrence Alexander: Just very quickly discuss on the EBITDA margin. Can you give a little bit more detail on how much of a tailwind you had globally from merchant pricing in the quarter. And then going forward, if we're thinking out to 2019, 2020. Are the acquisitions of plants and the syngas projects, both margin accretive or does one offset the other to some extent. And do you have any onsite business, any pools of assets that are below the take or pay threshold, such that volume growth does not translate into profit growth if this strength in the end market continues for the next couple of years.
Scott Croco: This is Scott. Let me take the first one. The impact from pricing is maybe 50 basis points or so, something like that at the company…
Seifi Ghasemi: But overall, Lawrence -- overall when you look at the projects that we have taken and the onsite projects that we have taken and as they come onstream, their margins, they are not going to have a negative effect on our margins. Therefore, we expect to maintain an EBITDA margin, as we have said before, of somewhere between around 32% to 35%. And none of the projects that we have taken is going to cause that margin to go down. Actually, some of them might actually improve the margin.
Lawrence Alexander: I guess, if you can just clarify that a little bit. If your merchant pricing already before things get tight is a 50 basis point tailwind then over three or four years, it's probably going to be a little bit more of a tailwind from here. And if your rest is basically flattish, shouldn't you be to overshoot the 35% or what's the offset that you see?
Seifi Ghasemi: You're getting us into trying to give guidance now for '19 and '20. But I think you are on the right track to assuming that the overall conditions are positive for Air Products and our margins and we agree with that, but I don't want to...
Operator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Seifi Ghasemi for any final remarks.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much. With that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call. Thanks for taking time from your busier schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the best. Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals' Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter 2017 earnings release teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and in today's earnings release. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. The talented, committed and dedicated team of Air Products, our people, delivered an excellent set of results. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, our earnings per share was up 18% versus last year, and for all of fiscal year 2017, earnings per share was up 12%. This is the 14th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-on-year EPS growth. This is also the third consecutive year that we have delivered earning per share growth of more than 10%. We generated strong cash flow and returned about $800 million of that to our shareholders through dividends. We continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world with EBITDA margins of over 34%. We have a great team that is totally focused on delivering strong performance day-in and day-out. Ultimately, our success is built on providing excellent service to our customers. We are committed to providing them with the right innovations and solutions to make their processes better. Now please turn to slide number 3. You can see the significant progress we have made on improving our safety results, a reduction of 75% in our lost time injury rate. This result is a clear indication that all of our 15,000 employees around the world are totally focused on safety and operational excellence. This focus is also a significant driving force for our strong financial performance. Now please turn to slide number 4 which was our goal for the company. As I explained at the beginning of this call, we have made great progress and are determined to continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. At the end of this call, I'll talk about modification that we have made to our goal to include the diversity and inclusion as a significant part of our goal as we go forward. Now please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you about many times. We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation and an empowered and decentralized organization. Now please turn to slide number 6, where you can see, the one that you have seen many times before, our five-point plan which is the foundation of our success. Please turn to slide number 7, where I would like to take a few minutes to remind everybody of the progress we have made in the last three years. Specifically, I want to talk about the promises we made three years ago, and the results we have actually delivered. In 2014, we made several commitments to ourselves and to our shareholders. And as I recall, there may have been some skepticism in the investment community at the time, about our ability to deliver these results. So, let's update you on where we are today. Three years ago, we said that Air Products would be the safest industrial gas company in the world. We would be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We would divest our non-core assets. We would have the best balance sheet in the industry. And we would deliver 10% earnings per share growth every year. I am very proud of our team for delivering on every one of these promises. On slide 8, you can see the result of the first two commitments. We are today, the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have delivered significant improvement in our employee lost time injury rate, and we have an EBITDA margin of 34% which is up 900 basis points versus three years ago. On a slide number 9, you can see our success in divesting on our non-core assets. We sold our chemical business to Evonik for almost 16 times EBITDA, and I'm convinced that this business and the people involved, will thrive in Evonik. We spun-off our Electronics Materials business as an independent company called Versum Materials. The Versum team is 100% focused on the electronic market as a leading material supplier. They have delivered strong results, and the Versum stock is currently trading at almost 14 times EBITDA in fact a higher multiple than Air Products right now. Now please turn to slide number 10, which shows the result of our improved business performance and the successful transactions that we have made. Air Products has the strongest balance sheet in the industry. So we are well positioned to take advantage of the tremendous growth opportunities that we see in Industrial Gases. This is our future growth and as you can see we delivered EPS growth of 10% in 2015, 16% in 2016 and 12% in 2017. Now please turn to slide number 11 to summarize, the hardworking and committed team at Air Products has delivered on what we promised, and what is most exciting to me right now is that we are very well positioned to grow Air Products and create significant further value for our shareholders. We now have the balance sheet to do it. Now please turn to slide number 12 for a summary of our fiscal year 2017 accomplishments. I previously mentioned, the Versum spin and PMD sales. I want to thank the very hard working teams at Air Products, we have successfully executed our major projects. We brought on-stream a very large hydrogen project in India, a large air separation plant in Korea and our seventh large plant in China, providing oxygen to coal gasification. We continue to make great progress on the Jazan project and currently expect on-stream in phases starting in fiscal 2019. The picture at the bottom of the slide shows the six air separation unit trains already erected at the site. And to try to bring a sense of the scale of these huge air separation units, the top picture shows just one of the cold boxes before it was shipped from China to the site. And each one of those small dots that make up the sign CG for our cogen facility is actually one of our people. In terms of safety, in September, we mark one of the most significant safety accomplishments in Air Products history when the Jazan project achieved 19 million (sic) [15 million] man hours of work without any lost time injuries. A great example from one of the very large complicated and challenging projects being executed safely by our teams around the world. We also established a world-class technology center in the Dhahran Techno Valley Science Park to serve Saudi Arabia and the Middle East region. And finally, we continue to win new projects around the world for key customers in the electronics, manufacturing and chemical markets that will drive growth for Air Products and create value for shareholders. I would like to also take a minute to highlight our clear focus on excellence in technology, engineering, manufacturing, procurement and construction, which are all essential to our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. We are very pleased that Dr. Samir Serhan joined Air Products last year, bringing deep knowledge and experience in the leadership of these critical functions. In alignment with our five-point plan, Dr. Serhan recently lead our teams through a thorough review of the strengths and opportunities in each one of the areas I mentioned above. We are now executing on clear improvements in our plant design, organizational design, work processes, footprint and talent development, while maintaining and leveraging our existing strengths. I am confident that the actions that Samir has taken will sharpen our product line focus, improve our competitiveness and subsequently enable us to deliver on our growth objectives. Now please turn to slide number 13, which summarizes the very exciting project expansion with Lu'An Clean Energy in Shanxi, China. As we announced this 15 September, we will form a $1.3 billion joint venture with Lu'An that will own and operate the air separation units, gasifiers and syngas clean-up system to provide syngas to Lu'An under a long-term agreement. This is a great example of Air Products expanding our scope of supply consistent with our business model. We continue to make good progress on the necessary approvals and are hopeful we can close on the joint venture at some point during fiscal year 2018. However, due to some uncertainty in the timing of the necessary government approvals, we have not, and I would like to stress, we have not included any contribution from Lu'An project in our EPS or CapEx guidance for fiscal year 2018. Now please turn to slide number 14, which shows you the results of our three key metrics for the quarter and year. These are the financial metrics that we use. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these three key metrics. We remain focused on driving prudent improvements as we move forward. Now please turn to a slide number 15, my favorite slide. It's great to see our margins improve again this quarter, and up slightly versus last year. It also illustrates the 900 basis point improvement versus 3.5 years ago. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2017 results before discussing our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 16. In summary for the year, higher volumes and productivity drove significant profit growth and delivered record EPS. Total sales increased 9%, with underlying sales up 7%. Volumes were broadly higher up 6%, with pricing up 1%. Unfavorable currency reduced sales by 1%, while higher energy pass-through increased sales by 3%. EBITDA of $2.8 billion increased 7%, while our EBITDA margin of 34.1% declined 80 basis points. Excluding the impact of higher energy pass-through, EBITDA margin was up 10 basis points versus prior year. Operating income of $1.8 billion increased 9%, and our operating margin of 21.6% was unchanged. Record earnings per share increased by 12% and our ROCE came in at 12.1%. Slide number 17, shows our distributable cash flow of more than $8 per share. We believe this measure more than EPS is the true measure of the value we're creating for our shareholders. Our distributable cash flow increased as a result of our strong performance in FY 2017, with EBITDA growth more than offsetting higher maintenance CapEx. Free cash flow of $450 million was modestly lower as a result of higher dividend payments, which were up 9%. Now, please turn to slide 18 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.67, or 12%, was driven primarily by higher volumes and lower cost driven by our productivity actions. Higher volumes added $0.29, as growth across our Gases segments more than offset weakness in LNG. Price of raw materials taken together was favorable $0.03 primarily from Gases Asia. And cost contributed $0.24 as our focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation. Currency was a negative $0.03 impact. Other non-operating income added $0.10 from interest income. Since this is non-operating, it is not included in our EBITDA or operating income results. All other items totaled $0.04 favorable. Now, please turn to slide 19 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. For the quarter, we also delivered record EPS. Sales of $2.2 billion, increased 13% versus last year with underlying sales up 11% on 9% higher volumes and 2% better pricing. Higher energy cost pass-through in favorable currency each added 1%. Volumes were higher across all three Gases regions and taken together, the regions had a positive impact on overall volumes of 11%. From a volume standpoint, continued progress on our Jazan project was more than offset by the continued weakness in LNG. Overall pricing improved mainly due to Gases Asia. EBITDA of $769 million improved by 13%. And operating income of $493 million improved by 16% driven by overall higher volumes, productivity as well as Asia pricing. EBITDA margin of 34.9% increased by 10 basis points and was negatively impacted by 30 basis points from higher energy cost pass-through. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margin was up 40 basis points. Operating margin of 22.4% improved by 50 basis points versus prior year. Net income increased by 19% and adjusted earnings per share increased by 18% versus prior year. ROCE of 12.1% declined by 30 basis points versus last year and 10 basis points sequentially. To provide you with some context sequentially ROCE was lower although profits were higher. This is because the denominator of the ROCE calculation has increased. The denominator is based on a five quarter average, and this now includes three quarters with a significantly higher denominator as a result of the gain from the PMD sale. Now please turn to slide 20. Looking at our Q4 cash flows we had a strong finish to fiscal 2017. Q4 distributable cash flow was over $600 million, while our free cash flow was $250 million. Free cash flow was up $100 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA. Now, please turn to slide 21. Before I discuss our underlying results, I want to spend a moment on several non-GAAP items that totaled a positive $0.39 per share. First, we made a tax selection that allowed us to recognize a tax loss on our Latin American Indura business. This resulted in a $111 million tax benefit, or $0.50 per share. To be clear, this is not reflective of a new loss or charge for this business, but rather the opportunity to recognize tax benefits from previous losses. A $12 million gain on a land sale was $0.03 per share. And finally, $48 million, or $0.14 per share of cost reduction and asset actions that include Dr. Serhan's work to restructure our engineering, manufacturing, and technology organizations. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding non-GAAP items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $1.76 increased $0.27 per share, or 18%, versus last year. Higher volumes broadly increased EPS by $0.09 per share. Pricing and raw materials, taken together, increased EPS by $0.07. China pricing strengthened again this quarter. Net cost performance was favorable $0.06, as our productivity actions and the TSA income more than offset inflation. We are pleased that we delivered on a $100 million productivity commitment this year. As a reminder, included in the cost major factor, is the other income and expense line on the consolidated P&L. As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements, or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for these services was about $10 million this quarter and is shown in the other income and expense line. We expect these TSAs to wind down in the first half of 2018 and are committed to taking actions to reduce the costs associated with providing these services. Depending on the exact timing, we may see a brief gap between the end of the revenue from the TSAs and the cost savings. For the quarter, currency and foreign exchange gains and losses net to $0.02 favorable, as we experienced a weaker dollar particularly versus the euro as the trend from earlier this year reversed. Equity affiliate income added $0.02 due to the underlying strength across a number of our joint ventures. Other non-operating income added $0.03 due to interest income. Interest expense was $0.01 favorable as our lower debt balance more than offset higher rates. Tax, non-controlling interest, and shares outstanding reached $0.01 unfavorable. Turning to slide 22, I would like to update you on our capital deployment capacity. We have about $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments as of September 30. After maintaining a modest operating cash balance, we have about $3.5 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of September 30 is about $4 billion. As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Based on a trailing 12 months EBITDA of $2.8 billion, this would support a debt level in the range of about $5.5 billion to $7 billion. So in total, between our available cash and additional debt capacity, we have about $5.5 billion we can deploy today while maintaining our A/A2 rating. As we have mentioned, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash, that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx and dividends. So, as Seifi mentioned, over the next three years, we expect to have a total of at least $8 billion available to invest. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Please turn to slide number 23. FY 2017 was a good year across our regional businesses. We grew both sales and profits in all three of them and concluded the year on a high note. In summary, I'd say in the Americas, the profit improvement was driven primarily by higher volumes and productivity. In EMEA, the team overcame currency headwinds through productivity actions. And in Asia, we had great success in both volume and pricing. We made significant productivity gains this year, while at the same time supporting merchant demand growth. For example, our investments in distribution efficiency have helped us absorb the higher distribution costs inherent in our drive to increase our retail business. We ended the year with two quarters of sequential sales and profit growth in each of the three regions, and we delivered record quarterly profits in Q4. I would like to thank our team around the world for all of their dedication and hard work in achieving exceptional safety and business results in FY 2017. Now please turn to slide 24, Gases Americas. Before discussing our results, I'd like to express a special thanks to our operating team in the Gulf Coast. As is our practice, teams of employees volunteered to ride out Hurricane Harvey in our facilities to ensure safe and reliable supply to our customers. Our plants operated extremely well, did not sustain any damage, and we only shutdown plants due to low customer demand, we were able to keep running. Reliability is an important part of our business model and we delivered. Our team did all this safely and efficiently under trying conditions. Well done. The hurricane had little to no impact on costs and only a modest impact on sales. As a result of our people's dedication and the strength of our business throughout the Americas, we are very pleased to report strong results despite the hurricane. For this quarter, sales were at $953 million dollars, an increase of 9% versus last year. Volumes were up 7% while currency and energy pass-through were both up 1%. North American volumes grew on strong hydrogen volumes, as our refinery customers continue to operate at a high-level with less plant maintenance outages, despite the destructions caused by the hurricane. We also saw positive volume across our other product lines in North America. Latin American volumes were up slightly this quarter versus prior year, moreover economic activity remains weak. The overall pricing impact was slightly positive, but rounded to flat versus last year as higher North American pricing more than offset negative Latin America pricing. EBITDA of $402 million was up 14% as higher volumes, lower planned maintenance costs and our Taking the Lead productivity programs more than offset the hurricane impact on volumes. EBITDA margin of 42.2% was up 220 basis points higher than last year, driven by higher volume and cost savings. Higher energy pass-through reduced the margin by about 60 basis points. So excluding this, the margin was up about 280 basis points. Sequentially, EBITDA was up 9% primarily driven by lower planned maintenance costs and stronger volumes. Now please turn to slide 25. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the volume growth versus prior year and prior quarter was driven primarily by our new hydrogen plant in India that was on-stream for the full quarter. As a reminder, this 100% owned facility is reported in the EMEA segment, while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in Asia equity affiliate income. Versus last year, sales of $515 million were up 24% with volumes up 18%. Currency, primarily the euro, added another 5%. While the new India plant was the strong majority of the volume growth, our LOX/LIN and cylinder volumes were both up mid-single digits with the base business contributing almost 3% to the segment volume growth. Overall, pricing was slightly positive but rounded to flat as slightly higher underlying real pricing was partially offset by customer end product mix. EBITDA of $180 million was up 17% compared to prior year, again primarily driven by the new plant in India. However, the higher merchant sales, productivity and positive currency impact also improved profitability. EBITDA margin of 35% was down 220 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the new India plant. We are very pleased with the returns of this new project in India. But since there is always a significant amount of natural gas pass-through in any hydrogen project and natural gas is particularly expensive here, it is margin dilutive. EBITDA was up 16% sequentially on higher volumes productivity and positive currency. Please turn to slide 26, Gases Asia, where our pricing and sales momentum continued. Sales of $552 million were up 23%, compared to prior year driven by strong volume and increased prices. Volumes were up 17% roughly split 60:40 between new plants, primarily Yitai, and our base business. Merchant volumes were up across all product lines and the LOX/LIN retail to wholesale ratio continued to improve. Sequentially reported volumes were down due to the equipment sale last quarter. We raised prices significantly in the merchant market in China which drove the overall 6% increase for the region. Our team worked hard to raise prices across all liquid businesses and was particularly successful in the spot and wholesale markets. We believe China's government's focus on consolidating the steel industry and its corresponding impact on captive air separation plants, has improved the supply-demand balance. That said, we are closely monitoring this market as spot and wholesale pricing can be volatile. EBITDA of $224 million, was up 31% compared to prior year, driven by the strong volumes and higher pricing. EBITDA margin of 40.6% was up 240 basis points. Finally, please turn to slide 27 for a brief comment on our Global Gasses segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales were up $14 million, while profits were down $10 million versus prior year. We continue to make good progress on the Jazan project. But as you may remember, we recorded a large profit in Q4 of FY 2016 making for a tough comparison for this quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Simon for a comment on our Corporate segment.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 28. Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our Helium container business and our corporate costs. For the year, segment sales were down about $150 million and EBITDA was down about $90 million, primarily driven by significantly lower LNG project activity. For the quarter, in addition to the weaker LNG business, we also had a negative impact from Helium inventory revaluation. For FY 2018, although we still not yet seen LNG customers moving forward with their investment decisions, we don't anticipate an earnings headwind for the Corporate segment. Now I'm pleased to turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about Air Products' future. As I discussed earlier, we are very proud of having delivered on our promises from three years ago. And we are excited about the opportunity to build on our success. Our safety, productivity and operating performance continues to be strong. In fiscal year 2018 and beyond, we will continue to focus on productivity, which remains an important factor in delivering our earnings per share growth commitment. As you will recall, three years ago we had stated that we will deliver $600 million of productivity improvement. Up to now we have delivered more than $475 million and we will deliver the balance in the next two years or three years. As you know, our portfolio actions and strong cash flow generation of our company provides us with an expected capacity of over $8 billion to invest over the next three years. I am confident that Air Products will be successful in utilizing our balance sheet to invest in our core Industrial Gases business to create significant value for our shareholders. Let me review the investment opportunities we see for the growth that I'm talking about. First, acquisition of small and medium-sized industry or gas companies or assets from businesses from our industrial gas competitors. The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee. This is what we call asset buybacks and we see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category. We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units and sale of syngas to customers under long-term agreements. Essentially these opportunities are as the same as the traditional onsite business model that we have, something that we do every day, but with existing rather than new production assets. The Lu'An project that we described before is a perfect example of this area of possible growth for us. We expect to do more of these. And the third area of opportunity is the very large industrial gas projects around the world, driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy and emerging market growth. The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these projects can be. The plant we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of industrial gas industry with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects that I'm talking about could also include gasification and syngas supply. We are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident the risk return profile will create significant value for our shareholders. Now please turn to slide number 29. Our great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented and motivated employees remain focused on being the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Continuing our positive momentum, we expect to deliver earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.05 per share for fiscal year 2018, up 9% to 12% from our very strong fiscal year 2017 performance. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment to grow earnings per share by at least 10% each year in the future. For quarter one of fiscal year 2018, our earnings per share guidance is $1.60 to $1.70, up 9% to 16% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We expect our capital expenditure to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2018. As I mentioned before, our EPS and CapEx guidance do not include any contribution from the Lu'An project or any other M&A opportunities that we might execute during the year. We are certainly working on other opportunities that could potentially add to our results in fiscal year 2018, but have not included any other significant acquisition in our guidance. Let me summarize on the slide number 30. I'm proud of the performance that our great team delivered in the last few years. I'm very excited about the potential for Air Products in 2018 and beyond to deliver real growth in our sales and profitability. Please turn to slide number 31. In addition to being the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, we are now elevating our commitment to diversity and inclusion by explicitly incorporating it in our goal. This a natural extension of the culture that we're building at Air Products. I believe this focus on diversity and inclusion will actually contribute to maintaining our position as the most profitable industrial gas company over the long-term. Because, as I've always said, the degree of commitment and motivation of our people is the real sustainable competitive advantage that we have. We want to ensure that we are providing opportunities and the right environment for everyone to contribute and succeed regardless of their gender, color, race, religion, orientation, country of origin or any other dimension of diversity. At this point, we will be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just on the merchant pricing in China, obviously nice acceleration from 4% last quarter to 6% this quarter. Where do you think we are in terms of utilization rates there, feels like there's been a very significant uptick in the past few quarters. Do you think we're in the mid 80%s? I felt like you were being a little bit conservative maybe on the outlook, just talking about how it can lump around. But what are you seeing, and what do you think the bull and bear cases on this line item are going forward?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: First of all, good morning, Vincent. I'm going to ask Corning to answer the specifics, but I'd just like to say that you have to make a distinction between utilization of the overall industrial gas companies in China and our utilization rate. So, Corning is going to address our utilization rate. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So our utilization rates are in the low 80%s. I think, you're fishing for what we think the larger market might be. But I think, with the dynamic situation in the steel industry, it's difficult to make a precise estimate of where we think overall industry loading is at. Clearly though, the supply-demand dynamic is better than it has been.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up. In the Americas, year-over-year there was an issue with lower maintenance expense. But then obviously also the volume came back nicely and I would assume that had an incremental positive impact. So, can you just help us bridge last year to this year and what was the gross positive benefit from the maintenance, or would you say the volume was maybe better anyway regardless of the difference in maintenance year-over-year?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So I would say the volume was a positive for us if we look across the business. Maintenance was a mild positive for us if we look at the fourth quarter. If we look at the full year, relatively flat.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, Vincent, I'd just like to add that one of the main drivers for our volume growth grow is our hydrogen business.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. You hit a little on this during your prepared remarks, but can you just kind of give us a little more detail on the update on the Lu'An, just the regulatory process, I guess this is the original four to six months. I guess this the reasoning for excluding it from your fiscal year 2018 guidance. And then more importantly probably as well as the Chinese opportunity that may await once you receive the regulatory approval? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Chris. Chris, with respect to Lu'An, the approval that we need is that Lu'An is a state-owned company. Whatever they need to do has to be approved by SESAK, which is the overall controller of all of the assets for all of the state-owned companies in China. That process does take time, it is difficult to make an assessment. We quite honestly had a lot of debate about what to do about this thing and we thought that the best thing is to say that, let's not exclude it in our estimate and then when the time comes and we get approval we will obviously add it. But I'd just like to say that Lu'An on a full-year operating basis, if it was operating for the full year, it will contribute to our bottom-line about $0.25, $0.26. So now, during fiscal year 2017 (sic) [fiscal year 2018] whenever it comes up we will inform you. We expect this process to take about five months or six months, it's just like a little bit like anti-trust approval. But we don't know for sure. But as soon as that happens, and we close, we will let the investment community know, and we will adjust our guidance accordingly.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: With respect to other projects in China, obviously we are working on other projects in China and when and if they happen, we will obviously make an announcement.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And you hit a little on the merchant pricing, but overall just results across it seems China and India continue to do well. Can you just walk us through rough expectations for Asia? If you have any additional comments by country and I even think of a project or two in South Korea as well. So any additional comments there would be helpful. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, you know we've been saying this for quite a while, Chris, that we are very positive about growth opportunities in China. India is growing very fast; you don't see the results because we don't consolidate the numbers. We are making very good progress in Korea. We are executing a lot of – so we feel very positive about that region. Corning would you like to add anything?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So let me just say, I think in China, it's across many different industry groups where we're seeing success, and you see that in merchant which really cuts across most manufacturing fields out there. In a country like Korea, the overall economy, I would say, is not quite as dynamic as the Chinese, but the electronics one is very strong, and we're well positioned to succeed there and have an active project in Pyeongtaek and are already building the second plant for that. So I think that's where we see the growth in a country like that.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Don. How are you doing?
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Very good, thank you. Question on the underlying business, you've had a pickup in volume growth. I think you were 6% for the year, but you were 9% for the quarter. If you strip out some of the new projects like India, it would appear that you're seeing some accelerating momentum in your base business in merchant and cylinder gas globally. Is that the case and how do you feel about that momentum as 2018 unfolds?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I think that is the case quite honestly, when you look at what our competitors have announced, you get a sense for that. So overall, we are seeing positive signs for the overall industrial gas industry. And based on what we see right now, we are obviously positive for 2018, but anything can happen. But in general, there is a positive environment for all of us. Corning, you want to add?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Maybe just to clarify for that. In our base number, you know, India is in our equity affiliate. So the biggest driver you're seeing in there is really in the other areas. And if I was going to look in a region like Europe, the base business up 3%. and that's both package gases, which has been on a rebound for us for over a year. But the liquid bulk is a more positive trend for us. So I'd say mildly improving conditions, and that we're seeing that across many of the industries that we serve.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And Corning, how about in North America as opposed to Latin America, are you seeing an improvement in merchant business as well?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Don, to be clear, most of the improvement we saw was really in the HyCO space for us. I'd say we clearly had positive LOX/LIN volume growth for the quarter, but it was modest.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: The growth in the U.S. is very modest.
Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. There were $48 million in restructuring charges. Are those cash charges, or non-cash or what's the split? And in the funds flow statement there was $165 million annual benefit from other adjustments. Is that something that we'll repeat next year or it won't?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I think, the best person to answer this, is Scott. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. Hi, Jeff. This is Scott. So, in terms of the costs for the restructuring, yeah, there'll be cash costs that we'll see. We saw a little bit in this quarter, but most of it that will be seen early part of next year. So yes, there will be a cash cost that's in there. And the other thing in terms of the cash flow statement and a comment on the other tax election. So as I've mentioned, we took a restructuring over South America business that allowed us to recognize a loss that partially offset the gain for Evonik. So, we also saw a benefit, that could be $111 million of benefit to the cash flow statement, about a third of that came for forward in the fourth quarter and the other two-thirds will be in the second quarter, is when we expect to see that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then was the contribution from Jazan in the fourth quarter similar to what it was in the third quarter or different? And did you notice that Praxair signed a deal with BASF in the syngas area in Louisiana. And do you think that that shows that the syngas area is now sort of identified by the industrial gas industry generally and will become more competitive over time?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, with respect to the Jazan thing, I think there wasn't much of a difference between the third quarter and fourth quarter. And then with respect to the syngas, they did announce that they are doing something with BASF on syngas though quite honestly, a month ago, we did – about a month and a half ago, we are building bigger project for Huntsman in the same area. It's a very large HyCO unit providing CO to their MDI unit. So, I think, the idea of providing – they've been providing basically syngas to most of these companies when they build SMRs. The part that we are getting into is when that syngas is being converted to other materials like liquids or diesel fuel and so on, we are getting involved in that part and I'll leave it for the other company to come and if they are getting into that or not.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Duffy Fisher with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, fellas.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Duffy. How are you?
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good. Just question again on Jazan, to follow-on there a little bit. That has been sequentially somewhat lumpier times since we've undertaken it. Can you give us any guidance as we go through this year, should we expect meaningful lumpiness and can you help us with which quarters might be up or down significantly if that's the case?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I don't expect any lumpiness because quite honestly that project is going very smoothly. The reason that it was lumpy last year in 2016 was because we were not taking any profit for a while, just making sure that the project is real and is on-stream. But during the course of 2017, it has been very kind of not very lumpy and we don't expect that to be – we expect that to be smooth for the balance of 2018.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just on Lu'An, you talked about kind of that $0.25 of profitability the first year, should we think about that as a baseline that would then grow roughly in line with what Air Products does kind of 10%-plus, or is there some natural synergies there that would mean year two and year three should see meaningfully faster growth than what the base company would see?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: The agreement that we have on Lu'An is like our other onsite agreements. It is a fixed BFC. So, the profitability of that business is going to be approximately $0.25, $0.26 on an annual basis, and it will be the same in the future except for some adjustments for inflation. So, that's – it's not a business that is going to grow beyond adjustments that we have agreed with other side for inflation. So that is the good thing because it's not going to go down, it's going to be consistent and it's fixed fee that we charge to Lu'An for providing syngas. Thank you.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Terrific, thank you guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning P.J.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Seifi, your backlog of $1.5 billion was – it's quite strong in Asia, but has only two projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. So when the industry adds investment on the Gulf Coast, do you expect to see more projects down the road in your backlog?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes if there are projects done in the Gulf Coast, when they would happen, we expect to get our fair share of the market. Yes. But there are not that many projects being executed in the Gulf Coast.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And the long-term question for you, Seifi. You know a lot about lithium and electric cars, given your background from Rockwood. Do you think that electrification of automobiles will be negative for hydrogen assets for the industry? And you could end up with some stranded assets down the road? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No, not at all, I actually the way I see that P.J. is that I think that the industry, I'm not an expert, but I tell you my view. I think the industry is going to shift to electric for sure. But then people are going to find out that now they have to generate the electricity. And certain countries like China, they have a lot of coal that they can burn, it's called clean coal gasification, which is great for us, to use the coal and create clean electricity. But there are countries like Japan, how do you generate electricity in Japan? That is why in Japan, and you look at Toyota, they are not working on electric cars, they are working on hydrogen cars, because they don't have coal to generate electricity and they don't want to do nuclear. I see the transition over time by internal combustion engine, electric cars and eventually hydrogen. So we are very bullish on that and we are, as you know, the leader in this field. And this is a long-term thing, it will happen 15, 20 years from now. But right now we are very active in this area and we see actually a very great future for hydrogen cars, which would be a better solution in the long-term than electric cars.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And are you actively investing in hydrogen cars or creating hydrogen assets for hydrogen powered cars?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We are actually investing, yes, quite a bit in – not in the production of the hydrogen cars, but in production of fueling station and creating fueling stations, so that when you have your hydrogen car, you can go like a gas station and fill your car with hydrogen. We have some of those operational. If you are in Los Angeles, we can show you those where it says Air Products and you can actually drive there and fill up your car with hydrogen. We are working on hundreds of these, we are working on those in the United States, in California. We have a joint venture now, with Shinwa in China to do this. We are working on this thing in Japan. We are working on this thing in Europe. Yes, we are active. I think of all of the industrial gas companies, we are the most active in this area.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning. You know Seifi, over the past year in particular we've seen a lot of environmental-related supply constraints across various industries in China. If I look at your volume numbers in Asia they're up 17% I think you indicated two-thirds of that was new plants, so maybe you know mid-single digits baseline growth. And so my question is are you seeing or not seeing any impact from some of those supply constraints broadly in China? Or put differently, would your volume numbers in Asia be even better were that not the case?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes, the environmental constraints in China are very beneficial to us, because one of the effects of the environmental constraints is the shutting down of a lot of inefficient steel industry, which is basically elimination of our competitors because those are small steel companies. Each had an air suppression unit and there was a competitor. So from that point of view it's positive. The second thing is that China is moving in a big way towards clean coal technology and that is why you see all of these gasification projects. That is why we are focused on them. So overall, we are benefiting from the constraints that they are putting there. That is why, when we talk about growth in the future. You always see that we talk about energy, about environment and about emerging markets. So, that is a very positive trend for us. And fortunately, we are in a leading position of us coal gasification and we will see a lot of benefits and a lot of big projects in the future.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Thank you for that. And then, second question on EMEA. A volume of 18% there, what would that number have been, were it not for the new plant in India. How would you characterize the baseline growth regionally in EMEA?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: That would have been 3%.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Just a quick one, I'm wondering if there are any rays of hope out there on the LNG side? I think you said it's not going to get worse, but I guess we've seen oils rally 25% or 30% here in the last three or four months. Is that something that might start some increased activity?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Bob. Bob, I said our LNG base basically is right now, is not making any money. We have restructured the business in such a way that we wouldn't lose anything. So we are at the bottom. Anything that happens will be on the upside. Depending on whom you talk to the industry and I'm sure you are very much – very knowledgeable on this thing, different people take different views. We are prepared to live with – we have said that 2018, we don't expect any improvement, but in 2019, 2020, I think it will come back because no matter how you look at it, the world expect – the world is going to need LNG. So, it's just a matter of riding through the cycle. But fortunately, for us the worst is over.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And Seifi, you characterized that China changed behavior towards some of these end markets or production assets helping you. Is there also some scope that, as we've seen in some industries, these will only be temporary adjustments, or do you think there is actually some permanent closure over there that's giving way to some sustainability in these trend?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We are very optimistic that these are permanent thing, but Corning, you want to make some comments?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. I think that the underlying megatrend in China and their approach to steel and all of that is going to continue. I do think it could be a little bit bouncy between now and then and especially, let's say, in some of the wholesale business areas. Of course, we're moving more towards retail. But I think the underlying mega-trend is going to be sustained for some time.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: It's going to be good for us.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, David. How are you these days?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, thank you. Seifi, just on your 2018 guidance, I believe that you're looking for a $0.65 EPS increase at the midpoint. Do you have an earnings bridge to get from 2017 to 2018 for the $0.65?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: David, the Air Products used to do that, I told them to stop that, because we don't want to give too much information to our competitors. But basically, what is that $0.65, that $0.65 consists of productivity that we will continue to deliver. It will consist of new plants coming on-stream, which is not a lot if you exclude Lu'An. And then it will come from what we believe will be some modest growth in volumes and some modest growth in pricing. And then you add all of that up and come up with the $0.63. We obviously feel very confident that they can deliver that; otherwise we wouldn't put it in our guidance. But those are the key elements, but we don't break it down anymore as we used to do.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very clear, and just on capital deployment Seifi, you know it's a – you know, you can't discuss it all happens. But is it more likely to be second half – first half and second half or vice versa in terms of when the next project or two might be announced for that $1 billion-plus of deployments?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, what do you want me to say David?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: First, I'd like to say first half.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We're trying. Okay, thanks.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning. You had this price increase announcement about a month ago when your North American merchant business in the 10% to 20% range. Can you just comment on what's the average term of your North American merchant contracts, and therefore the percentage that might be up for renewal in any given year? And do you see this market tight enough for that to flow through upon contract renewal, or the risk of losing some of these accounts?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Corning will answer that. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, so let me speak about the term and then be a little more coy on the pricing just because I think of the competitive situation there. So, the term typically is five years, so you can think of about 20% of it coming up in any given year. Different contracts have different clauses in it, some get rolled before the five-year-period is up and so forth. So I would just say we work pricing hard, and that announcement is part of our overall pricing program, but I'd really not like to go into specifics around that.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then one for you Seifi. One of your long-term plans was just a culture change at Air Products. How would you assess where you are at now? Do you see more to go there or has there been a sufficient amount of change in the overall company organization?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, on that front, I'm obviously pleased with the improvements that we have made, but I think there is more room to go. As I always tell our people, I'm happy where we are, but I'm never going to be satisfied. Whatever we are we can do even better than that. I think the people have responded very well. I'm very proud of the team. I always say that I'm very, quite honestly, very proud and honored to be part of this team. But there is still room to go. We have 15,000 people in this company and to claim that we have reached every one of them with the new culture would be an exaggeration. So, we do have more work to do, but we have made a lot of progress and I think the best example of that is our safety record because that we need the participation of all of the 15,000 people. And obviously, our financial performance. And it's not easy to improve the EBITDA margin of a company like Air Products, the size of Air Products, by 900 basis points in three years unless you had the full cooperation and support of all of the people. So I thank them for that. But as I said, there's always more room to go.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, John.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: As the Jazan equipment sales ramped down, and with LNG at a low level, does it make sense to roll the global segment at some point into the regional segments and maybe take out some more overhead?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No, the global thing is just what we report. It's not a different sector that somebody is running with their staff or anything, John. That's just how we report it to you, because I did not want to allocate corporate overhead to the regions. So that, it stands out and you can take a look at it and we can challenge it every day. But it's not an organization that if we kind of roll it into other things we would save any money.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, I withdraw the question then. Any opportunities for Air Products to own 100% of Jazan? I mean, it seems like Saudi Arabia is more in a monetization mode as a country and obviously Air Products is in an investment mode here. Is that a possibility or you don't see that down the road?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the thing is that if the 75% of Jazan that we don't own was owned by the Government of Saudi Arabia. I think we might have an argument on that. But the 75% that we do not own is owned by a private company, ACWA Energy, and they like Jazan as much as we do. So, unless we are willing to go and offer them a very high price, I think they like where they are. And certainly that company is a very strong company, and they are not suffering from cash. So, I think the possibility is very low, John.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. With respect to your cash flow focus and distributable cash flow for the outlook for 2018, where do you expect your maintenance CapEx level to be relative to $377 million in fiscal 2017.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I think we are in solid ground to say that it would be around $400 million. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, I agree.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Roughly flat to this year.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: About $400 million.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Jim.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Hey, Mike, how are you these days?
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Doing well. Thank you. Corning, can you quantify what was the hydrogen growth in the Americas and maybe give a little bit more color on the impact that the hurricane had. Was it all just lost volume or did you end up getting some unusual spot sales because competitors may have been out or people needed hydrogen in unusual places?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Mike, this is Seifi. I am certain that Corning can quantify exactly what the growth in hydrogen was, but he is not going to do that, because we don't want to give that information away. I'm sure you understand that, Mike, right?
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Understood. And then I was wondering if you could comment on the progress that you're making in replacing the merchant revenue that was related to Airgas, just kind of update on what kind of impact you expect from the loss of that business and the timing of when it hits you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: That was a contract where we were not making a lot of money on it. So I'm not sure there was a huge loss on that. But, Corning, you want to – I don't think we're going to quantify anything for you, but Corning do you want to make any general comment?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So, we're working hard to replace that volume and we've had modest volume growth, as I talked about earlier, in terms of LOX, LIN and LAR and so we continue to work that. You'll see a full quarter impact of that next quarter.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And we have taken that into consideration...
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Absolutely.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: ...obviously when we gave you our guidance.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Hi, there, two quick ones. Can you characterize bidding activity and in particular whether the Lu'An JV returns are comparable to what you're seeing on new bids or if they're above average? And secondly, with reference to your discussion about hydrogen cars, are you seeing any shift, particularly in Europe, about carbon taxes and therefore renewed interest in your technology around Carbon Capture?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: With respect to Lu'An, I mean, we have told you that the Lu'An returns are – we don't take any projects less than 10%, so Lu'An is higher than that. With respect to Carbon Capture in Europe, we are seeing some legislation, but I think Corning is very informed on this thing; he can give you an answer. Go ahead.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Let me just say, just a few weeks ago I was in Europe talking with a major customer about a Carbon Capture project. I think the conditions are always going to require government support and that's not fully in place, but the opportunities enough there that we're in direct conversations with people about it.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. With that, I would like to thank everybody for being on our call today. Thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest. And we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the very best.
Operator: And that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals' Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' third quarter 2017 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and in today's earnings release. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that due to the hard work and commitment of our people at Air Products, we delivered another quarter of very strong performance, with EPS growth of 15% over last year. This is the 13th consecutive quarter that we have reported year-over-year EPS growth. We also delivered excellent safety results and generated over $500 million of distributable cash flow this quarter. Our volumes are up 8%, the highest in more than two years, and we continue to win and execute successfully on major industrial gas projects for customers around the world. Now please turn to a slide number 3, where I would like to take a few minutes to remind everyone of the progress we have made. Specifically, I want to talk about the promises we made three years ago and the results we have delivered. In 2014, we made several commitments to ourselves and to our shareholders. And as I recall, there may have been skepticism in the investment community at the time about our ability to deliver. So let us update you on where we are today. Three years ago, we said that Air Products will be the safest industrial gas company in the world, we will be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, we will divest our non-core assets, we will have the best balance sheet in the industry and we will deliver 10% per year EPS growth every year. I am proud of our team for delivering on every one of these promises. On slide number 4, you can see the results of the first two commitments. We are today the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have delivered significant improvement in our employee lost-time injury rate and we have an EBITDA margin of 34%, which is up 900 basis points versus three years ago. On slide number 5, you can see our success in divesting non-core assets. We sold our chemical business to Evonik for almost 16 times EBITDA, and I'm confident this business and the people involved will thrive in Evonik. We spun off our Electronic Materials business as an independent company called Versum Materials. The Versum team is 100% focused on the electronic market as a leading material supplier. They have delivered strong results and the Versum stock is currently trading at over 13 times EBITDA, in fact, a higher multiple than Air Products right now. And as you saw this morning, the great management team there delivered very strong results also. Slide number 6 shows the results of our improved business performance and the successful transaction. Air Products has the strongest balance sheet in the industry. So we are well positioned to take advantage of the tremendous growth opportunities in industrial gases. That is our future and, as you can see, we had delivered EPS growth of 10% in 2015, 16% in fiscal year 2016, and at the mid-point of our 2017 guidance, we will be up another 10%. To summarize on slide 7, the hardworking and committed team at Air Products has delivered on what we promised. And what is most exciting to me right now is that we are very well positioned to grow Air Products and create significant further value for our shareholders. We now have the balance sheet to do it. Let me review the investment opportunities we see for this growth that I'm talking about. First, acquisitions of small size and medium size industrial gas companies, or assets or businesses from other industrial gas companies. Second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customers based on a fixed fee. We see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category. We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units and sale of syngas to customers under long-term agreement. Essentially, these opportunities are the same as the traditional onsite business model that we have, something that we do every day, but with existing rather than new production assets. And the third area of opportunity is the very large industrial gas projects around the world driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy and emerging markets. The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these projects can be. The plant we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of industrial gas industry, with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects that I'm talking about could also include gasification and syngas supply and could be as big or even bigger than Jazan. Scott will take you through the details, but like last quarter, the estimate that we will have at least $8 billion of capacity to invest over the next three years. And I truly believe that Air Products will be successful in utilizing our balance sheet to invest in our core Industrial Gases business to create significant shareholder value. But as I have always said, if we can't find good enough good projects, we will stay disciplined and return the cash to our shareholders; after all, it is your money. And I know everybody continues to be interested in a timeline for deploying the cash. But as I have said, we are not in a hurry and we will take our time to make sure that we are investing in value-generating projects. Now please turn to slide number 8, where you can see examples of the success that Air Products has had with major projects around the world. Just in the past quarter, we announced new Electronis wins in China, a new HyCO facility in Louisiana and a new air separation unit in New York. These new wins will drive growth for Air Products and create value for our shareholders. As importantly, our teams are executing well on our projects in the backlog. We successfully brought onstream a major hydrogen plant in India and another major oxygen plant in China. Now, please turn to the slide number 9, that shows another quarter of very strong safety performance. These results do not happen without everyone of our team around the world being focused on safety every single day. I also believe these results also reflect an empowered and focused culture that also creates good financial results. Slide number 10 is our goal for the company. As I explained at the beginning of this call, we have made great progress and are determined to continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Now, please turn to the slide number 11, our overall management philosophy that we have talked to you many times. We continue to be focused on shareholder value, cash generation, capital allocation, and empowered and decentralized organization. And slide number 12, that you have seen many times before, is our Five-Point Plan which is the roadmap for our success. Slide number 13 shows you the results of our three key metrics. We remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these three metrics. And today, we are the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each one of these metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward. Now please go to my favorite slide, slide number 14. It's obviously great to see that the margins improved versus last quarter. Also as you know, when natural gas prices are higher, we report higher sales with no profit, since the costs are passed through to our customers. Excluding this impact on natural gas, actually EBITDA margins were 30 basis points higher versus last year. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be more than happy to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to slide 15 for a more detailed review of our Q3 results. Sales of $2.1 billion increased 11% versus last year on 8% higher volumes. This was our best volume performance in at least two years. Higher energy cost pass-through added 5%, while the currency impact was 2% unfavorable. Volumes were higher across all the three regions, and taken together, the regions increased overall volumes by 8%. In our sale of equipment businesses, continued progress on our Jazan project was largely offset by the continued weakness in LNG. Overall, pricing remains unchanged, with increases in Asia being offset by weakness in Europe. EBITDA of $722 million improved by 7%, and operating income of $463 million improved by 11%. EBITDA margin of 34% decreased by 120 basis points and was negatively impacted by 150 basis points from higher energy cost pass-though. Excluding this impact, EBITDA margin was up 30 basis points. Operating margin of 21.8% was unchanged versus prior year as unfavorable energy pass-through of 90 basis points was offset by favorable volumes. Sequential margins improved by more than 100 basis points driven by higher volumes. Versus prior year, net income increased by 16%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 15%. ROCE of 12.2% improved by 10 basis points versus last year and was down 10 basis sequentially. To provide you with some context, sequentially, ROCE is down slightly while profits are up because the denominator of the ROCE calculation has increased. The denominator is based on a five-quarter average and this now includes two quarters that contain a significantly higher denominator as a result of the PMD gain. Now, please turn to slide 16. As you know, Air Products continues to be very focused on cash flow. Our distributable cash flow was over $500 million this quarter, while our free cash flow was $139 million. Free cash flow was up $47 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA. Year-to-date distributable cash flow is $1.3 billion, while our free cash flow is approximately $200 million. Please turn to slide 17. Before I discuss our underlying results, I want to spend a moment on non-GAAP items. In continuing operations, we had non-GAAP charges that totaled $1.18 per share. In Latin America, during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017 volumes declined and overall revenue growth was below our previous forecast due to weak Latin American economic conditions and a lack of recovery in mining-related demand. Our current outlook is now below the previous forecast used to establish the carrying value of the business. As a result, our goodwill review resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $162 million or $0.70 per share. We also completed a review of the business plan and resulting outlook associated with Abdullah Hashim Industrial Gases, or AHG, a 25%-owned equity affiliate. We determined there was a decline in the value and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $80 million, or $0.36 per share, that reduces the carrying value of our investment. The decline in value results from expectations for lower future cash flows to be generated by AHG, primarily due to weaker economic conditions in Saudi Arabia. The team is working hard to implement a profit improvement plan. Let me add that while no one can predict the future, at this time, we do not believe we will have similar impacts resulting from other acquisitions we have made in the past. And with our focus on capital allocation, we are highly confident that future M&A transactions will create value for our shareholders. Finally, cost reduction and asset actions continue through the year as we take further actions as part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and to offset stranded costs from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. The charge of $43 million, or $0.14 per share, includes the planned sale of a Latin American hardgoods business and closure of an LNG heat exchanger manufacturing facility. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Turning to slide 18, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Excluding non-GAAP items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.65 increased $0.21 per share, or 15%, versus last year. Higher volumes broadly increased EPS by $0.19 per share. Pricing and power costs, taken together, decreased EPS by $0.01. This was driven in part by higher power cost in our Europe business. On a positive note, we saw significant pricing improvement this quarter in China. Net cost performance was unfavorable $0.02, as our productivity actions and the TSA income were more than offset by other costs including maintenance and inflation. We remain committed to delivering our $100 million of cost savings this year. As a reminder, included in the cost major factor is the other income (expense) line on our consolidated P&L. As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements, or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for these services was about $10 million this quarter and is shown in the other income (expense) line. We expect these TSAs to wind down in 2018 and are committed to taking actions to reduce the resulting stranded costs. For the quarter, currency and foreign exchange gains and losses net to $0.01 unfavorable. We added a new line to our income statement last quarter called other non-operating income (expense). This is where we are reporting the interest income from our more than $3 billion of cash and short-term investments. The interest income was about $0.03 this quarter. Since this is non-operating, it is not included in our EBITDA or operating income results. Interest expense was $0.02 lower due to our lower debt balance partially offset by higher rates. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 24%, about 1% lower than last year. We still expect our FY 2017 tax rate to be approximately 23%. Turning to slide 19, I would like to update you on our capital deployment capacity. We have about $3.3 billion of cash in short-term investments as of June 30. After we pay the remaining taxes due on the PMD gain and maintain a modest operating cash balance, we have about $2.9 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of June 30 is about $3.9 billion. As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA of $2.7 billion, this would support a debt level in the range of about $5.5 billion to $7 billion. So in total, between available cash and additional debt capacity, we have about $5 billion we can deploy today, while maintaining our A/A2 rating. As we have mentioned, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash, that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx and dividends. So as Seifi mentioned, over the next three years, we expect to have a total of at least $8 billion available to invest. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call cover to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. This was our best quarter for both safety and volumes, since we began reporting on a regional basis in FY 2015. Our teams had worked hard to safely bring onstream large new projects and win merchant customers around the world. While this performance is very good, we have more work to do on productivity. We generated significant savings from our Taking the Lead productivity actions, but these were impacted by a number of offsetting cost items. The good news is that we continue to see productivity opportunities. I would like to again thank our people around the world for staying focused on our goals, especially safety, excellent customer service and our Taking the Lead productivity projects. As an example of Taking the Lead, improving compressor efficiency is an opportunity for us. Compressors consume most of the power at an air separation plant, we have many of them and we have many plants. So you can't have an engineer sitting next to every compressor. So we continue to develop remote diagnostic tools to identify opportunities and take actions across our global fleet of compressors. These actions drive both productivity and enhance reliability. Before I discuss the regions, I'm going to address helium. Industrial gases is primarily a local business, but helium has a global supply chain. The recent events in Qatar disrupted that global supply chain. Clearly, this is not over yet and the situation remains volatile, but we are confident that we can take good care of our customers through this. Air Products has a geographically diversified supply base. Our wholesale commitments take a big step down at the end of this month and we have a new tranche of helium supply coming on in January. Beyond that, we bought over 75% of the helium at offer at the BLM auction two weeks ago. So we are confident that we can continue to provide excellent service to our customers, whatever happens in the Gulf region. Now please turn to slide 20 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Volumes were up 3%, the best volume performance in over two years. The pass-through of higher energy prices, with the Houston Ship Channel natural gas prices up almost 70%, significantly diluted our margins again this quarter. Sales of $930 million were up 12% versus last year, with volumes up 3% and higher energy cost pass-through up 9%. North American volumes were up on modest merchant growth across most of our product lines and strong hydrogen volumes as our refinery customers continue to operate at a high level. Hydrogen volumes were also stronger sequentially, following customer planned outages in Q2. Latin American volumes were up slightly this quarter versus prior year, led by the liquid bulk business. However, economic activity remains weak. Results improved sequentially as expected on seasonality. EBITDA of $367 million was up 1% as the contribution from higher volumes and our Taking the Lead cost reduction programs were partially offset by planned maintenance-related costs. EBITDA margin of 39.5% was down 400 basis points, with higher energy cost pass-through accounting for about 330 basis points. Excluding this impact, the margin was down about 70 basis points. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be shedding about $70 million in annual wholesale volumes in North America, beginning next month with the end of our supply contract for liquid bulk products to Airgas. I am encouraged to see our sales efforts paying off and volumes building as we are working hard to replace this volume with retail sales. We had two significant project announcements since our last earnings call. First in June, we announced Air Products will retire our 1970s-era plant and build a new highly efficient air separation unit in Glenmont, New York, providing additional liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon to the merchant market. Ours is a long-term business and this is an example of investing for the future. And just recently, we announced the award of a carbon monoxide and hydrogen supply contract from Huntsman to supply their world scale MDI facility in Geismar, Louisiana. We will be building a new steam methane reformer to supply Huntsman and connecting it to our 600-mile hydrogen pipeline system. Now, please turn to slide 21. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the volume growth was driven primarily by our new hydrogen plant in India. Versus last year, sales of $452 million were up 5%, with volumes up 6%, price down 1%, higher energy cost pass-through up 4%, and currency down 4%. The currency impact was primarily the British pound, and other than the continued currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit discussions have had much impact on our business this quarter. Our new hydrogen and ASU project for BPCL in India was fully onstream as of the end of Q3. As a reminder, this one 100% Air Products-owned facility will be reported in the EMEA segment, while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in the Asia equity affiliate income. Excluding the impact of our new hydrogen plant, our underlying volumes were positive on strength in tonnage and packaged gases. These gains were partially offset by lower equipment sales and a project close-out. Reported price was down 1%, as a mix effect, both in terms of customer mix and product mix, offset slightly higher underlying real pricing. So, when we say price, we mean exclusively merchant pricing. And when we say real price, I mean the same gas sold to the same customer. Although underlying real price is positive, we were not able to recover as much of the higher power costs as we had hoped to in this quarter. And I can assure you, our team continues to be very focused on pricing. EBITDA of $155 million was down 3%, but that would have been slightly up on a constant currency basis. Positive cost performance and higher equity affiliate income were offset by equipment and the negative mix and cost impacts. EBITDA margin of 34.3% was down 310 basis points, with a higher energy pass-through accounting for about 140 basis points. Excluding this impact, the margin was down 170 basis points about evenly impacted by equipment and mix costs. Please turn to slide 22, Gases Asia, where we showed very strong volume and profit growth. Sales of $538 million were up 20%, driven by volume growth of the same amount. About half of the volume growth was due to equipment sale projects, which we would not expect to reoccur in Q4. The remaining 10% of the growth was approximately evenly split between new project onstreams and base business growth. Our ongoing drive for retail sales and pricing, aided by the consolidation of the steel industry, is paying off. The Asia merchant gas business continues to improve in terms of both measures, retail sales and pricing. For example, LOX/LIN volumes were up high single-digits and the retail business was up low double-digits. And in China, this was even more dramatic, with mid-teen retail growth, that was about 2x our total LOX/LIN growth rate. At the same time, LOX/LIN prices were up nearly 4%. Our gains in argon were even more dramatic, with total volume, retail volume and pricing, all three up double-digits. We need to keep in mind that there is still significant overcapacity in China and a recovery in this market may be bumpy, but our efforts clearly delivered. EBITDA of $211 million was up 15%, with strong contributions from higher volumes, including the equipment sales and on higher pricing. We had Taking the Lead cost savings, but this was somewhat offset by a positive cost reimbursement in Q3 last year. We expect to receive this in Q4 this year. Equity affiliate income was down due to a one-time benefit last year. This impacts EBTIDA, but not operating income. EBITDA margin of 39.2% was down 160 basis points on the items just referenced. We continue to win and successfully execute projects throughout Asia. In the electronics area, we were pleased to be awarded the industrial gas supply for Fujian Jinhua's new memory fab in Fujian Province and SMIC's foundry capacity expansion in Tianjin. And we successfully brought on another very large air separation complex to supply oxygen, nitrogen, and air to Yitai Chemical's fine chemical coal gasification project in Inner Mongolia. These plants have a combined capacity of over 9,000 tons a day, and join our other successful oxygen for coal gasification projects in China, including Weihe Clean Energy, Pucheng Clean Energy, Shaanxi Future Energy, and Shanxi Lu'an Mining. Finally, please turn to slide 23 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and profits were up versus prior year, driven by progress on the Jazan ASU sale of equipment project. We continue to make good progress on the Jazan project, and just as a reminder, we began booking profits on the sale of equipment in the fourth quarter of FY 2016. Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a comment on our Corporate segment.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 24, our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales and profits were down versus last year, as expected, on continued significantly lower LNG project activity. We were pleased to announce earlier this week a new project with TP JGC Coral France to provide our technology and heat exchanger equipment for the Coral South Floating LNG project to be located in the Indian Ocean, offshore Mozambique. However, we had anticipated this win, so still expect about a $0.30 headwind in LNG for FY 2017 versus FY 2016. We still have not yet seen other LNG customers moving forward with their investment decisions. We did see a positive impact from the TSAs with Evonik and Versum. Now please turn to slide 25 and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook. Having delivered on our promises from three years ago, we can now build on our success. We have significant opportunities to invest our cash to grow Air Products and create value for our shareholders. Our safety and operating performance continues to be strong. We continue to take action to deliver our $100 million of operational improvements this year and are focused on additional actions to offset the stranded costs from the separation of MT business. We remain committed and confident on our ability to deliver on our cost savings and our commitment to grow EPS by 10% each year. Our portfolio actions and the strong cash flow generation of our company provide us with almost $8 billion of capacity to invest over the next three years. We are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident the risk/return profile will create significant value for our shareholders. And as I said, I am now, more than ever, very confident that we will have the opportunity to fully utilize our balance sheet by investing in exciting opportunities in M&A, asset buybacks, and large industrial projects. Now, please turn to the slide number 25. With confidence in our ability to perform, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2017. Our increased guidance of $6.20 to $6.25 is up $0.10 from last quarter at midpoint, and it represent 10% EPS growth over 2016. And our guidance for the fourth quarter the fiscal year EPS is $1.65 to $1.75 (sic) [$1.70] per share, which at midpoint is 12% up versus last year. I want to thank once again the great team of hardworking, dedicated, talented, and motivated employees that remain focused on being the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. I am very proud to be a member of this winning team. Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our first question from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning. This is Emily Wagner on for Don. I just wanted to dial in to the Jazan earnings this quarter a little bit. How much of the guidance raise was due to the timing of Jazan? And I know that earnings stream there is a little lumpy. Is there any way to get some more clarity on the timing or outlook on these earnings?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Emily, first of all, good morning. The increase in our guidance is due to our confidence in the performance of our business in terms of volumes, especially in China. As Corning mentioned, we had a very good performance in Asia, better than we expected, and that is why we are – that's the principal reason we are increasing our guidance.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay?
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah. And then in terms of the consolidated volume growth of 8%, is there a way to break that down between the equipment sales and the new project startups?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: It is possible, but we don't plan to do it.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: All right. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Seifi, I wanted to ask, you were quite emphatic that you're more confident now deploying your capital. Can you give us the reason for that increased confidence?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Bob. Obviously, if I say that, that means that we are seeing more projects that we can work on. And as time goes by, we see more projects that we can work on. So, I'm sure you'll bear with me to kind of stay general, but we have always said that we see a lot of opportunities, but as we engage with customers and prospective customers, we are becoming more confident that we can actually do these things.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And Seifi, can I ask, is it conscientious on your part – I mean last quarter, you sounded much more cautious, you noted concerns about economic policy in the U.S., Brexit, geopolitical tension. And now this quarter, it seems like the volumes have popped nicely. The tone just sounds more upbeat. Is there something that's changed from your perspective, that gives you that greater confidence, or is this sort of in the macros, or is this still all idiosyncratic to your own business?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Hi, Bob. That's an excellent question. I have always been very optimistic about the performance of Air Products. The other comments that I made about the general consensus in the economy, I don't need to make any comments about that because now you see that as the headline of the paper. So, I don't want to be stating the obvious about what is going on in the U.S., its policies and the geopolitical condition. So we didn't feel it was necessary for us to stress that. As I said, you see that in the news.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. On your price and mix performance in Europe, it looks like you are basically doing okay in gaining the underlying price, but you're having some issues with recovering electric power costs. And I'm just wondering, is that something that typically has a lag, historically, or how would you expect that issue to progress going forward?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I'd like to refer that to Corning to answer. Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So, I'd just like to stress that on a real pricing basis, we see positive pricing. So, the mix impact is fairly powerful for us right now and there's two things behind that. So, on a product basis, we're selling a lot of CO2 right now, a year ago we had some production issues. It's the summer season, there's a lot going. CO2 is just a lower priced product and it's going to bring down that number. But the fact that I'm able to sell more is really a good thing for us. The other thing that's playing out in the mix effect is just larger customers taking more product. We can deliver the product to large customers more efficiently, they command and get better pricing. So, that hits as well. In terms of overcoming all that and still hitting the power, I'd say we're about 50% through, recovering what we were aiming for, and I remain confident that we're going to follow on on this and we will get that back.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And on – I realize Seifi, it's a little bit early to talk about 2018, but given your sentiments on the global macro environment and geopolitical issues, do you see any reason to doubt that you could hit the 10% long-term EPS growth target in 2018?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I said several times during the call that we promised everybody four years ago that we will hit 10% EBITDA growth over the long term. We are still committed to that. And if the geopolitical conditions and the economic conditions become tougher, then we need to take actions in order to deliver the number. The 10% is non-negotiable. We are very committed to that.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. I'd like to go back to the price issue. Your pricing on a global basis was flat and I think some of your competitors had prices up 1% to 2%. Is that difficulties in comparability or does it turn out you're not executing as well as you might in getting your prices up right now?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: When we report numbers for overall Air Products, there is significant amount of noise related to mix in terms of which part of the world, and then the pricing that we include includes our whole company, it's not just the merchant thing. Corning mentioned about different areas. We usually don't like to talk too much about pricing and all of that, but we are – I don't want to characterize it as if we are having difficulty in increasing prices. The prices in the market very much depends on the supply/demand situation and we are part of that. I wouldn't want to characterize it the way you said that we would have any difficultly on that, but Corning, do you want to make any additional comments on that?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, I think also going to where Seifi was just saying, I think the aggregation, when you do that, you lose a lot of color of what's really happening, especially on a business that is so local. So maybe just to peel back the onion one step further, we showed flat pricing in the Americas. In truth, underlying that, we had actually positive pricing in North America, negative pricing in Latin America and that kind of offset, just to give you a sense of – a little more color.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: If I may follow up, in terms of the Jazan project, that's a base case, does the equipment piece conclude by mid 2019?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Something like that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we will take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, P.J. How are you doing?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good. So, you had two write-downs in the quarter, can you explain those? The first one was in Latin America, probably in Indura assets, and then second one was in Saudi Arabia. And I know that you're trying to acquire more assets in the Middle East, but you mentioned current challenging conditions in Saudi Arabia. Does that change your strategy towards Middle Eastern acquisitions? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, P.J., thank you very much for asking the question, but there is a famous saying that the best time to buy is when things are not going well. So actually, the conditions are actually very favorable in buying things in the Middle East right now because of the oil prices being down. So I kind of actually see that as a favorable sign rather than a negative sign.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Is that okay?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So you think this is an opportunity to buy in Middle East?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes, that is correct.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, okay. And the second question on the backlog. Can you discuss the outlook for hydrogen or HyCO projects? Again, we go back to oil price and volatility there, refining margins are weak. What are you hearing in the HyCO projects?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the thing is that the HyCO projects that we are focused on are – significant part of that is related to coal gasification, and the outlook for that is very positive. In terms of HyCO projects for other projects, there are not that many new projects, but as you know, we are focused on asset buybacks and we see opportunities there.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And lastly, can you just talk about the chemical opportunity on the U.S. Gulf Coast? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, there was a lot of excitement about a lot of new projects, but then the oil prices came down, although gas prices are down, a lot of those projects they're put on hold. And you know that better than anybody else. I mean you're very knowledgeable about what everybody was trying to do. So we are in the Gulf Coast, we will participate. Obviously, you saw that project that we just announced in Geismar and there are other projects that we are working on, but I'm not as optimistic there as I am in other parts of the world.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, P.J.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. On slide 16, on maintenance capital versus growth CapEx, Praxair this quarter started reporting something related to this, CapEx towards secured contracts versus non-contracted CapEx. So, congrats in the first place on driving this change here; I was skeptical at first. But my question is how comparable are the two presentations? They indicated merchant tanks and cylinders were a large part of their growth CapEx. But since you do larger projects and you don't have a U.S. cylinder business, is the majority of your growth – or the vast majority of growth CapEx your large projects?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, John, first of all, thank you for your comment. I do appreciate that. We have always thought very strongly that looking at distributable cash is the right way to look at the valuation of industrial gases, and we are very pleased to see that others are following that. In terms of how they present their numbers and how we present, I quite honestly don't want to be making comments about what our competitors' financials are; I don't think that would be appropriate. We are very committed to the way we present the numbers and our numbers are very clear, detailed analysis and reflective of what we need to do to maintain our current EBITDA. That is the definition of maintenance CapEx that we have. That if everything stops, how much money do we need to invest in order to replace the assets that we have in order to maintain our current EBITDA. And that is our definition of maintenance CapEx.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, John.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Seifi, good volumes...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, David. How are you doing?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Thank you, very good. So very good volumes in North America, you mentioned refining, but overall, is there any acceleration in your business that you're seeing or just, again, refining and plus other is driving that very good volume growth in your business?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I don't want to characterize it as a significant acceleration of the business, but I think that we have our act together and we are trying to provide the service that our customers need in order to make sure that we get our fair share of – Corning, do you have any other comments?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I'm sorry, is your question mainly at North America or globally?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: North America. Are you seeing any acceleration, North American activity?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. I would say North America was broad based for us and, by definition, being broad based, not like one particular thing or another. I'd say just hard work in sales activity across the board.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And, Corning, also on the maintenance costs in Q3, can you quantify the impact and what that tailwind might be heading to Q4?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, so I think we're not going for specific details on it, I'd say maybe just give a little bit of color for what we experienced in this quarter. There's a little bit more around some large air separation units that we worked on and they tend to have, in some ways, a broader impact, because there's product dislocation and making up the argon and that sort of thing. But that was the nature of a certain amount of the costs for North America this quarter.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, David.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. As a large shareholder yourself, how do you believe the Air Products story will continue to evolve from here outside of the solid op execution? Just in terms of where we stand, right here, right now, can you just talk about the various views on project backlog growth versus a year ago, what you're seeing in the merchant business and then the capital deployment opportunities? Just any color on what you believe the key two to three drivers of your story are right now. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Chris, that's an excellent question. And thanks for asking the question to give me the opportunity to talk about that. We have delivered on what we promised three years ago. So, obviously, the question from the investors is, okay, I've enjoyed the past, what are you going to do for me in the future? The key thing is that now, Air Products has margins of about 33% to 35%, the best in the industry. We have our act together, therefore, we will benefit as much as anybody else on any kind of economic activity and so on going forward. But then in addition to that, the key thing is that we do have $8 billion to $10 billion of firing capacity and we do see opportunities to deploy that. Therefore, the story of Air Products for the future is deploying that capital. And if we do that, we will generate significant value for our shareholders. So that is what we are promising the investors and that is three years from now, hopefully, we will look back and say, yeah, we said we have $10 billion to deploy and we did deploy that at good returns, and that $10 billion will generate $1 billion of operating profit. That is our story going forward, and we have a lot of confidence in our ability to deploy that and deliver that. And that's the key thing, while maintaining a first-class operation, getting the pricing, getting the volumes as anybody else will do. The differentiating thing for us versus other people is the fact that we have the balance sheet to go do these things. Okay?
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Can you just walk us through the Asian business a little bit more, parsing out a little more detail on the volume front, just anything you see in key end market trends, et cetera. And then also is there anything on the pricing front you'd be willing to discuss, whether it's regional nature, slightly favorable bulk operating rates, et cetera? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I would like to make some comments and turn it over to Corning. When you look at Asia, I mean, we reported 20% increase in sales. About half of that was related to some specific equipment sales that we had, the other half is genuine growth in our business. Some of that is coming up from the new plants we are bringing onstream, but a lot of that, as Corning mentioned before, is because we do – Chinese economy is growing, and most important the utilization is going up. I think Corning will mention, and I turn it over to him, that right now if you take Asia, the utilization of industrial gas business on the merchant side is getting close to 80%. That is a very good sign and that is usually an indication that the prices will strengthen. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Seifi. Yeah. So, for sure, right now, China is the strongest economy for us in Asia, that's where I think we see most of the positive momentum in terms of strong volume growth, pricing, and so forth. Within China, as Seifi mentioned, we've broken the line to just north of 80% on our loading. I'd like to point out, that is our loading. That is not industry loading. And I would put industry loading, my estimate more in, let's say, the 60% sort of range. I would say a key thing about understanding our loading, not only is it now hitting the 80%, it is 80% with much higher retail sales than we had before, year-on-year, up like 5%, 500 basis points in terms of the proportion of the business that's retail. That helps us with pricing, that helps us with just the quality of the underlying basis. I think the other thing just to keep in mind in China, we know a sort of tailwind we have before us right now is the government getting serious about reform in the steel industry, and that has the potential to take captive capacity off the market. And to be honest with you, that's a positive for us as well right now.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thank you.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from the line of Stephen Byrne from Bank of America.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. Wanted to ask you about your sale of equipment business. Is that, as a fraction of your project backlog, likely to remain relatively stable, or could you see it going up as you pursue projects in regions that are more geopolitically challenged? Or could it possibly go down over time if there's little less aggressive offering of these services by your competitor in Germany? How do you see the outlook for that?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, our sale of equipment is not included in our backlog. We do not put that in our backlog. Our backlog is only sale of gas that would generate revenues for the longer term. Sale of equipment is a one-time thing, we don't consider that backlog. So...
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Pardon me...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: ...Those things are not included in our backlog, sir.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply the roster of projects. I meant as a business opportunity to pursue an opportunity where you sell the equipment versus build to own. That option that you have, is that driven primarily by customer demand, your preference or customer preference?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Our preference for sure, 100%, is sale of gas. We are not an equipment company to make money on sale of equipment. But considering the capabilities that we have, in order to maintain a relationship with the customer, if they insist on a sale of equipment, we do once in a while do that. But our focus and our preference has always been sale of gas, because that is our business.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And if there was less bidding activity on sale of equipment down the road, would you view that as constructive, maybe a greater opportunity for build to own?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: That is correct. That would be the case, yes.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then just lastly on the Glenmont, New York facility, is that region in your merchant business tightening up, that would justify building a bigger liquid plant in that region? And why pursue that as a JV with Linde instead of go it alone?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, there was a tightening of the market and there is additional capacity required, and what made sense was that rather than us building another 300 or 400 ton-a-day plant to meet the requirements, it made sense to build a 1,200 ton-a-day plant, which is a lot more efficient, and at the end of the day, it's good for the customers because our cost base for both companies is lower and, therefore, the customers benefit. So that is actually a good thing for our customers and it also creates opportunity to produce the gas at a lower cost.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, this is Matthew on for Kevin. I don't want to kind of beat the equipment sales dead horse here, but kind of just trying to track it down a little bit. Would it be fair to say the equipment sales in Asia were about $45 million year-over-year? And kind of what does the EBIT margin look like on that business? I'm guessing it'd be higher than the segment average. And maybe you touched on this a little bit, but what should we expect in 4Q 2018 as far as new equipment sale order book?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: As I've told you, we are not focused on equipment sales, we don't consider that to be a significant part of our business, and I don't think you should expect too much on that. That is not what drives our business, that's not what we are focused. We are not like some other industrial gases business, where half of their business is equipment sale. That is not – that has never been our focus and it will not be. We are – that's not a big deal for us.
Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I get that. I'm just trying to kind of effectively strip it out of the numbers to maybe to get a better sense of what ongoing profitability will look like in the Asia segment. Just trying to make apples-to-apples basically.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We have tried to make sure that we do give you that visibility, because when we report Gases Americas or Gases Europe or Gases Asia, it doesn't have equipment sales in it because that is – it's all in Global Gases.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: So, maybe just one clarification to that. When we have, in this case, some gas handling equipment that is in the Asia segment, I don't think we're going to go into the exact quantification because it's a small group of customers and so forth. I will say it was a positive impact on our margins. But the nature of this was not something that's going to repeat every day. As Seifi says, I wouldn't be expecting that going forward.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: But there is a difference that we need to kind of make sure that the investors understand. One thing is sale of equipment in terms of selling an air separation unit. The other thing is that when we deal with, specifically, with our electronic customers. The electronic customer sometimes require equipment which is related to the delivery of gas and purifying of the gas. That we do do for our customers, we do that for our electronic customers, and that specific area did contribute some to our Asian results. But your question was equipment sales on the major air separation units, and I said we are not focused on that. But for some of our electronic customers, as a matter of necessity, when we build them a nitrogen generator – high-purity nitrogen generator, there are equipment related to the delivery of that to the customer, we do provide those equipment, and those are in the category of equipment sale, but they are not air separation units.
Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thanks. Nice quarter.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I just wanted to ask on the LNG weakness, you said $0.30 for 2017 and despite the, I guess, the new plants that was in line. Should we be done with this headwind moving into 2018 or do you think there's still a little bit of a drag from it?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, obviously in that business, which was such a lumpy business, it's difficult to predict, but right now, if you wanted to be pessimistic, there might be another $0.04 or $0.05 hit to us in 2018 because of LNG.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. If I could just ask one...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: That's the way it looks right now. Yeah.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And was there any way we could get you to break out the organic volume versus the new projects and everything else?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: For where, for...
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, regionally or globally, however you'd be willing to do it.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, organic volumes, most of the volumes that we reported was organic except in Asia, where we said that half of the 20% was equipment. So, Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, I think we said...
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, also, I guess, I'm trying to break out just sort of base business versus new project startups versus equipment sale, just the base business.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Understood, understood. So I think the main energy is around Asia, that's where we had the biggest impact on it. And if you're looking at that 20% we had, about half of that was the equipment, the other half was on our gas side, and I'd say roughly 50/50 on that in terms of volume between new projects and just organic merchant growth.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, I mentioned that in my opening remarks, in the other question that out of that, as Corning said, about 10% is equipment that we do for electronic customers, the other 10%, half of it is new project startups and half of it is organic growth.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: So we had 5% organic growth.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Vincent.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning. I have just two quick ones. First, do you expect over the next two, three years to get back to the pattern of EBITDA growth in each region, outpacing organic growth? And I think you've been pretty clear about the dynamics that have caused this quarter to have its characteristics. So just want to see if you expect those trends to reverse. And secondly, just eyeballing the backlog, is it fair to put roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion worth of gases startups in terms of capital that's going to be ramping up in 2018 and a tailwind into 2019? Is that roughly a good bogey?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, first of all, with respect to the growth thing, I think we have always said that when you are looking at different regions of the world, in mature economies, our EBITDA will grow with economic development, and our volumes will grow with GDP. In emerging markets it is – if industrial production is 2%, usually, gases grow more than that, about 1.2, 1.3 times that. So I expect our EBITDA growth in the growth markets like China and India would be better than that. With respect to the other question that you had, Simon, do you want to make some comments on that?
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. I think, Laurence was asking about the amount of the backlog we expect to come on in 2018. I think, Laurence, as usual, it's hard to know exactly when these projects are going to come onstream, so I think we'll give you more clarity on 2018 when we get to October.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Yeah. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Then we do our forecast for the year.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. At this time, then, I would like to – since there are no other questions, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and those of you who are in the Northern Hemisphere, have a great summer. Take care. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

We do not expect this filing to provide any new material information for investors. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered very strong performance this quarter. This is the result of the hard work and commitment of our people and their continued focus on executing our strategic Five-Point Plan. For our second quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.43, up $0.06 over last year and $0.03 above the top of our guidance range for the quarter. Please note that this is the 12th consecutive quarter that we are reporting year-on-year EPS growth. Now please turn to slide number 3 related to our very strong safety performance. Talking about safety, I think it is appropriate at this point to take a moment to remember Mr. Ed Donley, who passed away earlier this month. Ed was Chairman of Air Products from 1978 to 1986, and CEO from 1973 to 1986. He led Air Products through some challenging times and positioned the company in several areas for the success we continue to have today. But for Ed, safety was the foundation. He emphasized that it required everyone's total commitment. I am very pleased to say that his idea carries on. Today at Air Products, nothing is more important than the safety of our people and our safety results demonstrate this commitment and I'm very pleased with the progress that the company has made in the last few years. Please turn to slide number 4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Now please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rate. As you know, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company, something that I take very seriously. I do want to take a moment and expand on the opportunities and the discipline required for the effective deployment of our cash. First, let's talk about how much capacity we do have to invest. Scott will go through the details later, but today we have about $2.5 billion of cash to invest and, in addition, we have the capacity to borrow an additional amount in the range of $2.5 billion while maintaining our targeted A and A2 rating. So, that gives us about $5 billion that we can invest today. In addition, we expect to generate over $1 billion a year in investable cash, that is after we pay taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx, and dividends. So over the next three years, we expect to have at least an additional $3 billion and therefore a total of $8 billion to invest. We do remain confident, and I like to stress the word confident, that we can deploy the $8 billion into high return value-creating investments in our core Industrial Gases business. Our three key areas of focus for the investments are, first, acquisition of small and medium-sized industrial gas companies. As you know, in January, we indicated our interest in acquiring Yingde Gases, a Hong Kong listed company and a major industrial gas company in China. In March, we decided that we were no longer interested in purchasing the company at this time. This is a great example of the discipline required to effectively deploy the capital. We do our homework and then based on that homework, we decide what is the right thing to do. We are not just enamored with spending money to become bigger. We are about carefully evaluating the risk of investing and making sure we have good returns for our shareholders. The second area of opportunity is to purchase existing industrial gas facilities from customers and create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customers based on a fixed fee. We see opportunities for oxygen and hydrogen plants around the world in this category. We also see the opportunity to expand our scope of supply to include the operation of existing gasification units and sale of syngas to customers under long-term agreements. Essentially, these opportunities are the same as the traditional onsite business model, something that we do every day, so we are not reinventing the wheel, but with existing rather than new production assets. And the third area of opportunity for us to invest is the very, very large industrial gas projects around the world driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy and emerging market growth. The Jazan project in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how big these projects can be. The plant that we are building in Jazan is the largest project in the history of industrial gas industry, with close to $2 billion of capital investment. Some of these new large projects could also include gasification and syngas. So we remain optimistic we can create significant shareholder value by investing in our core Industrial Gases business. But as I have always said, if for some reason we cannot find enough good projects, we will stay disciplined and return the cash to our shareholders. We will still have the cash, and after all, it is your money. And I know everyone is very interested for us to give them a timeline for how fast we can deploy the cash. But as I said, we are not in a hurry and we will take our time to make sure that we are investing in value creating projects. Now, please turn to slide number 6, there you can see our Five-Point Plan that continues to provide the framework for our success. We have already completed four of these steps, and we continue to work on changing the culture of Air Products by focusing on safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence. Now, kindly turn to page number 7, there you can see the results for our three key metrics. We remain committed to our goal to become the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, as measured by each of these three key metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward. Now, please turn to my favorite slide, which is slide number 8. I think it is appropriate to comment on the decline that you see on the reported EBITDA margins this quarter. First, we had a negative mix effect in our sales of equipment business. We are recognizing substantially higher sale of equipment to the Jazan joint venture in the big project we are building in Saudi Arabia, which is at lower margins than 35%. In addition, we are seeing, as mentioned last quarter, significantly lower sales of LNG equipment, which carry a higher margin than 35%. Second, due to the higher price of natural gas, we report higher sales with no profit, since the costs are passed through to our customers. If we adjust for the effect of these factors, our underlying margins are down less than 50 basis points and is still above 35%. And even if you look at the 32.9%, I'm happy to say that we are still the most profitable industrial gas company in the world with a higher EBITDA margin than anybody else even at 32.9%. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then, as always, we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now, please turn to slide 9 for a more detailed review of our Q2 results. Sales of almost $2 billion increased 11% versus last year on 7% higher volumes and 5% higher energy pass-through, slightly offset by a 1% unfavorable currency impact. Volumes were higher across Asia, North America and Europe. Latin America continues to be challenged by a weak economy. Taken together, the industrial gas regions increased overall volumes by 2%. In our sale of equipment businesses, continued progress on our Jazan project more than offset the expected weakness in LNG. Jazan and LNG, taken together, increased volumes by 5%. Corning and Simon will provide additional comments later. Pricing remains largely unchanged across our businesses. EBITDA of $652 million improved by 2% and operating income of $406 million improved by 4%. EBITDA margin of 32.9% and operating margin of 20.5% decreased by 300 basis points and 150 basis points, respectively. The EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by 140 basis points from higher energy pass-through costs in the Americas and EMEA, and by 120 basis points due to the different business mix in our sale of equipment businesses. As Seifi said, our ASU sales are up significantly with the Jazan project, and our LNG sales are down significantly. LNG margins are typically higher than ASU sale of equipment margins. So, this different business mix reduces margins. Excluding these two impacts, the underlying EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points, impacted in part by the ramp-up of zero margin utility cost pass-through in Asia and higher power and fuel costs in our liquid/bulk business. In addition, our productivity efforts this quarter were offset by higher maintenance costs. Sequential operating margin is down 120 basis points, 30 basis points of the decline is due to higher energy cost pass-through, while the rest is from cost, including higher maintenance expenses. Versus prior year, net income increased by 5%, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 4%. ROCE of 12.3% improved by 70 basis points versus last year. Now please turn to slide 10. You know that Air Products continues to be very focused on cash flow. Our distributable cash flow was over $300 million this quarter, while our free cash flow was negative $46 million. Free cash flow was down $156 million versus last year despite higher EBITDA, mainly due to higher cash taxes and higher maintenance capital spending due to plant replacement projects. As I've said in the past, these items move around quarter-to-quarter. And to be clear, this does not include any of the $3.8 billion we received this quarter from the sale of our PMD business. Now turning to slide 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I discuss our continuing operations results, I want to mention that in discontinued operations, we recorded a large $1.8 billion after-tax gain associated with the PMD divestiture that was finalized in early January. In continuing operations, we had non-GAAP items that totaled $0.04 per share or about $14 million pre-tax for both cost actions and pension settlement costs. We expect these to continue through the year as we take further actions as part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and to offset stranded costs from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.43 increased $0.06 per share or 4% versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.08 per share. Pricing, energy and raw material taken together decreased EPS by $0.03. This was driven in part by higher power costs in our Europe business and we will be working hard to recover these costs. Net cost performance was unchanged as our productivity actions and the TSA income were roughly offset by higher maintenance costs, inflation and cost associated with pursuing Yingde. As a reminder, included in the cost major factor is the other income (expense) line on the consolidated P&L. As I shared last quarter, we are providing services via transition service agreements, or TSAs, to both Versum and Evonik. The cost to provide these services are primarily are primarily in SG&A. The payment we received for these services was about $10 million this quarter, and is shown in the other income (expense) line. We would expect these TSAs to wind down in 2018, and are committed to taking actions to reduce the resulting stranded costs. For the quarter, currency and foreign exchange gains and losses netted to a zero impact. Equity affiliate income increased by $0.01 per share. Interest expense was $0.02 higher, primarily due to lower capitalized interest as the benefit from our lower debt balance was offset by higher rates. We've added a new line to our income statement this quarter called other non-operating income (expense). This is where we are reporting the interest income from our cash and short-term investments. Historically, interest income was a very modest amount. So, we included it in our other income (expense) line, and therefore it was in our operating income. Since, we now have more than $3 billion in cash and short-term investments, and are generating more interest income, we've begun reporting interest income as non-operating income. Interest income contributed $0.03 this quarter. And since it is non-operating, it is not included in our EBITDA or operating income results. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 23.7%, basically unchanged from last year. We still expect our FY 2017 tax rate to be approximately 23%. Turning to slide 12, I would also like to expand on Seifi's comments regarding our capital deployment capacity. We have about $3.3 billion of cash and short-term investments as of March 31. After we pay the rest of the taxes due on the PMD gain and maintain a modest operating cash balance, we have about $2.5 billion of cash available to invest. Our debt balance as of March 31 is about $3.8 billion. As you know, we are committed to managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. We expect this would enable a debt level in the range of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. Based on a trailing 12 months EBITDA of $2.7 billion, this would support a debt level of about $6 billion. So in total, between available cash and additional debt capacity, we have about $5 billion we can deploy today, while maintaining our A/A2 rating. As Seifi mentioned, we also expect to generate over $1 billion per year of investable cash, that is after paying taxes, interest, maintenance CapEx, and dividend. So, over the next three years, we see a total of over $8 billion available to invest. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. In recent quarters, we've driven our results more by productivity than by growth. In this quarter, I'm pleased to report that our commercial efforts have paid off in positive growth pretty much across the board. At the same time, I am disappointed that our underlying productivity did not fully translate to the bottom line. There are reasons for this, including higher planned maintenance this quarter, and we have a lot of cost progress behind us. But we continue to be excited by the opportunity ahead of us. There is more to come in productivity. I would like to thank our people around the world for staying focused on our goals, notably safety, excellent customer service and our Taking the Lead productivity projects. Some examples of what we're doing right now include piloting new third-party routing software in China, introducing a new e-commerce platform for mobility, and replicating our European e-tactical planning system in North America. These actions will improve customer experience, sales, and efficiency. Now, please turn to slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Underlying sales were up 2% but pass-through of higher energy prices, with Houston Ship Channel natural gas prices up over 50%, significantly diluted our margins. Specifically, sales of $890 million were up 12% versus last year with volume and price both up 1%, and higher energy cost pass-through up 9%. North American volumes increased Americas volumes by 1% as we saw positive volumes across almost all product lines. Latin American volumes were down 3% versus last year, but the contribution to overall Americas volumes rounded to zero. Although not as drastic as in previous quarters, weak Latin American packaged gases demand continued. In contrast, liquid/bulk continues to rebound on new signings and improved demand. There are no substantial new onstreams for us in Latin America in our P&L. So, the movements here are purely merchant. EBITDA of $354 million was up 4% and operating income of $225 million was flat versus last year. EBITDA was up more than operating income, in part due to stronger equity affiliate income this year, due to higher maintenance costs at one of our joint ventures last year. Equity affiliate income impacts EBITDA but not operating income. EBITDA and operating margins were each down about 300 basis points, with higher energy cost pass-through accounting for all the EBITDA margin movement, and 190 basis points of the operating margin movement. So, the underlying EBITDA margin was flat, and the underlying operating margin was down 90 basis points. This was primarily driven by higher maintenance costs, due to customer planned maintenance outages, more than offsetting our Take the Lead cost reduction program. We do expect to see additional outages impacting cost during Q3. It was good to see the 1% price impact on sales, but from a margin perspective, this put us just slightly ahead of diesel and power cost increases. Finally, we anticipate a reduction of about $70 million in North American sales in FY 2018, with the end of our supply contract for liquid/bulk products to Airgas. As you would expect, we are working hard to replace this volume. We were pleased to be awarded an expansion of our hydrogen supply to Marathon Petroleum in Garyville, Louisiana. We expect the new 300 million (sic) [30 million] standard cubic foot a day expansion of our existing relationship to commence later this year. The additional hydrogen will be provided from our Gulf Coast pipeline system, the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline network, spanning more than 600 miles from the Houston Ship Channel to New Orleans with 22 hydrogen production facilities. Now, please turn to slide 14 for our Europe, Middle East and Africa business. Volume strengthened and profits were up on a constant currency basis. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 2%, with currency more than offsetting higher underlying volumes and higher energy cost pass-through. Our volumes were up 1%, as stronger packaged gases and retail liquid/bulk sales more than overcame lost hydrogen sales during a major planned outage. We were also very pleased to bring onstream the first phase of our new hydrogen and ASU project for BPCL in India. This first phase came onstream late in the quarter and additional phases are expected to come onstream in the third quarter. This 100% Air Products-owned facility will be reported in EMEA segment, while the rest of our India business continues to be reported in Asia equity affiliate income. Reported pricing was flat but was positive, excluded a negative customer mix, as we began recovering the higher power cost from the first half of the year in our merchant business. Higher energy cost pass-through contributed 3% and currency had a negative 6% impact, primarily due to the British pound. Other than the continued currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote had much impact on our business this quarter. Volumes were up 2% sequentially, primarily on stronger merchant sales. Operating income of $87 million was down 4% and EBITDA of $136 million was down 6%, but both would have been up on a constant currency basis, as our productivity actions and volume growth offset the impact from higher power costs and planned maintenance outages . The EBITDA margin of 32.9% was down $160 basis points, with almost two-thirds of the decrease due to higher energy pass-through, with the balance due to planned maintenance outages and higher power costs. Operating margin of 20.9% was down 40 basis points, and would have been up slightly excluding the impact of higher energy cost pass-through. Please turn to slide 15, Gases Asia, where you can see that the strength in our merchant business and the ramp-up of our new plants continue to deliver growth. Sales of $436 million were up 7%, driven 8% by volume growth. The volume growth was roughly 50-50 split between underlying sales growth and utility pass-through volume, as our onsite customers ramp up their gasifiers. Our merchant business was up mid to high single-digits across Asia, and our China LOX/LIN business was up high single-digits, with particular strength in the retail portion of the business. Sequential volumes were down slightly on Lunar New Year seasonality. Overall, China pricing was flat, as helium price headwinds were offset by positive pricing for other products. China LOX/LIN pricing was again slightly positive versus prior year. Operating income of $112 million was up 7%, and EBITDA of $174 million was up 2%. Equity affiliate income was down due to a one-time benefit last year associated with exiting a small joint venture. This impacts EBITDA but not operating income. Operating margin of 25.7% was flat versus last year, as the increased utility pass-through volume, which is by definition at zero margin, diluted the increased operating income. Similarly, the EBITDA margin of 40% was down 200 basis points versus last year, due to the utility pass-through volume dilution impact and the lower equity affiliate income. We continue to successfully execute projects throughout Asia. In China, we recently brought on stream two plants. The first in Guangdong, supports a leading supplier to the high-tech display industry; the second supplies Chongqing HKC Optoelectronics, who are building China's leading LCD panel fab in western China. Both of these are examples of how we are positioned to win in China's push for high-end manufacturing for the 13th Five-Year Plan and the Made in China 2025 strategy. In Korea, we were pleased to bring on stream the first phase of our facilities, which supply a new semiconductor fab in Pyeongtaek. This past January, we announced the second phase to support increased demand of the same customer. Our business in India continues to show strong results. To support the strong demand growth, we have announced last week that our INOX Air Products equity joint venture will build six new plants to serve the onsite and merchant business. These investments will further strengthen our leadership position in India's merchant industrial gases market. Finally, please turn to slide 16 for a brief comment on our Global Gases segment, which includes most of our air separation unit sale of equipment business as well as central industrial gas business costs. Sales and profits were up versus prior year driven by progress on the Jazan ASU sale of equipment project this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a comment on our Corporate segment.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 17. Our Corporate segment includes our LNG business, our helium container business and our corporate costs. Sales and profits were down versus last year on continued significantly lower LNG project activity. As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, and we continue to expect at least a $0.30 headwind in LNG for FY 2017 versus FY 2016. We did see a positive impact from the TSAs with Evonik and Versum. Now, please turn to slide 18, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, again, Simon. Before we take your questions, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook. As we move forward, I want to remind our shareholders that Air Products is in a very strong position. Our safety and operating performance continue to be strong. We have taken action to deliver our $100 million of operational improvements this year and are focused on additional action to offset the stranded cost from the separation of Materials Technologies business. We remain committed and confident in our ability to deliver on our cost savings and our EPS commitments. Our portfolio actions and the strong cash flow generation of our company provides us with almost $5 billion of capacity to invest now and over $1 billion per year in addition for the future. So over the next three years, we expect to have at least $8 billion to deploy and we certainly intend to deploy that. We are committed to staying disciplined and won't invest our money unless we are confident the risk-return profile will create significant value for our shareholders. And we see exciting opportunities to invest in M&A, asset buybacks and large industrial gas projects. However, we do continue to be cautious about the future. That was the investment we made in January and we have seen no significant reason to change our view. We continue to be concerned about the lack of concrete economic policy in the United States, the effect of Brexit on the UK and European economies, and overall geopolitical tensions in the Far and Middle East. I would like to stress that the fact that we are cautious is not in any way, shape or form related to specific issues at Air Products. Air Products is doing well and you see that in the numbers and we continue to believe that Air Products by itself will continue to do well. But we cannot ignore the overall economic and geopolitical situation around the world and that is the reason for our cautious approach. With this background, we are maintaining our guidance for full year 2017 at EPS of $6 to $6.25 per share with the (sic) [which at] midpoint, which is a substantial increase, of 9% over the previous year. And our guidance for the third quarter fiscal year 2017 EPS is $1.55 to $1.60 per share, which is also up 9% versus last year at midpoint. At this point, again, I want to thank all of the employees of Air Products for their continued hard work and commitment in delivering another strong quarter of results in safety and financial performance. I am very proud to be a member of this winning team. Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: And thank you. We do have our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, P.J. How are you doing this morning?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Doing good. Couple of questions on M&A. First on your Yingde acquisition, was that an opportunistic move on your part or was it more strategic? And if it was strategic, can you drill down more into that, why China, why now? And the second question is on, any potential to get into packaged gases, which is more fragmented area, so maybe it's easier to get in, and would you consider that in Latin America, where you already have Indura assets? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, P.J. Our decision to pursue Yingde is definitely strategic. When you look at the projections of the GDP at purchase prosperity, by 2030, it is projected that China will have a GDP of about $33 billion, by far the largest economy in the world. That is where the growth is right now. The growth is in China and in India by any kind of a measure. Therefore it was strategic and that we will continue to be focused on China. There are a lot of other opportunities other than Yingde and we are pursuing those, and I hope in the not too distant a future, we have some more news on that. With respect to packaged gases, we are in the packaged gases business everywhere except the United States. So, the places that we are in packaged gases like in Latin America, like in Europe, like in China, we definitely are interested in expanding our packaged gases business. We continue to look at acquisitions in that area. The only area that we are not and we don't intend to be in packaged gases business is in the United States, because we believe that just the competition makes it very difficult to make money.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. I was at the Annual IHS Conference recently and it sounded like China had worked out some of the early problems with their coal-to-MEG processes and were going forward with a number of projects. I assume those are going to be new oxygen for gasification for the glycol units there. Are you seeing activity there pick up at all?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: First of all, good morning, John. Yes, we are. This is why in the past call on, say, two years, we have been saying that we don't see any slowdown in coal gasification in China. We actually see opportunities. We do see opportunities. We are very well-positioned there. We already have three gigantic coal gasification plants operational, where we are supplying oxygen successfully to our customers. Those plants are running well. We are getting paid and we will be pursuing those from a good pole position.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: And could you talk about the complexities that are trying to de-captivate more hydrogen from the refining industry. I think that was, early on, one of the key opportunities that you envisioned, but it seems like it's taking a fair amount of time.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Those opportunities are still there. It is going to take a fair amount of time because this is not a quick process, we have to demonstrate to people that we can create value, but we have a lot of projects underway and we are talking to customers and hopefully in time we will have appropriate news for you.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning. How are you?
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm well. I'm trying to reconcile maybe some competitor commentary and maybe broader industrial end market commentary in the U.S. with the still fairly anemic volume growth. Is there something particular to your asset base or chassis relative to where the growth is coming from in North America or do you think there really isn't much industrial growth in North America at the moment?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I'd like Corning to comment more on this, but first of all, there isn't anything unique about our portfolio that would prevent us from participating in economic growth if there is some. But the economic growth in the U.S. is not that much. It is – when you look at industrial production and all of that, so it is not that positive, but we have seen growth in the – actually when you look at gases volumes in the U.S. – I'm sure Corning will comment on this – but this is the first time in about six quarters that we're actually seeing growth. So, there is some, but we don't have any competitive disadvantage there. Corning, would you like to expand on this?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes. So, thank you, Bob, for the opportunity. So, we feel good about our volume growth that we had. You see the headline looking at overall Americas, obviously, that's impacted heavily on LOX/LIN, and there's also some HyCO sales in that, and that's impacted when we have outages. But if we were going to look at some of the core products, liquid hydrogen, helium, argon, our growth rates are substantially higher in those areas, and I think that's particularly important to us.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful and for my follow-up. Seifi, we're not used to referencing raw material problems in Gases margins, is this specifically to some shorter duration business or you have some contracts that don't have escalators in for energy pass-throughs?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Bob, we call it raw materials, but it is all power. I mean, obviously air is free, but the power cost, that is what is driving that line. And we mentioned this thing last quarter, that significant number of the nuclear power plants in France were down, that pushed up their power prices. That has subsided, so in the future quarters you wouldn't see that, but that is what is driving that number.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: And if I could, that's obviously in our merchant business, right. We continue to have very robust pass-through of energy costs in our tonnage and onsite business.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Sorry about that. And our next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes on some of the other various drivers in your merchant businesses across both developed and emerging markets? I know you mentioned France on the former, but also if you could hit on China on the latter. And then also, maybe just what you're seeing in terms of operating rates in the Chinese market as well, especially your longer term assumptions. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure, Chris. Corning, I think, will address that.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So let's start with the operating rates. So operating rates for us are in the 70s around the world. Actually our highest rates are in Asia, where they're in the upper 70s and that would include China. The merchant business, by its virtue, is one that sees a wide range of customers, so that's what I would say is the driver for us, no specific one industry but a wide range of opportunities. And in general, throughout the world, but particularly in China, we've driven a lot of strength in moving from retail to wholesale. So that's at a ratio really where it should be – I'm sorry, from wholesale to retail, and that's now at a ratio that's sort of at a global world-class for us. So all in all, I'd say the merchant business is positive for us. Even in South America, the liquid/bulk business for us has been a positive last quarter and this quarter.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And actually, if I may, just on Brazil, a few different companies this morning have actually highlighted continued sluggishness, I'd say actually at best, outside of a few select consumer and healthcare-driven markets. Can you just walk us through a few key end markets there and just comment on what you're seeing on a sequential basis? And then even what you're hearing from some of your industrial customers. Thank you.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So let me start. First of all, when you look at our results in South America, again you're really just seeing a pure merchant play. And in Latin America, where largely, in terms of 100% owned and reported results, is for us Chile, Brazil and Colombia for the most part, different economies who have different issues in them. So in the Chilean economy, very much related to mining, and I would say there had been strengthening earlier, but the Chilean economy still remains somewhat weak. I think the political situation there is a drag on the economy until the next election. On the positive side, the big strike at one of the copper mines is behind us now. In Brazil, of course, you've got Carnival effect in this particular quarter, which is always a large impact for us. I'd say the strength that we see there in the liquid/bulk versus in the packaged gas business, you could read that larger companies, more likely to be in an export sort of an industry, are doing better for us than perhaps people who are just serving the local market. Does that help?
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes, it's great detail. Thank you.
Operator: And now for our next question from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Steve, if you could check your mute function, please.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Why don't you move on to the next question.
Operator: I'll do that. We've got Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Seifi, regarding your cautiousness on the geopolitical outlook, aside from that, we are seeing a little bit of a pickup here in some of your organic volumes and maybe some pricing in various regions of the world, North America and Europe. What would you have to see, what would have to occur to make you less cautious on the geopolitical side?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Very simply, a very concrete economic policy that has passed Congress and it is enacted into law, so that we can make an assessment of what is happening in the United States. The second one is a concrete indication of what Brexit actually is going to mean. And the third thing is going to be hopefully a lessening of tensions in Far East and in the Middle East, that we are not going to get into another war. Those would be the three things. Please, Jim, we are cautious about the future because we don't know what is going to happen in the future, so we need to be cautious about that. But as I said, Air Products is doing fine and we are very confident about what Air Products does, but if something significant happens, we need to be prepared for that. But right now, everything about the U.S. economy is a guess. Nothing has passed Congress into law, whether it is taxes, whether it is infrastructure projects, nothing has passed into law, so we don't know what to expect and that's why we are being cautious. And Brexit, there is a lot of discussion about what's going to happen. One day it's going to be a hard negotiation, one day it's going to be soft negotiation. Now we are going to have election in UK. So, those are the ones that makes us a little bit cautious. Well, maybe we are too cautious, but that's usually not a bad thing.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then regarding your $8 billion capital deployment figure. You talked about a three-year timeframe for deploying that capital. And could you just elaborate a little further on how you think about deploying that capital internally through growth versus returning cash to shareholders? Do you stop every year or so and decide how you separate those two goals, or would you start to remunerate shareholders only after the three-year time period is up for assessing M&A opportunities?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Jim, first of all, I'd just like to clarify, I didn't give you a three-year timeline. So, the timeline is open. Number two, currently, we don't have any plans to return money to the shareholders because we think we can deploy the money. As time goes by, we'll see how well we are doing. I mean, if in the first year and the second year, we have deployed zero, then I think the strategy will change. But overall, as I said before, considering what we are working on, we continue to be confident that we can put that money to work in good returns and create value for our shareholders. That is what distinguishes Air Products from the other companies. That is our future. That is why we are not interested in big mergers and acquisitions. That's why, we are not running after buying another big company, because we do have the capability and a clear vision of what we are going to do. Air Products is going to do very well [as a] standalone, we don't need anybody's help.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Yes, good morning. Seifi. How are you?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I'm very fine, Kevin, and yourself?
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Well, thank you. I wanted to ask you about the capital deployment and specifically, the category of DCAPs that you mentioned versus acquisitions in large projects. Just wondering if you could educate us a little bit more on how you see the opportunity set there? For example, I imagine, it would take quite a lot of a DCAP deals to go about one by one and address individual oxygen or hydrogen units. And so, I'm wondering, if you see larger collections of assets and counterparties that would be, perhaps interested in doing a more wholesale a deal. And also why is it that things are apparently moving a bit slowly? For example, is there a dearth of interested counterparties at this particular juncture, or is that not the case and maybe there's just a wide bid-ask on the economics? Any color there would be appreciated.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. Kevin, we are chasing pretty sizable projects. In order to deploy the $8 billion, it sounds like a lot of money, if we just had another four Jazan projects, that deploys all of the cash. We are pursuing very big projects and, as a result, it's going to take time, it's going to be more difficult, it's going to be more complicated, but that is the reason that we remain confident. There are people who are very interested in talking to us about gasification, about expanding our scope of supply to syngas, those projects are all $2 billion, $3 billion projects. And in addition with the hydrogen, yes, we are looking at, sometimes, kind of making a wholesale deal with people in terms of acquiring many plants rather than just one or two plants. And in addition to that, there is a possibility that some assets will come available as a result of the merger of some other companies, so we are looking at all of that. So, putting all of that together, again at this stage, we believe we can deploy the cash, but time – thank you, Kevin.
Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure, sir.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna International Group.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning. This is Emily Wagner on for Don. Just a question on EMEA. I noticed you mentioned you were gaining positive pricing but this was offset by customer mix. Can you just describe the dynamic there and is there an opportunity to increase pricing to help offset the currency headwinds?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. The issue for us in pricing has, to date, really been around the power cost that Seifi referred to earlier that incurred in the first half. What's happened is we have made moves to recover those power cost increases. We've actually recovered about 50% of it so far. You don't see that when you look at that slide right now, because at the same time, we had a mix in our customers where large customers took more product. And typically, with a large customer, our cost of supply is less, and therefore the pricing is less. So, for example, the person who takes a large container or a large load of helium in liquid phase versus in gaseous phase, lower cost of supply per molecule, lower molecule price to them. So, that's what's going on. If we were going to look at, let's just say, March, where power rates were more where we expect them to run for the rest of the year and the overall gains we've made in pricing, we see ourselves well on track to recover the remaining 50%. So, we're quite confident on that. I'd rather not go into a timing discussion of that because I think that has some commercial implications for us in negotiations, but we think we're in a good position there.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thanks very much. Seifi, you indicated that you were no longer pursuing Yingde. I was wondering how you came to the decision to no longer pursue it. And then in the way you termed it at the beginning of the call, you said that we're choosing no longer to pursue Yingde at this time. So, does that mean that under a different set of circumstances you might pursue it again?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Jeff, first of all, good morning. And as usual, you've always asked very good questions. I did use my words very carefully when I said at this time, because you never know what happens in terms of how the events turn out. There were many reasons that we decided to stop. And what did stop mean? If we wanted to pursue it, it means that we would have had to offer more than $6 a share. We decided that this is not the time to do that. At some future time, it might be the time to do that. So, I just wanted to not close the door there.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And when we look across your businesses, there's very slow growth for the industrial gas company and pricing is roughly zero or close to zero. So, does that mean that your products might have to reassess its cost initiatives again to see whether it can lift returns by another means?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the thing is that – there is no question that the pricing is flat and the volume growth in the merchant business is nothing to write home about. We fully understand that. And that is why Air Products has chosen not to significantly expand our merchant business and our packaged gases business, and you know very well that that's why we didn't pursue some opportunities in that area. We are focused on the large onsite projects and there are plenty of those projects to pursue. So, we believe that we will be able – by pursuing those projects, we will continue to be able to maintain our margins. Our goal is to maintain our margins at around 35%. And if because of the circumstances or certain events in the world, we would need to take a look at improving our productivity and our cost position in order to maintain our margins, we certainly will do that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning. How are you, Dave?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Thank you. Just on pricing in North America, Seifi, I know it remains challenging right now, but what's the potential, do you think, over the next two to three years for some pricing traction to be gained here in North America?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Dave, you do know that it will be very difficult for us to make any comments about prices. So, I would like to take a rain check on that, if you don't mind, Dave.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Just lastly on the maintenance costs that we're seeing, a little bit elevated currently. Can you quantify the impact and how that might benefit perhaps Q4 or even next year?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I think Corning should address that. I obviously don't like it, but Corning will have comments on that.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: So, I'd say we're in the neighborhood of $0.03 for us on maintenance in this quarter. We'll see a slightly higher – also we'll see, relative to last year, higher costs next quarter, fourth quarter we'll be a little less. Let me just stress though, these are maintenance costs, and we're talking about hydrogen SMRs largely being what swings the numbers around. These are plants that come down every three years, four years for maintenance. And so it's, by its nature, lumpy. I think we have made great progress in this area. And the outage that we took this last quarter in Europe, that plant had been operating for over 1,300 days, right. And we're going to push and push with regulatory people, the right to continue to operate that plant longer, as we've gotten smarter and better in how we operate and maintain these plants on the fly. So, I think there's a positive story there, but we're always going to have this up and down as when this project is scheduled.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Next question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Mike. How are you? You have another difficult question for me, huh?
Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Doing well. Thank you. Yes, I'll try. Looking for some color on replacing the $70 million of lost revenue to Airgas, do you have efforts underway already to find the new customers to replace that? And how much of a headwind could that loss be to your capacity utilization? In other words, trying to get to an idea of what the decremental margin could look like on that $70 million.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Corning, will answer the question, but I just want to say that we were not making a lot of money selling anything to Airgas, so that's why we have stopped, but – Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So, you can imagine, we have known for quite a long time where this contract – when it was going to terminate. We're on it. We've got people focused on filling in the volumes. I'd rather not talk a lot about particular progress or margins just because I think that gives one competitor, in particular, a pretty good ability to calculate into our economics.
Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. And then, was also hoping that you could comment on the Jazan project in the Global Gases segment. The $24.5 million in EBITDA for this quarter, can we model a similar EBITDA number for Q3 and Q4? Can you give us any guidance on that?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, we don't want to give you any numbers, but I would like to say that the Jazan project is making good progress. We are on schedule. We are on plan. So I don't see any reason why the number – why we would have any kind of a significant change there. But overall, I'd rather not break it down because then you have to break down what is the negative effect of LNG and all of that. But overall, for Jazan, we are doing fine.
Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just have one question left and I'm just hoping, Scott, you can maybe boil down all the moving parts on the margin, we x-out the pass-through. Just give us some guidance on how we should be modeling underlying margins for the balance of the fiscal year sequentially would be helpful.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. Scott, do you want to comment?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Absolutely. So, maybe just let me reiterate here for this quarter versus last year. So, we have a 140 basis point decline from the higher energy pass-through and then a 120 impact from the SOE mix as was described, which leaves an underlying margin down of about 40 basis points. Then as we move forward, and we don't know where natural gas is going to go, we've given you the sensitivity in the past that for every change in natural gas, $1 per MMbtu, is about $250 million per year in revenue. So, you can put it in whatever you think for natural gas on that. In terms of [what] Seifi just mentioned, we'll continue to execute on Jazan and that project is going well. And also as we've talked about, the LNG business continues to be down towards the bottom. And so we don't see a lot of change in either one of those. I would say though, just kind of all else equal and keeping natural gas where it is, maybe it's in the 33-type of range, and we were just short of that this past quarter, and for the year maybe it's something in that area. But again, I'd ask you to go back and plug in what you assume the natural gas is going be, okay?
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. That was very helpful.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Vincent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning, two quick ones. First, how much of a tailwind, if any, is your HyCO business going to see from refiners gearing up to deal with the new marine fuel regulations starting in 2020? And secondly, as you look at your pursuit of larger projects in gasification, are you going to see sort of a longer ramp-up for those projects, as they become larger in size? Are we looking at more like three to four-year ramps as opposed to two-year ramps?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I'll answer your second question and I'll have Corning answer your first question. Yes, as the projects become bigger and so on, you're right. Instead of a two-year turnaround for an ASU, it will be a four-year, five-year, that is very correct assumption. And on your first question, Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, I'm sorry to confirm for you, when you look at the crude light's blend and everything else, the split, how they run it, we don't see a huge impact for us in terms of incremental demand with the new marine regs. I think that's not going to be a huge impact.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. With that then, I think that we would like to – we have gone over the time, but no problem. I just like to thank everybody for being on the call, we do appreciate that. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. In the meantime, have a nice day and all the best to all of you. Thanks again.
Operator: Once again, that does concludes today's call. We appreciate your participation.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products & Chemicals' First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2017 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release. As you know, on October 01, 2016 Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials, as Versum Materials, and on January 03, 2017, Air Products completed the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q1 results, prior period comparisons and forward guidance we are sharing today, are based on Air Products continuing operations. In other words, they don’t include the discontinued operations of EMD or PMD. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter of strong safety and financial results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on executing our strategic Five-Point Plan. For the quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.47, up 9% over last year and in the top half of our guidance range for the quarter. And we had excellent safety performance. Now, please turn to slide number three, I am incredibly proud of our team for operating whole quarter, about 8 million man-hours without a single employee loss time accident. Considering that we have 16,000 employees working around the globe in a variety of operating environments, a last time accident rate of zero is outstanding. This performance is the best indicator that all of our people are focused, disciplined, engaged and aware of the highest standards of performance required in Air Products. We did all work hard to strive for this performance in the months and years to come. I want to thank every one of our Air Products employees for their focus, attention and discipline. Now, please turn to a slide number four, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the Company. We are determined to continue to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Now please turn to a slide number five, here you can see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long-term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our Company, or growth rates. In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash on hand and the effective deployment of that cash is one of the most important responsibilities that I have as a CEO of the Company. Now, please turn to slide number six, our Five-Point Plan that we announced 2.5 years ago. I want to take a moment and expand on the first point, our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2014, we announced that our strategic goal is to focus on our core industrial gases business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to a spin-off Material Technologies and set September 2016 as the target date to get the job done. I'm very pleased that as a result for an excellent effort by many people in Air Products and especially the people in our former Material Technologies business, we successfully got the job done in correlations with our plan in two steps. Step one was to a spin-off tax free to our shareholders, our electronics material division as a new company, called Versum Materials, which is we successfully have started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on October 03, 2016. Step two was to sell our performance material division to Evonik. The transaction was announced in May 2016, and we closed and received $3.8 billion of cash earlier this month. As a result of these actions completing the first step of our strategic plan, we now have more than $3 billion of cash that we can deploy to make acquisitions to profitably grow our core Industrial Gases business. Talking about growth, I think this an appropriate time to draw your attention to the fact that we have made announcements on January 08th and again on January 20th, that we have made the preliminary non-binding indication of interest to acquire Yingde Gases, a Hong Kong listed company and a major industrial gas company in China. We seek to engage in a friendly transaction with the company, which we believe would be very beneficial to the employees, customers and shareholders of both companies. As you may know Air Products currently has a business in China with about $1 billion of sales and more than 2,500 employees. And we are very successful operating in that country. Now, please turn to slide number seven, where you can see our three key metrics. As you can note, our metrics moved as a result of the spin off and sale of PMD, but we remain committed to our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward. Now, please go to slide number eight, which obviously is my favorite slide where you can see our quarterly progress. As you can note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by almost 1,000 basis points in the last 2.5 years. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss our results in detail. Then I’ll come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be more than pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much Seifi. Now, please turn to slide nine for a more detailed review of our Q1 results. Sales of $1.9 billion increased 1% versus last year, as higher volumes and higher energy pass-through more than offset an unfavorable currency impact of 3%. Volumes were 2% higher, primarily due to strength in Industrial Gases Asia and continued progress on our Jazan project. This was somewhat offset by the expected weakness in L&G, and our other sales equipment businesses, which we mentioned last quarter related to our FY17 guidance. In other areas, volumes were lower in Gases Americas and EMEA. Corning will provide more color shortly. Pricing remains largely unchanged across our businesses. We delivered operating leverage again this quarter, as EBITDA of $652 million improved by 3% and operating income of $408 million improved by 6%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 21.7%, improved by 80 and 110 basis points respectively as we continue to executive on our Five-Point plan. Higher energy pass-through reduced operating margins by 30 basis points. Operating margin was up 140 basis points, excluding the impact of higher energy pass-through. Versus prior year, net income increased 10% and adjusted earnings per share grew by 9%, ROCE of 12.7% improved by 180 basis points versus last year. Now, please turn to slide 10. You’ve heard Seifi and talk about our focus on cash flow. Our free cash flow was $103 million this quarter, down $19 million versus last year despite the higher EBITDA, due to the higher maintenance CapEx and higher cash taxes based on timing. Turning to slide 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance, I would like to spend the moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.32 per share or about $80 million pre-tax. We saw Materials Technologies business separation cost of $30 million or $0.12 per share for legal and advisory fees. As you remember, during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we made the decision to exit our Energy-from-Waste business and moved it into discontinued operations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we determined it was unlikely that a buyer would assume the remaining assets or contract obligations at the site. As a result, this quarter, we recorded an impairment charge in continuing operations of $50 million or $0.19 per share for air separation unit in our EMEA segment, which was intended to provide oxygen to the Energy-from-Waste plants. Additionally, in discontinued operations, which is where we report results for the Energy-from-Waste business, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $60 million, primarily associated with a land lease to the Energy-from-Waste assets. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement costs continue through next year. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in an appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.47 increased $0.12 per share or 9% versus last year. Volumes decreased EPS by $0.07 per share, primarily due to lower activity in our LNG business. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, decreased EPS by a penny. Net cost performance was $0.19 per share, favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions. Other income and expense on the consolidated P&L is about $20 million higher than last year. Compared to the FY16 quarterly average, OIE is up about $10 million. This is mainly due to the accounting for Transitioned Service Agreements of TSAs, where we are billing Versum and we will also be billing Evonik next quarter through various services, which Air Products continues to provide to both companies. The expenses we incurred are primarily in SG&A. What we billed to recover these expenses gets recorded in OIE. For the quarter, currency was $0.03 per share, unfavorable. Equity affiliate income increased by $0.02 due to better results in Italy and Asia. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest. And our lower tax rate increased earnings by $0.06 versus last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 21.2%, about 350 basis points lower than recent quarter, for three main reasons. First, our underlying rate improved by about 50 basis points, as a result of separating the MT business. Second, we adopted a new accounting standard for share-based compensation that result in about 150 basis points reduction this quarter. This benefit will vary quarter-to-quarter, and we expect it will be smaller for the rest of the year. And finally, this quarter’s rate benefitted from some favorable onetime adjustments, including foreign tax law changes worth about 150 basis points. We expect the rate for fiscal year 2017 to be about 23%. Turning to slide 12, I'd like to make a few comments on our 31 December balance sheet, and subsequent changes as shown on the pro forma column. Cash on the balance sheet as of 31 December decreased by approximately $700 million versus 30 September to a balance of $600 million, as a result of the utilizing the cash from Versum spin-off to repay commercial paper. The current or pro forma cash balance, after receiving PMD sales proceeds of $3.8 billion, is approximately $4.4 billion. We are currently investing the PMD proceeds in short-term deposits at approximately 1%. Over the next few quarters, we will pay about $1 billion in taxes associated with the significant gain on the PMD sale. Total debt of $4.3 billion as of 31 December is down approximately $1.4 billion from 30 June, which is prior to the spin and the sale. As we have said, our goal is to manage our debt balance to maintain our A, A2 credit rating, and we believe that our 31 December debt balance of $4.3 billion meets that requirement. As you may have seen, in January, S&P upgraded our business risk profile from strong to excellent due to our portfolio transformation to focus on the core industrial gas business, and also our significant EBITDA margin improvement. So, after we pay taxes on the PMD sale and keep about $300 million to operate the business, you can see that we have about $3 billion to invest in our core industrial gas business. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I’ll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning Painter: Thanks, Scott. Our industrial gas business began 2017 with another solid quarter, despite the challenging external environment with tepid economic growth and currency headwinds, our unwavering focus on productivity drove margins up in EMEA and the Americas, while in Asia, we grew China retail sales by double-digits. I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control, most importantly safety but also serving our customers well and delivering solid business results. Next, I’d like to share another example of the productivity actions we are taking to drive our business improvement. We recently completed a program to uniquely tag each of our packaged gas cylinders in nearly every country in which we operate. Knowing the exact location of each individual cylinder, allows us to run our cylinder fill and distribution systems much more efficiently. We’ve also found that it enables us to better protect our assets from being refilled by unauthorized third-party. Now, please turn to slide 13 for a review of our Gases Americas results. Our continued focus on taking the lead productivity actions enabled us to modestly improve margins despite weak volumes and the headwind from higher energy pass-through from increased natural gases prices. Sales of $864 million were up 3% versus last year as 2% lower volumes were more than offset by 5% higher energy pass-through, while pricing was flat. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, primarily on packaged gases and welding consumables. This lowered overall Americas’ volumes by 1%. North America volumes also impacted overall Americas’ volumes by 1%, as helium and steel weakness offset slightly positive LOX/LIN volumes. HyCO volumes were modestly positive as the volume contribution from our new plant in Canada was mostly offset by customer and plant maintenance outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Sequential volumes were impacted by HyCO outages and lower seasonal LOX-LIN demand. Operating income of $224 million was up 6% and EBITDA of $350 million was up 5% versus last year as the benefits from our taking the lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.9% was up 60 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.5% was up 40 basis points. Higher energy pass-through reduced the operating margin by about 90 basis points, mean that the underlying operating margin was up 150 basis points, excluding energy pass-through. Now, please turn to slide 14. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver margined expansion despite volume weakness and headwinds from currency. Versus last year, sales of $400 million were down 9% on 2% lower volumes, flat pricing, a negative 1% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily the British pound. Liquid volumes while packaged gas volumes, on a cylinders per work day basis, were up slightly. But with less work days this year, volumes were down overall. Other than the continued currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote had much impact on our business this quarter. Operating income of $88 million and EBITDA of $140 million were both down 5%, but both would have been up slightly on a constant currency basis as our productivity actions more than offset the impact from lower volumes and higher electricity tariff rates. We are working to recover the impact of the higher electrical costs in our liquid bulk business. Operating margin of 22% was up 100 basis points and EBITDA margin of 35% was up 160 basis points, driven by productivity. Sequentially, profits were impacted by currency, the higher electrical costs and volumes. Now, please turn to slide 15, Gases-Asia, where you can see the ramp-up of our new plants and the strength in our merchant business continued to deliver growth. Sales of $438 million were up 6% as volume growth of 10% was partially offset 1% on price and 3% on currency. Just over half of the volume increase was from new plants, primarily an increase primarily an increase in utility cost pass-through. Our merchant business was up mid single-digits across Asia and our China retail LOX/LIN business was again up double digits as we've improved the quality of this business. Overall, merchant pricing was down slightly, primarily due to helium as overall Asia LOX/LIN pricing and China LOX/LIN pricing were both positive. We've seen improvement in the China LOX/LIN plant loadings, in fact we're essentially sold-out for certain products in some regions of China. But overall, industry overcapacity still remains. Operating income of $118 million was up 1% and EBITDA of $178 million was down 1%. Profits were flat as the utility pass-through is, by definition, at zero margin and we had headwinds from currency, and about $5 million of positive non-recurring items a year-ago. Operating margin of 26.9% was down 140 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.7 was down 290 basis points versus last year, driven mainly by the increase in utility cost pass-through. Sequentially, margins rebounded on lower costs. Finally, earlier this month, we announced the next phase of our gas complex in Pyeongtaek City, South Korea. We are building a second plant to support our customer’s semi-conductor fab business. This builds on the major project we announced at the same sight in 2015. I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business, as well as costs associated with industrial gas business, which are not region specific. Sales were up, versus prior year, driven by progress on the Jazan ASU, sale of equipment project this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Segment profits were up versus prior year, as we continue to recognize profit on the Jazan project. You'll recall that we had a catch-up profit booking last quarter, which is why profits are down sequentially. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for comment on our corporate segment.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Corning. Our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses, as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales and profits were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity. As we have said, the lack of customer decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business and we still expect at least $0.25 headwind in LNG for FY17 versus FY16. We did see a positive impact from our productivity actions. Now, please turn to slide 16, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you again, Simon. Before we take any questions, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook. Please turn to slide number 16. As we move forward, I want to report to our shareholders that Air Products is in a very strong position. In the past 2.5 years, we have totally reorganized the Company in accordance with our Five-Point plan. We have implemented meaningful productivity plans, resulting in 1,000 basis improvement in our margins. We have put in place a very robust and effective regionally focused organization with highly qualified managers in place. Our safety performance has vastly improved an indication that they have the engagement and participation of all of our 16,000 employees. The productivity programs we have implemented and the new ones under way will continue to drive our earnings per share as they have done in the past 10 quarters. In addition, we have focused our portfolio on our core Industrial Gases business, and as a result of the divestment of non-core assets, we now have an excellent balance sheet, which is, by far, the best in the industry. Reflecting our financial strength, this morning, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.09 or 10% to $0.95 per share per quarter for the dividend payable in May. We have never had a larger cent per share dividend increase. We remain confident in the tremendous growth opportunities to invest in our core business, which is Industrial Gases, and our strong financial position allows us to also reward our shareholders directly through dividend increase and profit acquisitions. So, in short, we are confident about the steps of our Company, but we are a global Company with only 40% of our sales in United States. We do not manufacture products in the U.S. that are exported to other parts of the world. We also do not manufacture products in the rest of the world that are imported into United States. Our business is local to where our customers are around the world. Therefore, like any other global company, we are not immune to macroeconomic or geopolitical events that can impact our business. The new administration in United States has not yet articulated its full economic portfolio and policy. In Europe, six months after the referendum, it remains unclear how the UK government will address the exit from the European Union. Is it a soft Brexit, hard Brexit or Brexit at all now that the UK Parliaments has to vote on the issue. In addition, it is impossible to predict how other countries will react to the new economic and political developments in the United States and Europe. All of these events can have significant impact on the level of economic activity and the exchange rates in the areas we operating in. As a result, we are now more cautious in our outlook. Our guidance for the full year 2017 EPS is $6 to $6.25 per share, which at midpoint, is an increase of 9% over last year; one of the most bullish predictions than any other industrial gas or chemical companies that I have heard of. Our guidance for EPS in the second quarter of fiscal ’17, that is next quarter, is $1.30 to $1.40 per share. At this time, I do want to once again thank all of our employees at Air Products for our excellent safety and financial performance in the first quarter. Our entire team is focused on delivering industry leading performance as we move forward. Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instruction]. And we’ll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
Katherine Griffin: This is Katherine Griffin on for David. Maybe first could we just talk about the drivers of the lower guidance, and what you guys are expecting?
Seifi Ghasemi: Drivers of the lower guidance…
Katherine Griffin: Yes.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, people keep talking about lower guidance. I just want to stress, our guidance is 6% to 11% increase versus last year. So, I mean the stress on the lower kind of is interesting for me. But in terms of why did we take our guidance down, there are four key elements. Number one our base for last year ended up to $0.10 lower than what we thought and we closed our books at the end of September. If you recall, we said it was going to be partial and before. We have reported this public within the beginning of January it is 564, so that is $0.10. Our LNG business is doing worse than we thought because we haven't had any orders for our LNG that is $0.05 more negative. Our volumes, we are being cautious and that will affect us about $0.05. We might be wrong on that but that is what we are forecasting right now. And then the currency is about $0.05 worse. So that adds up-to about $0.25 that is the difference between our guidance today versus it was at the end of October.
Katherine Griffin: And talking about the Chinese industrial gas market in terms of on-site merchant and packaged business, could you just talk about how you are -- what you are seeing in that competitive landscape?
Seifi Ghasemi: You mean about business in China in general, or about…
Katherine Griffin: Yes, in general.
Seifi Ghasemi: I would like to turn that over to Corning, to kind of expand on that.
Corning Painter: So Katherine I am going to focus mainly on on-sites and liquid bulk. The participation of ourselves and other majors in packaged gases there is a bit small. So, on the on sight basis, it's relatively stable and we see the step changes as new plants come on. Bidding activity is -- we’re in discussion with people and that sort of continues. The liquid bulk side, as I reported in my prepared comments that we continue to see loading of our plants, we continue to see an increase of the loading on the retail sales portion of it. So, all-in-all, I think that’s speaks to despite all or whatever news is out there, a fundamental momentum in the Chinese economy and certainly in our business.
Seifi Ghasemi: Does that answer your question?
Katherine Griffin: Yes, thank you very much.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Chris Parkinson: Pertaining to any potential M&A activity, you used very broadly comment on your strategic thinking updates, I imagine it's probably all of these things. But just to focus on on-site businesses, geographic diversifications, skill and density benefits, opportunistic valuations. Just any color on how you’re thinking about the evolution of your longer term portfolio, and any risks that you are or are not willing to take from an asset perspective? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: We are, in general, as we have said many times, focused on making acquisitions that will increase our percentage of on-site business. That is one of the reasons that we are pursuing the acquisition of Yingde, which is a company with almost more than 85% on-site. So that, in general, is the direction that we are going, and we do have a lot of opportunities. We had talked about asset buybacks, most of that asset buybacks are in the on-sight business. So that is a direction that we are going. In terms of geographically, we obviously are focused on areas where we think there is going to be growth. If you look to chasing growth, you have go to places where the population is growing or the standards of living is going up. Because if you don’t have those things you can talk about growth as much as you want but you are not going to get it. So, therefore, we are focused on China, which we believe has great potential. We are focused on India. We are focused on Mexico and we are focused on the Gulf Coast of United States. So, there are some opportunities in Europe and also in Russia. So, we are looking at around the world. But the emphasis is more on the on-site business, which is consistent with what we have said before.
Chris Parkinson: And generally on macro expectations, you hit on a few things in the UK. But as we’re heading further into ’17, it appears that activity in LatAm is actually picking up a little bit. Europe's mix, but on the whole moving in the right direction, I suppose. Just given that some major elections coming up, just how are you thinking about general macro and also the willingness of growth in business investments? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: In Europe.
Chris Parkinson: In Europe and in Latin America, as well. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, LatAm -- so let me try to take that in America first. Latin America is weak. We at least are seeing some weakness in Chile. We continue to see weakness in Brazil at least for our own business. So, that is -- we are talking about Latin America, excluding Mexico. Then, with respect to Europe, up to now we have not seen any significant changes. Our business is moving along in kind of a stable way. It's nothing to write home about, but at the same time it is not following the product, so it's kind of a steady thing. The risk in Europe for us is if there is a major shift in currency exchange rates, which is not obviously -- it's just translation, but it could have an effect on the EPS that we report.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with J. P. Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Your price raw materials variance was negative in the quarter. Can you talk about pricing in the different geographic areas, and whether you expect this variance to improve in the course of the year?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think we have a detailed explanation. But I'll ask Corning to address that.
Corning Painter: Probably the most exciting region for us in terms of, let's say on the cost side if you are thinking about margin, was definitely in Europe. And in Europe, typically, France is a net exporter of attractively priced nuclear power and had a number of power stations down at one point I think around 40. And that's really disrupted the power market on the Continent. So, that's been a challenge for us. We’re working to recover that in our business, and that gets an opportunity for this going forward.
Seifi Ghasemi: Does that answer your question, Jeff?
Jeff Zekauskas: Can you also talk about industrial gas pricing in the United States? And how you think that trend might change in the course of the year?
Corning Painter: Yes, so pricing in the U.S. somewhat impacted right now, I'd say one of the biggest movers for us is the overall helium in market. And that we continued, I think have gone through a period where we have over-supply and the world is working its way through that. I think looking forward on pricing I'd rather not make too many forward statements in that department. But I think the helium is one very much driven by supply and demand as that gets absorbed and in the U.S. DLM to be helium facility moves towards greater maturity and ultimate closure, I think is going to be an offset to that.
Seifi Ghasemi: Does that answer your questions?
Jeff Zekauskas: Yes, thanks very much.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Chris Evans: Can you quantify any impact from stranded costs that's you felt in the quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Scott, do you want to make some comments on this?
Scott Crocco: Sure. Let me, actually, expand the question and take it through some things regarding the transition services. And I’ve made some comments in my prepared remarks, but I want to make sure I get everybody granted. First as I have mentioned, we saw an increase in our other income and expense in our P&L. It was about $0.07 favorable versus prior year. But when you look at, we all know that this moves around, there is different asset sales and so forth. When you look at the quarter compared to last year average per quarter, it's up about $10 million. This is principally driven by the TSA that we began to recognize further soon. So, what we’re going to do here is we’re going to provide services to both Versum and Evonik. Evonik will start in this quarter, and they’ll go to next 12 to 18 months or so. The expenses that we incurred and this are principally in the SG&A line, and then we’re going to offset that in other income and expense. And so, where you saw, at the beginning of that here in this quarter on a run-rate basis, should expect as we have both Evonik and Versum on, we’ll see about $40 million to $45 million per year for transition services. Once we’ve stopped providing those services, there’ll be some resources that activities will go away and then we don’t longer need those resources because those activities go away. That will play out over the next year to year and a half. And then, additionally, we have some costs in the corporate segment, which we have to focus on eliminating. So, the TSA will cover the costs in the short-term. Once those end, we’ll take the activities out. We’ll take the costs out. There will probably be, we’ve said in the past about $25 million total stranded cost that once all the activity goes away we’ll work to offset and eliminate. Okay, hopefully that helps.
Chris Evans: Absolutely. And then I guess maybe shifting gears a bit towards your M&A strategy, specifically with Yingde, it seems to be consistent with your guided directions that you’ve talked before that go for on-site, and then focus on regions like China. But if you betted that customer base, it seems to be largely focused on steel that might at risk.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, the thing is that, obviously, we have taken everything into consideration when we looked at that. But that company they have done a very good job and diversified, although their portfolio is not received. They have about 60, 70 customers and they have a lot of good customers and onsite businesses with the chemical sector. So, they have a balanced portfolio. They are not particularly exposed. And we have taken into consideration what the consequences are of the consolidation of the steel industry in China.
Chris Evans: So similar or legal or contracts, that you have in other parts of the world should we expect to that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think considering that we are in the middle of these discussions, I think, it would be a very inappropriate for me to make any comments about their contracts, or anything like that. So, you allow us to see -- do the transactions, we can go to all of that with you.
Operator: The next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Just a question on the capital structure. If you were to use the $3 billion to just go out and buying assets that has EBITDA, obviously, that’s a deleveraging effect. Even though, you were at the level at the end of the year once rating agencies that they were happy with. Is that the way you would expect it to work, or would you take on commensurate debt kind of at the same ratio that Air Products is today to keep their ratio the same through the acquisitions?
Seifi Ghasemi: Duffy that’s an excellent question, I am very happy to answer that, because I would like to expand on that. Our goal is to maintain our A ratings. Our goal is not to de-lever Air Products. So, if we have the capacity as we buy acquisitions on all of that, we obviously have the capacity to take on more debt. The key thing is that we want net debt to EBITDA to be order of magnitude about 2 to 2.2 to maintain our A rating. As you know, some of the other people in the industry have net debt to EBITDA much higher than that and they still have an A rating. So, our goal is not to stop our growth, because we just want to de-lever to having no debt. Now, we want to maintain our A rating, and whatever that implies in terms of the net debt to EBITDA, that’s what we’ll do.
Duffy Fischer: And then obviously the Yingde bid has gotten a lot of headlines. But is it just as probably that some of other deals or what shake loose this year, some of the asset buybacks, maybe in the Middle East and different places like that?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, obviously that is our intent. As you know, we have the firing power to do a lot more than just acquisition of Yingde. We have a lot of more cash. And as you said, the more EBITDA comes in you can do more. So, we have the capacity to do a lot more. And you can rest assured that we are looking at a lot of different things, and I hope that some of those materialize soon.
Operator: Next will be James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan: With respect to the Yingde discussions, could you talk about how you deal with the currency risk there, do you have a view that the currency is not going to decline further? Or how do you see yourselves mitigating any currency risk in China?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, obviously, when we -- these industrial gases, as you know, is a local business, it will cost under local and your income is in low cost. So, there is not too much of a risk, the only risk is translation. And in addition to that if we do those acquisitions, we can always borrow locally, and all of that, set ourselves from exchange rates. That’s the good thing about industrial gases, we are very local business and we do business locally.
James Sheehan: Could you also discuss how you see synergy opportunities at Yingde?
Seifi Ghasemi: As I said, since we are in the middle of this thing, I think that would be inappropriate for me to address that. I think if we ever do the deal, we obviously will make a presentation and we will give you all the details about all of our expectations.
Operator: And our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: I apologize if this has been asked; I had to hop off for a minute. But Seifi, I'm just wondering -- you referenced in the prepared remarks and in the press release the uncertainty over the -- President Trump's economic policy and so forth. But I think it's well understood that he has some issues with China. And there are all sorts of concerns out there in many different directions. So, I'm just curious what gives you the comfort to then go do a large acquisition in China, given the uncertainty surrounding economic policy and so forth.
Seifi Ghasemi: Vincent, I think what we've said and what we meant to say was that, we don’t know, we didn’t take a position positive or negative. The second thing is that Air Products has been in business for 75 years. During that time, we have had 14 different presidents, we shouldn’t and we don’t run the business on the basis of what political party is in power, because we know things change every four radius. We are looking at the long-term. China is a place that it has the population and the standard of living is going up. Those are the only things that defect economic growth. We see economic growth there for the long-term. Therefore, if we can strengthen our position and be there, I think that would be the right thing to do, and that is our strategy. There might be things in the short-term that might affect things. But we are being paid to look at, keeping Air Products afloat for another 75 years, and taking that view that would be the right place to invest.
Vincent Andrews: And just as a follow-up, Scott, I think if I heard you correctly, the electricity costs issue that hurt the quarter. These do not have a contractual ability to recoup you're going to have to try to recoup them the ordinary way. As I seem to recall a couple of years ago, there was an electricity issue I think maybe in the U.S. that you were able to recoup quite quickly. So is this a different construct?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think Corning will address that.
Corning Painter: So, for the Continental Europe, we have a variety of different contracts that are out there. There are some that are formula that takes certain period of time, there is others where we've got the ability to surcharge, and we've started that process. So it depends really customer-by-customer and contract-by-contract. But there is the ability to go get this.
Scott Crocco: Yes, Vincent, maybe just that's around our merchant business, right. And so if you’re then looking at our tonnage business, those are all under a contract with a defined formula for how they approach. And it's really not particularly material in the packaged gases space.
Seifi Ghasemi: There’s a little bit of a timing here, Vincent, as you know very well.
Operator: Next is Steve Byrne with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Steve Byrne: [Technical difficulty] production in China, would that potentially lead to a tightening of the liquid oxygen and nitrogen markets?
Seifi Ghasemi: We did not hear the first part of your question. I think there was interruption. Would you be kind enough to repeat to that please?
Steve Byrne: Sure. If there is rationalization in China of coal-based chemical production, would that potentially lead to a tightening of the liquid oxygen and nitrogen markets?
Seifi Ghasemi: I would say not very much, because a lot of these big plants get supply the coal gasification facilities do not have liquid attached.
Corning Painter: I would just add, I don’t see coal to chemical slowing down, especially the element of that using industrial gases. Coal and electricity, right, there has been an announcement, but that has nothing to do with the industrial gas market. Clean coal to chemical, I think, remains an area of emphasis in China.
Seifi Ghasemi: I just like to expand on that, because we obviously operate there and we keep track of these things. There was a headline that China has closed on 102 coal-fired power plants. That's a totally different subject than gasification for coal for production of chemicals. That is actually environmentally 10-times more friendly and the Chinese government has not slowed that down, and we don’t see any of that at all. 
Steve Byrne: And then just as a follow-up, how would you categorize the role of intellectual property in the industrial gas industry and Air Products’ overlap with global and regional peers?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, that’s obviously a very broad question. We do have intellectual property on certain products that we make in terms of applications and so on. But I would say that there isn’that -- nobody that claim that that is going to be make a material difference in terms of their performance with somebody else. We don’t see that, and this is not like intellectual property for software or anything like that. No, that wouldn’t be too much of a big deal.
Operator: Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: On the Asia gases volumes, I think this was at least the eight consecutive quarter of volume growth in high single-digits to low double-digit rates, as you ramp up the new projects. How much of your Asia sales, are now in China, and how much longer can you stay in near these high levels of this high base?
Corning Painter: So, almost $1 billion of our Asia sales are in China. In terms of the pace, there is two elements of what you see reported right now, some of that is associated with new plants and largely utility pass-through, and that’s going to turn a little bit as our customers progressed in starting up their own facilities. In terms of the merchant market, well of course, that’s subject to economic overall conditions. But you can see we have positive momentum there, I think most importantly positive around retail sales.
John Roberts: And then secondly, if the LNG outlook remained suppressed, could that operation become non-core? Or because its cryogenic gas equipment in engineering, would it still be due to its core in most scenarios?
Seifi Ghasemi: LNG is core business for us for sure, because there is no question that LNG will come back. Any kind of the projection that you look at for the long-term LNG will come back and that in particular is an area where we do have intellectual property. We are going to keep our LNG business for the long-term. We are going to suffer for a two years, but that is the nature of the business. LNG is core to Air Products, we always said that.
Operator: And next will be Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Seifi, I do wanted to follow-up on the capital deployment dialogue in response to an earlier question, I think you called out Mexico is a country of interest as it relates to growth along with China, India and the U.S. Gulf. Just wondering if you see any opportunity to increase your stake at infra over the next year or two? And then second piece, have you had an opportunity or is there any interest on the part of the Air Products to explore acquisition of any assets that might be casted-off from a potential combination between Praxair and Linde? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: The reason that we mentioned Mexico is because there is -- Mexico is a country which has significant oil and gas resources. And we see a lot of opportunities there for us in terms of hydrogen, nitrogen, and all that kind of stuff related to the oil industry. The second thing is obviously the country has a depopulation there is a lot of opportunities there. In terms of increasing our shares in core infra, we have very good partners there, we will fit them. Obviously, we always have the ambition of being having a situation that we can consolidate that acquisition. But that is the -- it depends on our partners. We have a very good relationship with them. But if they ever would want us to increase our share, we will be more than happy to do that.
Kevin McCarthy: Any thoughts on Praxair/Linde casted-off assets?
Seifi Ghasemi: I know you are asking me that, and I don’t want to go there because I don’t want to make any comments about that acquisition. Things might or might now become available, so I just want to stay away from that. If they do obviously, it would be interesting.
Kevin McCarthy: And as a follow-up, if I may on your corporate line, recognizing the dearth of LNG orders. Can you perhaps provide an outlook for run rate there for the balance of the fiscal year, please?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think the run rate there is going to be nothing to write home about, to be perfectly honest, I mean, because LNG, as I said, it is a core business for us. But the decrease in which that product or that performance has come down was a surprise because we didn’t think that everybody will stop everybody, and this is what they have done.
Operator: The next question is from Nils Wallin with CLSA Brokerage.
Nils Wallin: I was hoping to drill down a little bit more on your volume guidance and the $0.05 headwind. Would you tease-out perhaps where you are seeing the greater weakness than you had a quarter ago? I was a little bit surprised given your on-site exposure. Was there any sort of expectation that volumes there might also come down?
Seifi Ghasemi: The reason that we are making a comment on the volume is that the main area we are concerned is in Europe, because of the Brexit. That one -- I mean, it hasn’t had significant affect. People say that why are you worried about that, it hasn’t had any significant effect on your business. Of course, it hasn’t had any significant business, because nothing has been done, like it's going on. I mean, UK hasn’t even announced that they are going to a Brexit and they haven't kind of invoked Article 50 yet. What we are concerned about when they actually do that and they do give notice, how would the markets react? So that is what we are being cautious about.
Nils Wallin: And then just on Yingde, I know that there's been a lot of discussion around the growth in China. Obviously, it looks like a cheap asset. But is there anything else strategically that you are seeing? Clearly, they were not builders of their own assets. Is there operational opportunities that you believe are available there?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, obviously since they are not building their own asset that would be a great thing for us. Because then the next plant and the next plant that they would win will be built by Air Products. So, we see significant opportunity there. And they are a good company. We have a lot of respect for their people. They have very good people, and we think that the combination of them and the Air Products, will be very good for the employees. It will be good for our customers, because -- and it will give us better position in China. So, there is a lot of positives there.
Nils Wallin: Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. And we are on top of the hour, so we will take one more question and then we end the call. One more question please.
Operator: And the next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: Seifi, I know the chart on slide eight is your favorite, but it could lead some observers to conclude that maybe margins have plateaued here. I know that there is some natural gas impact in there that would make the margin better, and it's obviously been a very challenging environment. But how confident are you that you can get the Company back to a positive margin trajectory in what you see as a challenging demand environment going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Our goal is that, in that chart, is that we will have a margin which is higher than anybody else. I think at 35% EBITDA margin, I have never made a statement that there is lot more room to go. Our goal was to be higher than other people, and which we are. So, we are not forecasting that that margin will significantly improve. All of the productivity programs that we have will go on maintaining that margin, because our costs are going up. But we have never projected that the business has the potential of having much higher margin than that. But if anybody else’s margin goes to 40%, I guarantee you that we will be choosing for 41%. But quite frankly, I don’t see a lot of upside on that margin.
Mike Harrison: And then I was also hoping that you could comment on your Indura business down in Chile. You’ve mentioned that it was mostly packaged and hard-goods that was driving the weakness down there. Are we still looking at a business that's primarily packaged gases? Or have you been successful in expanding the amount of merchant and on-site business in Chile?
Seifi Ghasemi: Our business in Indura is challenging, because it is mostly packaged gases business and there is not a lot of opportunities to turn that around and have a lot of on-sites because there is not a lot of on-site opportunities in Chile. So, we do have an issue there. Since Corning is responsible for that, I like him to make some comments on that.
Corning Painter: Yes, so maybe just to broader picture on the whole South American situation. So, keep in mind when we look at our volumes and how they might compare. First of all, it’s a clean quarter for us. We had no substantial new plants coming on in this timeframe. And also we're much more focused on Linde on Chile. But we also have Columbia and our business in Brazil is there for us as well. We are primarily packaged gases. Packaged gases has been impacted more, maybe just for what it's worth, our liquid bulk volumes in South America are positive for us in this quarter. So, it's not like we’re without momentum in that space.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Mike, anything else?
Mike Harrison: That's it. Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well,£ thank you very much. Then with that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call today. Again, thanks for taking time from your very busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the best. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products & Chemicals' Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter 2016 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and in today's earnings release. As you know, on October 1, Air Products completed the spin-off of Electronic Materials as Versum Materials, and we continue to make progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik. The Q4 and FY 2016 full-year results we are sharing today include both EMD and PMD in continuing operations. Our guidance for Q1 and FY 2017 does not include EMD and we have provided forward guidance both with and without the PMD business. You will see that we also provided an estimate of the comparable prior-year quarter and full-year Air Products results. We continue to evaluate the progress of the PMD sale to determine when we will report PMD in discontinued operations. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another quarter and another year of excellent results. Despite the sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on executing our strategic Five-Point Plan. For the year, we delivered what we had promised you a year-ago. We had earnings per share of $7.55, which is up 14% over last year and $0.05 higher than the top end of the initial guidance range we provided you last October. As for the quarter, we delivered record earnings per share of $2.01, which is up $0.10 over last year and it is the ninth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings per share growth. I think it's important to know that we have been consistent. For the year, we also improved our margins by 400 basis points and our return on capital employed increased 180 basis points to 13.8%. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to continue to be the best in the industry. Now, please turn to slide number 3. Our safety performance for the year showed improvement over last year, that's good news. However, I do believe that the only acceptable goal for us is zero accidents and incidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injury or incident. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of everyone. Now, please turn to slide number 4, which is the reconfirmation of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Now, please turn to slide number 5. Here, you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long-term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products has a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company. Now, please turn to slide number 6, our Five-Point Plan that we announced two years ago. Our strong performance is a direct result of our focus on executing this Plan. The first point of Plan is our focus on Industrial Gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to a spinoff our Material Technologies business, and we said that we expected to complete that spinoff by end of fiscal year 2016, which was the end of September of this year. Although we changed the scope of this spinoff earlier this year, I'm very pleased to say that many people at Air Products worked very hard to make this happen, and now Versum is a successful, a stand-alone company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange as of October 1. We continue to make progress on the sale of our performance additive materials (sic) [Performance Materials] to Evonik and consistent with what we have said before we are still targeting to close this transaction before the end of this calendar year. I truly believe this is excellent for the employees of the three companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business and will grow in the future. PMD employees will be core to a world-class material company at Evonik and Versum Materials employees are now an independent best-in-class electronic materials company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe these actions will also create shareholder value in the long-term. We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our Plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. Our robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means that we have visibility and control to ensure that we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years. I am very optimistic about the growth potential for our core Industrial Gases businesses, especially opportunities in the large oxygen and hydrogen plants. Now, please turn to slide number 7. There you can see the result of this quarter and the fiscal year for our three key metrics. Once again, for the third consecutive quarter, we are proud to have achieved our goal to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these three metrics. We remain focused on driving further improvement as we move forward. Now, please turn to slide number 8. Here you can see a summary of our performance for the year. Scott will go through the details but I just want to point out that despite lower sales due to lower energy and currency, we improved EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points, increased EPS by 14%, and return on capital employed is up 180 basis points to 13.8%. The operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefit of restructuring actions we took last year enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwinds. Now, please turn to slide number 9, my favorite slide, where you can see our quarterly progress. As you will note, we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years. On slide number 10, you can see several of our fiscal year accomplishments. The worldwide team at Air Products delivered strong financial results while staying focused on bringing very large projects on-stream successfully, winning new projects, spinning off Versum Materials, and working towards closing the sale of PMD to Evonik. A great example of commitment and focused effort of the people at Air Products. Once again, I thank all of them for their contributions. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss our results in detail. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2016 results before discussing our fourth quarter. Please turn to slide 11. In summary for the year productivity drove significant profit growth despite modest volume growth and currency headwinds. Total sales declined 4%, driven by unfavorable currency and energy pass-through impacts of 3% each while underlying sales increased by 2% driven by higher volumes in Gases-Asia and our Jazan sale of equipment project in Saudi Arabia. Operating income increased 16%; operating margin was up 400 basis points to 23.1%; and EBITDA margin was up 420 basis points to 34.4%, driven primarily by better cost performance. Only 50 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through. Diluted EPS increased by 14% and our return on capital employed improved by 180 basis points to 13.8%. On slide 12, we show you our distributable cash flow of more than $11 per share. We believe this measure more than EPS is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance in FY 2016, our distributable cash flow increased by $200 million or 9%. This, combined with lower growth capital spending in FY 2016 generated free cash flow of over $900 million, which is up $500 million over last year. Now please turn to slide 13 to review our full year EPS. Year-on-year EPS growth of $0.95, or 14%, was driven primarily by lower cost and improved pricing net of raw material costs. Volume growth in Gases-Asia was largely offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. And in our sale of equipment businesses, higher Jazan project revenue was more than offset by lower activity in LNG and our other sale of equipment businesses. Price mix improvement of $0.29 was delivered by Gases-Americas, Gases-Europe, and Materials Technologies. And cost contributed $0.94 as focused productivity actions in all our segments more than offset inflation. This was more than enough to overcome unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of $0.16 and $0.11 unfavorable from items below operating income detailed on the slide. Now please turn to slide 14 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.5 billion increased 1% versus last year as higher volumes more than offset lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 1% each. Volumes were 3% higher primarily due to continued progress on our Jazan project. Somewhat offsetting Jazan is softness in LNG and in other sale of equipment businesses as existing projects are completed while less new projects are added to the backlog. In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in Gases-Asia, but were offset by economic weakness in Latin America and Europe. Materials Technologies volumes rebounded nicely this quarter. Pricing was largely unchanged versus prior year. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $855 million improved by 9% and operating income of $584 million improved by 13%. EBITDA margin of 34.7% and operating margin of 23.7% improved by 250 basis points and 260 basis points respectively as we continue to execute on our Five-Point Plan. All three regional industrial gas segments and Materials Technologies improved margins again this quarter. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 20 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Versus prior year, net income increased by 11% and earnings per share grew 10%. Now, please turn to slide 15. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow. So we were pleased to see that our free cash flow was $264 million this quarter, up $138 million versus last year due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx. Turning to slide 16, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that total $0.17 per share or $44 million pre-tax. We saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $23 million for legal and advisory fees and tax cost. And we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $7 million as part of our debt for debt exchange to facilitate the Versum spin-off. Also included this quarter is $14 million for position eliminations and pension settlement costs. We expect to see cost action and pension settlement costs continue through next year. Further actions will be part of a second $300 million of operational improvements and other actions to offset stranded cost from our decision to divest Materials Technologies. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in an appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $2.01 increased $0.18 per share or 10% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.06 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.03. Net cost performance was $0.13 favorable, primarily driven by our productivity actions. Currency translation and foreign exchange gains combined was $0.02 favorable as currency translation impacts were $0.03 unfavorable and foreign exchange losses from the prior-year of $0.05 did not repeat. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to lower capitalized interest and a higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.02. And finally I'd like to make a few comments on our 30 September balance sheet. As you know, as part of the Versum spin, approximately $1 billion of debt was raised by Versum, which was then paid out to Air Products. This payment came in the form of $550 million in cash and was equal to the Versum tax basis and approximately $425 million as part of the debt to debt exchange, which we used to retire commercial paper. This all occurred as planned prior to the end of September. The net effect of these transactions is that Air Products has $550 million more cash and approximately $425 million less debt as of September 30. However, since Versum debt was issued in September, but Versum did not become a separate entity until October 1, Air Products consolidated balance sheet includes the Versum debt. As you can see in total, cash is up about $1 billion relative to June 30 in part due to Versum and also due to cash generation from our business including Jazan. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Fiscal 2016 was another very strong year for the Industrial Gas business and I would like to thank the entire team around the world for staying focused on the things we control and in particular, for exceeding our productivity goals. On slide 17, you can see the significant EBITDA margin improvement that we delivered in each of our three regional businesses in 2016, up over 600 basis points in Americas, up over 500 basis points in EMEA and up over 250 basis points in Asia. This strong performance was delivered in a challenging external environment with weak economic conditions and currency headwinds. We stay focused on safety and deliver the benefits from our Taking the Lead productivity program. As you know, our business is inherently local. That is why we moved to a regional structure and incentive plan two years ago. Every employee, every distribution truck, every plant matters. The opportunity to improve our network design touches on all three of these. For example, we recently announced the start up of a new liquid plant in Carrington, UK. This plant is not just more efficient than the old plant, it's sized to allow us to consolidate all Northwest England liquid bulk operations in Carrington and close a second older liquefier that was just 35 miles away. We have made great progress and are even more confident about our ability to deliver future benefits. We're also excited to continue our success in winning new projects. We announced a project in the U.S. and one in South Korea within the last two weeks. Now, please turn to slide 18 for a review of our Gases Americas fourth quarter results. Our profit growth and significant margin expansion was driven by our Taking the Lead productivity efforts across all sub-regions. Sales of $877 million were down 3% versus last year on lower volumes. Latin American volumes were down close to 10%, which lowered overall Americas volumes by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid bulk businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. North America volumes were lowered overall – lowered overall Americas volumes by 1%, primarily due to a weakness in steel. Sequential volumes were impacted by planned customer maintenance outages. Pricing, energy pass-through and currency were all flat versus prior year. We did see a sequential increase in energy pass-through revenue as natural gas prices increased. Operating income of $225 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $352 million was up 7% versus last year as the benefits of our Taking the Lead operational improvements more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes. Operating margin of 25.6% was up 250 basis points and EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 350 basis points. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher natural gas prices and lower volumes. And as I mentioned, we are excited to have signed an agreement with The Chemours Company to supply multiple industrial gases to their titanium dioxide production facility in New Johnsonville, Tennessee. We will build a new plant expected on stream in the fall 2018 that will supply Chemours and also produce additional liquid argon to serve the northern and central regions of the United States. Now, please turn to slide 19. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa business, the team continues to deliver strong profit growth despite continued volume weakness and currency headwinds. Versus last year, sales of $414 million were down 10% on 4% lower volumes, a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 3% impact from currency. The liquid volumes were down in all four sub-regions with more than half of the decline due to lower wholesale volumes. Packaged gases demand was down broadly. Other than the obvious currency impact, we don't believe the Brexit vote has had much impact on our business this quarter. Operating income of $98 million was up 8% and EBITDA of $154 million was up 2% as our productivity actions more than offset the currency headwinds. Operating margin of 23.7% and EBITDA margin of 37.2% were both up over 400 basis points. Lower energy pass-through improved operating margin by about 70 points meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 330 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through. Please turn to slide 20, Gases-Asia. Volume growth continues from new plants and our base business, while our productivity actions enhance our profitability. Sales of $449 million were up 5% as volume growth of 7% was partially offset by a negative 2% currency impact. Roughly two-thirds of the volume increase was from new plants including an increase in energy pass-through revenue. Our merchant business was up mid single digits across Asia, and our China retail LOX/LIN business was again up double digits, as we've improved the quality of this business. Despite continuing price pressure in helium there are signs of improvement in the China LOX/LIN business, but we still expect the overcapacity to remain for some time. Operating income of $110 million was up 5% and EBITDA of $172 million was up 4%. The profit growth was slightly muted, as we had a positive on-site customer catch-up payment last year. The increase in energy pass-through revenue is at no margin, and we had headwinds from currency and incentive compensation. Our productivity programs continue to deliver. Operating margin of 24.5% and EBITDA margin of 38.2% were roughly flat versus last year. Sequentially, margins were impacted by higher incentive compensation and higher seasonal power costs. Finally, we just announced earlier this week, a new air separation unit in Ulsan, South Korea to support pipeline and merchant demand growth. We have been serving customers in the region for nearly 30 years and look forward to continuing our excellent track record. I'll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with the industrial gas business that are not region specific. Sales were up, as we recognized over $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASUs sale of equipment this quarter, which more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASUs. Segment profits were up as we recognized profit on the Jazan profit. The profit this quarter includes a cumulative catch up related to project activity during the full year. We do expect to book revenue and profit for Jazan in FY 2017. Now please turn to slide 21. And I'll turn the call over to Simon for a comment on our other business results.
Simon R. Moore - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, Corning. As I mentioned earlier, we completed the spin-off of our Electronic Materials business as Versum Materials on October 1 and are making progress on the sale of our Performance Materials business to Evonik. Both of these businesses are included in Air Products continuing operations for Q4 2016. On slide 21, you can see that Materials Technologies, which includes both EMD and PMD continued to show strong results with sales, volumes, profits and margins all up versus last year. Please turn to slide 22 for the EMD results as reported within Air Products. I will make some brief comments and the Versum Materials team will address their results in more detail when they hold their earnings call. Sales of $248 million were up 7% on 7% higher volumes driven by strength in Advanced Materials and Delivery Systems. EBITDA of $83 million was up 5% and operating income of $70 million was up 11% versus last year. Now please turn to slide 23 for a review of our PMD results. Sales of $267 million were up 4% on 8% higher volumes partially offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by polyurethane additive strength in spray, appliance and construction markets as well as epoxy strength in coatings and non-residential construction markets. Specialty additives volumes were flat as stronger coatings volumes offset weakness due to the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil. Overall prices were down given broader petrochemical driven deflation but this was more than offset by lower raw material costs. EBITDA of $74 million was up 29% and EBITDA margin of 27.8% was up 550 basis points. Operating income of $68 million was up 35%, and operating margin of 25.3% was up 580 basis points, primarily driven by productivity and favorable price/raw material balance. Finally, our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which were not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on significantly lower LNG project activity and profits were down as the impact from the lower sales more than offset lower costs. As we've said the lack of customers' decisions on new LNG projects is having a significant impact on our business, about a $0.10 headwind for FY 2016. We expect a further, approximately $0.25 headwind in FY 2017 versus FY 2016. Now please turn to slide 24, and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi for a discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you again, Simon. The Air Products team remains focused on implementing our Five-Point Strategic Plan to move us forward as the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. As you can see, we are providing guidance for first quarter and for fiscal year 2017 on two bases, one is with our PMD business and the second is without the PMD business. As I said before, nothing has changed. We continue to make progress on the sale of PMD and we are still targeting to close before the end of this calendar year. However, since we are still going through the regulatory approval process, PMD is not currently in discontinued operations. Therefore, we are providing guidance both including and excluding PMD. You can see that we have also provided an estimate for continuing operation EPS result for quarter one fiscal 2016 and total fiscal year 2016, so that you can compare our next year to what we actually achieved last year. On the basis that excludes the PMD business, which is our core industrial gas business, our guidance for fiscal year 2017 is for earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.50, up 9% to 13% over last year. And also on the basis that excludes PMD, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, our guidance is for earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, up 3% to 10% over last year. We expect our CapEx, excluding any significant acquisition, to be about $1.2 billion. Our EPS guidance is consistent with this CapEx guidance. In other words, it does not include any acquisitions. And while things could always change, our guidance also does not include any positive effect from share repurchase. I would like to stress these points again. Our guidance is based on our core Industrial Gases portfolio as it is today. Therefore it does not include any upside from any share repurchase or future acquisitions. Our fiscal year guidance is consistent with our long-term goal to improve Air Products earnings per share by 10% per year over the long-term. In the last two years, we have delivered much more than that and we are going to strive to continue to deliver 10% earnings per share growth every year. And despite the weak economy, a key reason we remain confident we can continue to develop a strong performance is the success of our $600 million cost improvement program that we announced two and a half years ago. We have fully delivered the first $300 million, and in terms of the second $300 million we delivered over $75 million in 2016 which is twice what we had promised you before and we expect to deliver another $100 million of cost savings in addition to that in 2017, again ahead of our previous commitments. To wrap up, please turn to slide 25 for our priorities as we move Air Products forward. While we will always stay focused on improving our existing business, the major restructuring of Air Products is behind us and our focus is now on profitable growth. We have the balance sheet capacity now to take advantage of the very exciting growth opportunities we see, including accretive and complementary acquisitions focused on our core Industrial Gases business, and large projects around the world driven by market demand for more energy, environmental improvements, and emerging market growth. And since we'll have a significant amount of cash at our disposal, we can be successful with these large opportunities, while we maintain our current A credit rating and continue our commitment to grow our dividend every year. And finally, we will consider share repurchases, if the market provides a compelling opportunity. Let me say in closing that our people continue to step up and deliver. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication and commitment, and the hard work that they are doing everyday to provide excellent service to our customers and make Air Products the best industrial gas company in the world. Without their efforts, we would not have been able to deliver these results. And now, we would be delighted to answer any questions that you might have.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Impressive guide given that it doesn't include the cash deployment, could you kind of talk us through the moving pieces that get you that double-digit core growth?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes, absolutely. As I said, we are committed to deliver an additional $100 million of cost savings. That by itself is about $0.35. And then in addition to that, we have new plants that we have built, that are continuing to come on-stream, so we will have organic growth. Therefore, the combination of productivity and organic growth that we see based on the plants that we see coming on-stream, that is what gives us the confidence to deliver the results that we're talking about next year. Because that means that next year, we are not making any assumptions for any significant economic growth worldwide, we will have a currency headwind, but we feel very good about our productivity programs. Our people did a great job in delivering the $75 million more than that last year. We are confident that we will get that and on top of that with the growth rate that we see, we are – as you know, we have always been committed to promise what we can deliver and usually deliver more than what we can promise.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And then, obviously can you comment on the potential impact of another round of consolidation among the global major gas companies? Do you think the regulatory environment is supportive of that deal, and what kind of would be the impact if it went through?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I don't want to comment on what other people are doing or might do, but Air Products is focused on a strategy which is based on organic growth and productivity improvement, and we will continue to execute that strategy. What other people might do, I don't think it will have much of an effect on us at all.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, good morning, fellas.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Duffy. How are you?
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good. Thanks. Probably the biggest question I am getting on your guys lately and Seifi, I'd love to get your color on this is, obviously assuming that the deal to Evonik goes through, you guys will be sitting on a big pile of cash come next year. How should we think about your ability to employ that, maybe over the proceeding 18 months or so?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Obviously, we are committed to do that. We – sitting on top of a little bit of cash for a rainy day is okay, but sitting on top of $3 billion of cash is obviously not what we intend to do. We do have – we believe we do have plans to deploy that cash properly, we are not in a hurry to do that, we are not going to do anything rash, but we feel very good about that.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then there has been a lot of noise in China this year around some of the rules and regulations in coal mining, the number of days they can run plants has changed a couple of times. Has that impacted at all the way you view the long-term coal gasification opportunity or has that impacted any of the current business you have in that industry?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, Duffy, I honestly think that there is a little bit of a confusion about what those rules are. What we see from those, we are close to that, we are on the ground. We see absolutely no effect and actually we see positive developments. We are very optimistic about those big projects, we think they will happen and we don't see anything in the Chinese government policy that would affect the kind of things that we want to do in terms of clean coal and coal gasification in China.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Terrific. Thank you, fellas.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, everyone.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Vince.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Hi, Vincent.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. So, Latin America, you called out some weakness and then also EMEA had minus 4% volume growth. It seems like those were a little bit weaker sequentially than at least we thought. Can you just talk about what dynamics are there and then what might have changed, particularly I guess on Europe and the minus 4% volume?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Absolutely. I think, I'd like Corning to address that. Corning, please?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. So, as I said in my comments, the big challenge there was in the liquid bulk area. If we think about the merchant business, there is two spaces, packaged gases and liquid bulk. Packaged gases for sometimes have been impacted just by slowing construction activity, metals fab. But, we saw a drop-off in this quarter in liquid bulk larger for us than what we had in packaged gases. But more than 50% of that was in wholesale volumes, and that goes a little bit to our drive, to just start driving an improved quality of our business, and our goal moving forward would be not to reload that business with wholesale volumes, instead shift that to retail volume for us.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Corning, you might want to also mention about the effect in Europe, about the effect of August in terms of sequentially.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, fair enough. So, if we think about in the purely sequential look we go through – you just have to keep in mind that the holiday season in Europe is in this previous quarter with August. So, I think, that's a big part of the drop off there. If you're looking at the raw numbers, you've also got the impact that shifted with currency with the Brexit vote, which is the one part of that, that we've seen. And I would say, overall, you take through and you say shifting to a more of a retail based net business. I think, we're well positioned there.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, with this drop off in wholesale volumes, should we assume that there is going to be some volume weakness for the next couple of quarters until you lap that?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I wouldn't see – yeah, I wouldn't see that coming back overnight agreed.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Especially as we are pushing that to retail volume.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Moving on we'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, P.J. How are you today?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good. So for a long time, Industrial Gas executives believed that big M&A is not possible, but that notion is being challenged. Do you have any interest in big M&A or would you rather sit back and buy any pieces that may come out?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: P.J., I don't want to comment on what our competitors are doing, but we think pursuing big M&A among the four major industrial gas companies is a foolish idea and we are not going to pursue foolish ideas. So we are not going, we don't have any plans to participate, we'll sit back and if anything happens, there certainly will be a lot of pieces that comes out. We have a lot of cash that would be kind of Christmas for us if it happens.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Really thank you for that color.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you sir.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just a quick question on your CapEx, which is going up in 2017 versus 2016, as you start up some of these projects. What kind of EPS contribution do you expect from new projects in 2017? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: From the projects that are – any future projects that we do whenever we announce the CapEx, you should assume that will have a minimum of 10% return. We have made that commitment. The projects that we have on-stream coming on in 2017 will be a combination of the new projects we have approved like Big River Steel and a combination of projects which were approved many years ago. That combination of the two as I said the new ones will have 10% and the old ones will probably have an average of about 5% return.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Very helpful.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Moving on we'll take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, David. How are you doing these days?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good, thank you, very good. Seifi just looking again 2017 in terms of pricing benefits in 2017, how should we think about those from an EPS perspective?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, David, as you know very well, we cannot, should not and would not comment on pricing. I think I would be very hesitant to start giving you any specific number but you would expect that, that is one of the things that we do. We are focused on improving productivity, we are focused on improving our pricing and our pricing can improve not only by increasing prices to cover inflation, but it will improve based on what Corning was talking about in change of the mix, in terms of going from wholesale to direct sale and all of that. So there is some element of pricing in next year's guidance, yes.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And just on the deployment of the cash and the capital, as you bid for these projects, are they competitive bid situations or are they more one-off negotiated transactions you're looking at?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: David, I think you should assume that everything we do is a competitive situation. I don't think that for these large projects, any of the customers would just want to do a private deal with us. But we are prepared for that, we bring a lot of value to our customers not only in terms of pricing, but in terms of all of the other services we provide. So we're prepared for competition, but we remain very optimistic that we have an advantage, and we have won a lot of projects, some of it unfortunately we cannot announce, because our customers would like to keep that confidential. But we are winning more than our fair share of projects in the last two years. I'm not worried about that at all.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. By what percentage is Jazan complete? And for your Indian hydrogen project of 165 million cubic feet per day, I mean that comes on in phases, how much comes on in 2017?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We expect our project in India to come on-stream approximately in the first half of – calendar 2017. So there will be less than half a year contribution from that project in our 2017 numbers. As for Jazan, we have made progress, and I will be hesitant to publicly talk about percentage complete. But I can say that we are moving on plan on schedule on that project, and we are obviously very optimistic and our people are delivering on that. And we have a great customer in Aramco, they are being very helpful to us and they are pushing us obviously to get the project done as soon as possible and we are on plan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then for my follow-up. If it turns out in the course of 2017, there is nothing that you are able to buy. And it also turns out that your share price is flat, would your share price then represent a compelling opportunity at the end of the year or it wouldn't?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, it depends on what the share price is. I mean if you are asking me that would we buy shares at $133, I'm not sure I want to comment on that, but...
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Anything – Jeff, you know better than I do the events in the world, I mean what is the market going to look like two weeks from now. A lot of things can happen. So we – the good thing is that we have the cash and we will watch what happens.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Moving on we'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect, thank you. Just an extension of your comments right there, you've obviously spoken about kind of the key macro and some of the political risks in the context of capital deployment, but can you just give us an update on how you're actually thinking about this versus let's say three months to six months ago, are there any changes in your expectations overall opportunities or evaluations broadly particularly outside of the U.S.? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I guess, I would have to characterize it that I am more optimistic than I was six months ago about our ability to deploy the cash. But I do want to stress that there are certain events in the world that can change everything upside down, and I think it's very prudent for us rather than jumping in and doing something this minute to give ourselves a few months to see how everything settles down with the U.S. election, and with the Brexit and all of that, and then we will make the appropriate moves.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. And as a quick follow-up, within the Gases in Asia, you're seeing some decent volume growth, and you are now holding price flat on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis. Can you just talk a little bit more about the broad drivers in the market specifically, any changes in merchant capacity and/or strategy that's helping the overall results? Thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Corning, would you like to...?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah. So let me answer that. I'm not sure, I'm going to go into all of our strategy and want to discuss that in a public setting, but maybe just to give you a little bit more color to it. So there remains significant overcapacity in the market and there remains probably over 5,000 tons to 10,000 tons of capacity that's either under construction or it's been idled or people delayed startup. So I think the overcapacity story is there for a while but a positive thing for us has been for several years now, we've made a strong drive to drive the retail portion of this business and you could see that's been working for us and that gives us an improvement on the mix. All in all I would say the pricing environment in LOX/LIN is slightly improved, you don't see that in the overall number because of the impact of helium. I just say, we didn't put that in the prepared comments because I'd really like to see how this plays out a few quarters into the future before we declare a trend there. So all in all though, I'd say that's positive, it's positive for us to be able to get the retail volume growth and I think that's all in all a very good thing for Air Products going forward, a lot of confidence in the team there.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: If I may just add to Corning's comment that we are very happy to be in China and we think we have a very good future here.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Moving on, we'll now take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. Seifi, you mentioned in your remarks, your pipeline has some large oxygen and hydrogen opportunities in it. Can you just comment on what portion of those would you see as standalone plans versus potential pipeline bolt-on projects? And how would you see the – those opportunities relative to where they've been over the last few years, are they – are there more or less and where?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Most of the opportunities that we see are in U.S. Gulf Coast and in China, and some in Europe. Most of the opportunities are – some of the opportunities are on our pipeline and especially our hydrogen pipeline, but a lot of the opportunities are standalone plants, large plants, supplying significant amounts of oxygen and hydrogen – and nitrogen to coal gasification, refineries, and all of that live features (54:14) and project. There are not that many there you are – as you might say we are hanging on a liquid capacity.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes, sir.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, thank you for that. Just with respect to your $100 million cost reduction target in fiscal 2017, can you just comment on what are the key projects that will be driving that?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Those key projects are under the title of what we call Taking the Lead project that Corning has been leading and they are absolutely focused on operational improvements in our production and in our distribution and some – and those are the main key areas. But, I'd like to comment – Corning to comment – elaborate on that please?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We've tried to in each of the recent earnings releases just give a concrete example of one thing that we're working on. The reality of this business though it's a very distributed business, right? We don't have world class plants where you export all around the world from one site, we have over 700 plants. And so it's a business of transactions and many plants and as Seifi says sometimes, the 10,000 little things. And so a big part of this is motivating the team and keeping ourselves focused on executing across those 10,000 things. I'd say that the move towards a regional structure has dramatically improved that, including the operating control in the region and the move to an incentive plan based on that same regional structure has been a big part of this as well, but all of that together really comes down to just the commitment of the people and the focus to deliver on this.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: If I may just add to that, as we have said many times before. We do have very detailed programs region by region, in terms of what they need to do. Based on what we accomplished in 2016, I am very confident that we will deliver at least $100 million next year.
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: If I could just jump in on this because this is a topic we're really happy about. We're all wearing in this room, these buttons, right with our four S's, the new culture at Air Products, and we have those plans just like Seifi talked about. And we beat them. And I think it goes one of those S's for us is speed and those regional teams we got out of the way, they were empowered, they were motivated, and they went and they got it done. And I think we are very proud around the world of what these groups have done. But I think it's a sign, right of embracing a new culture here at Air Products.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners: Yes, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners: My question relates to – good morning. With regard to Jazan what sort of incremental profit contribution might we expect in the fiscal 2017 versus 2016? And perhaps you can elaborate on the fourth quarter you just reported, and the shift from a red number to a black? I think the press release indicated a cumulative catch-up? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. I obviously cannot and should not comment on the profitability of the Jazan project. For 2017, we do not have a significant amount of contribution, but it – there will be some contribution. And quite honestly, it will depend on the exact progress that we make on all of that. But there will be some. In 2016, we did not recognize, although we were recognizing sales throughout the year, we did not recognize profit, because we wanted to get some kind of a, more of a sure footing that the project is moving forward. As you know, there has been a lot of talk about shutting down projects in Saudi Arabia and all of that, and we wanted to make sure that this project doesn't get cancelled, and then we would have to reverse profit on all of that. But then by fourth quarter, it became obvious that we have made enough progress that you should recognize some and that's what we did.
Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Moving on we'll take our next question from John Roberts from UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. How big is electronics now for the remaining gases business, and were your nitrogen sales to electronics roughly up in line with Versum or the EMD volume numbers that you presented?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: The size of that business order of magnitude is about $0.5 billion, and we were up 11%. So, we are doing well there.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Mike Sison from KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Seifi, when you gave your outlook for 2017, you highlighted cost of new projects and – and is there upside in the event the industrial world does get better? And maybe just kind of your thoughts that doesn't sound, do you think it could get better, is it stable, is it getting worse? Just surprised that, you wouldn't add that as a component of potential growth next year.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, the thing is that, as compared to, and I mean we are operating the same boat compared to our competitors. I mean, we are delivering double-digit growth while other people are showing negative growth, so we are doing something right. With respect to next year, we are – there is a possibility that we will do better than what we have given you as a guidance depending on the economy and all that. But I just want to remind everybody that, we are dealing with some significant worldwide events that we have to see how they will develop. We have given you a guidance on the basis that barring any significant disruptions, we will be able to deliver that and we have – that's the way we operate. Now, the economic conditions can get better once the U.S. election is over and people are not sitting on the fence, then, yeah, it is possible that we will do better than that. But the one thing that I can assure you is that, we don't operate on the basis of just delivering the guidance. We do our best to deliver whatever we can. That's kind of our goal.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. A question on the opportunity to buy captive ASUs. Could you say, do you think the multiple for such acquisitions would be higher, lower or the same as other M&A opportunities. And also could you frame any synergy potential of such captive ASU acquisitions?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: On that one, unfortunately, I can't give you a general answer, because it will depend on the specific situations. But what you said can apply, and it can be a specific situation that there is significant synergies. Because we already have two plants there and an addition of another two plants or three plants will add value. So, sorry, that I can't give you a general answer, but you can be, rest assured that we would only do those, if they are in line with our goal of getting a return on our – on the capital that we employ which is not less than 10%.
James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And can you also give us a sense for any stranded cost that you still have in 2017? What the timeframe would be for eliminating those and how they affect the cadence of your earnings progression in 2017?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, we have said that those stranded costs could be in the order of magnitude of $20 million. We have programs for eliminating those in the next year and a half and our guidance obviously reflects that those costs are still with us and we need to work to eliminate those.
James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning, Don. How are you today?
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Very good, thank you. Question on your FX assumptions within your guidance. Currency was a $0.16 drag in fiscal 2016, you got some sterling exposure. Just wondering what kind of headwind you're assuming in your 2017 guidance?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: I think the number is about $0.05, but the expert on this is Scott. So, Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, that's a tall order Seifi. Hi, Don. So, just to remind everybody how we look at currency. We don't try to speculate, we take the latest rates and we just project that forward. So, when we do that from where we are today into 2017, and then compare full year 2017 against 2016, we'd have a headwind of about $0.05 to $0.10, that's for the full year. And then on a quarter basis, we do the same approach, just move things sideways. We would have, in the first quarter, both sequentially as well as versus prior year in Q1, about a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind, principally driven by the pound.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And then on the project Seifi, you mentioned that you're still working through some projects that were signed before you arrived. Are those pretty much over by the end of 2017, and what's the total – where does the backlog stand today versus where it was at the beginning of fiscal 2016.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: We had a detailed chart on this thing, on the slide that we have...
Michael Scott Crocco - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Slide 29.
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Slide 28.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yeah, slide 28. So, you can see – and I'm sure you know very well, which ones they signed before and which ones they signed after. They will not all be over in 2017 because some of them are delayed and it will drag on into 2018 also.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Moving on, we will take our next question from Michael Harrison from Seaport Global Securities.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Seifi, you mentioned that you felt like you were gaining – winning more than your fair share of new projects in large on-site business. I was wondering if you can talk about the North American merchant business and what you're seeing in terms of new account growth there? And in particular, can you maybe comment on what the core LOX/LIN volume look like in the quarter and what the outlook is for fiscal 2017?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Sure. I think Corning can answer that very easily. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, LOX/LIN if we were going to look at that let's just say it's the most generic product goes into the most – largest number of industries it's probably the best sort of bellwether of everything. Year-on-year that was flat for us, however sequentially we were up about 2% so showing some positive momentum there. Even in that year-on-year flat however, I'd say that during the course of the year, we did make some adjustments in our portfolio as part of our Take the Lead program. We also had one situation, not exactly the same as Carrington what I talked about but where we did shut down a liquefier and we're able to shift some load around but that also did involve shutting some customers. So, all in all I think, approximately the best indication is just the sequential moving forward which gave us 2% and I see that as a net positive for us and I think a pretty good reflection of what's going in North America.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. And then you mentioned that within the corporate segment that LNG business was going to be a $0.25 EPS headwind next year. Is there anything that they could change in the market, that could swing that or do you have pretty good visibility based on the projects that are in the pipeline now that that's going to be weaker no matter what happens?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: No. I think, the guidance that we have given you about $0.25 is based on what we see, but there are things that can happen that can change that because a lot of these projects. We have won the projects, but the oil and gas companies have put a hold on them as you know very well because of the situation. They can change if the oil prices significantly change. They can change their mind, they can release those and therefore, we can start working on them. So the possibility of that, I don't see being great but it is possible.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Yes.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: But the $0.25 is real and it is based on what we have. So I'm glad that you brought that up because if you take that $0.25 into account, then we're actually giving a pretty good guidance in terms of growth next year, but that's based on what we see right now.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And moving on, we'll take our final question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Good morning.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Congratulations, you've got a pretty good engine going now with this business.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Thank you.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: A longer-term question, as your business mix continues to shift towards being more and more on-site, have you had any indication from either your large customers or from the rating agencies that their tolerance for leverage would change given the better – should the better or more stable mix of the business?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, that is something that we are hoping that would be the case but we have to wait and see, but we are pushing towards more on-site because then you get a more stable revenue growth and a more stable profitability, but we are paying attention to all parts of our business whether it's large on-sites or merchant business and our packaged gases business in the areas of the world where we are strong. So we are not neglecting any part of the business but the trend seems to be more towards the large on-sites. And obviously if we win one of those projects it adds a lot to that part of the business.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: And then just lastly, are you seeing sort of – as you have early discussions with customers about the next cycle of projects in 2018, 2020 and so on. It looks as if the size of projects just keeps getting larger. Will we get to the point where you're seeing sort of one-off, $500 million to $1 billion project agreements?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Well, I can actually see bigger than that. There are projects that you would, like Jazan $2 billion and there are projects that might require $4 billion. So you're right, the trend is towards larger projects and that is why having the balance sheet that you can do those projects becomes very important and that has been our target because we saw that trend before and that is one of the reasons that we wanted to restructure and make sure that Air Products has a bulletproof, solid balance sheet that we can take on those mega projects. You're very right about that.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Air Products & Chemicals, Inc.: Okay. With that I would like to thank everybody for being on the call. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule especially today with all of the announcements to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the best. Thank you.
Operator: And again, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release. During the call today, we will provide a progress update on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik and the spin-off of the Electronic Materials as Versum materials. The quarterly results we are sharing today and our guidance for fourth quarter EPS includes both PMD and EMD in continuing operations. We continue to evaluate the progress of both transactions to determine when to report these businesses in discontinued operations. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases; Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products' Executive Vice President, in charge of our Materials Technology business, who will be the future CEO of Versum Materials; and Mr. George Bitto, Vice President, Finance for Material Technologies, who will be the future CFO of Versum Materials. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. I am very pleased to report that our team at Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite these sluggish economic growth worldwide and continued currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on executing our strategic 5 point plan. We delivered earnings per share of $1.92, which is up 16% over last year, and it is the eighth consecutive quarter that Air Products has reported double-digit earnings-per-share growth. We also improved our EBITDA margin by more than 300 basis points and our Return on Capital Employed increased 200 basis points to 13.5%. I do want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to delivery outstanding results and move our company forward to be the best in the industry. As we move closer to the sale of our Performance Material division to Evonik and tax-free spin-off of our Electronics Material division now called Versum to our shareholders, we see great opportunities ahead to bring key projects and invest in our core industrial gases business so that we grow Air Products in the years to come. Now, please turn to slide number three. Our quarter three safety performance was better than last year and last quarter, but I do want to mention that the only acceptable goal for us is zero accidents. We have the responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home after a hard-day work with no injuries or incidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee. Now, please turn to slide number four, which is the statement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side and I'm confident that we can focus and continue to improve our performance on the safety side. Now, please turn to slide number five. Here you can again see our overall management philosophy. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long-term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company. Now, please turn to slide number six, our 5 point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on executing our 5 point plan. The first point of the plan is our focus on industrial gases, our core business, and therefore, we are in the process of divesting our non-core businesses. As Scott, Guillermo and George will provide you details, but we're making great progress on the sale of Performance Materials to Evonik, and we expect that the deal will close before the end of this calendar year. And we are well on our way to the tax-free spin-off of Electronics Materials to our shareholders at Versum Materials. These transactions will be excellent for the employees of all three companies. Air Products will be focused on its core Industrial Gases business, PMD employees will be core to a world-class materials company at Evonik and EMD employees will be an independent best-in-class electronics material company. And because these are the right strategic moves, I firmly believe that these actions will also create shareholder value in the long-term. We also continue to work hard on the fourth point of our plan, the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. A robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million means we have visibility and control to ensure we earn a minimum expected return of 10% on all of our new projects. We continue to enjoy a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue and earnings growth over the next few years. I am very optimistic about the growth potential of our core industrial gases business, especially opportunities in on-site oxygen and hydrogen plants. In addition, the separation of PMD and EMD from Air Products will leave about $20 million of stranded costs at Air Products. We are committed to eliminating additional work to offset these costs within a year of closing the transactions I mentioned. Now, please turn to slide number seven for the summary of our results for the quarter. As Scott will take you through the details, but I want to emphasize that the operational improvement actions we have taken this year and the benefits of restructuring actions we took last year enabled us to deliver these strong results, despite the weak worldwide economy and continuous currency headwinds. Now, please turn to slide number eight. You can see quarter by quarter our progress during the last two years. You will note that we have improved our EBITDA margin by more than 900, yes, 900 basis points. This single chart is a great example of the focused efforts of the people at Air Products; once again, I thank all of them for their contribution. Now, please turn to slide number nine. This single slide, again, truly captures the essence of what the people of Air Products have achieved. Two years ago, we announced that our collective goal was to be the most profitable industrial gas company in the world as measured by each of these financial metrics. The conventional wisdom at that time was that it cannot be done, that Air Products did not have the portfolio of businesses or so-called density to achieve this goal. But the people of Air Products rolled up their sleeves, went to work and said, yes, we can. So, today, Air Products has the best EBITDA margin in the industry at 34.2%, the highest EBIT margin in industry at 23%, and the highest Return on Capital Employed margin at 13.5%. Every single one of our 19,000 people have contributed to moving us forward to be the best in the industry, and let me tell you, our people are determined to maintain our leading position in the years to come. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo, George and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much, Seifi. Before I discuss our quarterly results, let me provide you with an update on the two transactions Seifi mentioned. In summary, things are proceeding as we expected. First, the sale of PMD to Evonik. We said we expect to close this transaction by the end of calendar 2016, and we are working hard to meet that goal, subject to the various required approvals. We are working closely with Evonik, on antitrust and other critical steps and are moving as quickly as possible. Second is the spin-off of EMD as Versum Materials. We said we are targeting to separate the EMD business from Air Products by September and the spin-off Versum as an independent publicly traded company in October. We are working hard to meet this goal, including completing a variety of legal entity separations and tax activity. George will talk about an important step in this process, the filing of Form-10, which we did last week. And while no one can predict what will happen in the markets, we are comfortable that at least today the markets would be conducive to proceeding with the spin. So although we have a lot more work to do, at this point, subject to the timing of obtaining regulatory approval, we are optimistic we will be ready to execute the spin-off in October. Now, please turn to slide 10. For our third quarter, sales of $2.4 billion decreased 1% versus last year, on lower energy pass-through and unfavorable currency impacts of 3% and 2% respectively. Volumes were 4% higher, primarily due to Jazan project. In other areas, volumes continued to be higher in gases, Asian and North America, offset by economic weakness in South America and Europe. Pricing was unchanged as positive pricing in gases Americas and Europe was offset by lower pricing in Asia and Performance Materials due to lower raw material costs. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter, as EBITDA of $833 million, improved by 10%, and operating income improved to $560 million, improved by 16% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin of 34.2% and operating margin of 23.0%, both improved by 340 basis points, as we continue to execute on our 5 point plan. All three regional industrial gas segment and Materials Technologies delivered margin improvement. Lower energy pass-thru only contributed about 50 basis points to the operating margin improvement. Excluding the impact of energy pass-thru, operating margin improved about 290 basis points, primarily from the benefit of self-help actions we've taken and a modest benefit from price and lower raw material costs. Versus prior year, net income increased by 17% and earnings-per-share grew 16%. And we continue to improve our Return on Capital Employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13.5% on our higher profitability. Now, please turn to slide 11. You’ve heard Seifi and I talked about our focus on cash flow, so we are pleased to see that our free cash flow was $191 million this quarter, up $95 million versus last year, due to higher EBITDA and lower growth CapEx. As a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter to quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash factors. Turning now to slide 12, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings-per-share. Before I comment on our Q3 operating performance, I’d like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.29 per share. We incurred Materials Technology separation cost of $10 million or $0.04 per share, primarily for legal and other advisory fees. As a result of our decision to separate MT, we declared a dividend to repatriate $444 million from a subsidiary in South Korea, resulting in an income tax cost of $46 million or $0.21 per share. We’ve recognized this book cost in Q3, because that's when the decision was made. However, the cash flow impact will be seen in Q4 when we actually pay the tax. And as I mentioned last quarter, we’ve completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of restructuring, and now we’re focused on our second $300 million of operational improvements. We incurred a $15 million or $0.04 per share charge associated with these operational improvement actions, and this included a $1 million pension settlement charge. Excluding these items, our Q3 continuing operations’ EPS of $1.92, increased $0.26 per share or 60% versus last year. The impact from volumes increased EPS by $0.01 per share. Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.04, partially driven by lower raw material costs. Net cost performance was $0.25 favorable, in part due to the benefit of our operational improvements and from last year's restructuring actions. Cost performance also benefited about $0.15 primarily from lower incentive compensation and lower pension cost. Currency was $0.05 unfavorable, as many currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation, as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Equity affiliate income was unchanged; interest expense was $0.02 higher, primarily due to lower capitalized interest. Taxes were modestly lower, contributing $0.01 to earnings. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, well, likely closer to 25%. Non-controlling interest was $0.03 favorable, primarily due to our increased ownership position in Indura. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced our diluted EPS by $0.01. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I’ll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning Painter: Thanks, Scott. I’m pleased to present another quarter of very strong results, and would like to thank the entire industrial gases team around the world for staying focused on the things we control. Our commitment to driving operational productivity of staying focused on safety allowed us to overcome currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions to deliver another great quarter. In addition, we are very excited that we continue to compete for and win key projects that will support industrial gases growth into the future. Just last week, we announced a new plan to provide ultrahigh purity gases to customers in the Pukou Economic Development Zone in Nanjing, China. The Pukou Economic Development Zone is a state-level part that will be home to semiconductor and other high-tech manufacturing. In fact, the world’s leading semiconductor foundry recently announced an investment of $3 billion for a new 300 mm wafer fab, scheduled to commence production of 16 nanometre technology in 2018. We are very encouraged by the progress we have made on our taking the lead operational improvement initiative. We've seen positive results across all regions and are encouraged by the actions and the behaviors that will enable us to deliver our second $300 million commitment. For example, to improve distribution efficiency, we are optimizing delivery parameters, such as outbound and inbound way customer delivery restrictions and tank size. Many themes impact distribution efficiency and our regional incentive plan helps to align their efforts. Now, please turn to slide 13 for review of our Gases America's results. Our double-digit EBITDA and operating income improvements were driven by our combined focus on self-help operational improvement and the benefits of last year's restructuring action. Sales of $832 million were down 7% versus last year, as the pass-thru of lower energy prices reduced sales by 5% and currency reduced sales by 2%. Overall, Americans volumes were down 1%, as Latin American volumes being down mid-teens, negatively impacted overall Americans by 2%. We saw weakness in our packaged gases, equipment and liquid, both businesses across most of our key geographies in Latin America. In contrast, North America volumes were up, contributing a positive 1% to our overall America’s volume, as we saw the benefit of our new hydrogen plant in Canada and strong hydrogen demand in the US Gulf Coast. The new Canadian plant is running well and we anticipate increased profit contributions from this plant as an additional customer comes on stream in late 2017. Overall LOX/LIN volumes were down. I’d like to make three points on this. First, same customer volumes, year-on-year, were up slightly. Second, we’re beginning to lap last year's decline in the oilfield services business; however, this is still a headwind for us this quarter. And third, we have not yet seen an improvement in the steel business. Pricing was up 1% with particular success in Latin America. Operating income of $235 million was up 14%, and EBITDA of $362 million was up 11% versus last year, as the benefits of our operational improvements and restructuring actions more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency, and lower energy pass-thru. We set another record operating margin this time of 28.2%, up over 500 basis points, and another record EBITDA margin of 43.5%, up 700 basis points. Lower energy pass-thru accounted for about 100 basis points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up over 400 basis points excluding the lower energy pass-thru. Now, please turn to slide 14. For our Europe, Middle-East and Africa business, we continue to see our operational improvements, restructuring and price actions more than offsetting volume weakness and currency headwinds as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $427 million were down 6% due to a negative 5% impact from lower energy pass-thru and a negative 1% currency impact. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes down 1% on weakness in the UK, Ireland, and in central Europe, partially offset by slight positive demand in southern Europe. Given the timing of the BREXIT vote, we don't believe it impacted this quarter, but uncertainty has clearly increased going forward. Prices were up 1%, our sixth consecutive quarter of positive pricing despite the weak economy and low inflation. We continue to focus our efforts on ensuring that each customer is profitable for our business. Operating income of $103 million was up 18% and EBITDA of $160 million was up 9% as our productivity and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. Record operating margin of 24.2% and record EBITDA margin of 37.4% were both up over 500 basis points. Lower energy pass-thru accounted for about 100 basis points, meaning that the underlying operating margin was up 400 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-thru. Please turn slide 15 Gases Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of operational improvements and cost reduction actions drove significant profit growth this quarter. Sales of $448 million were up 7%, primarily driven by volumes of 14%, partially offset by a negative 5% impact from currency, primarily from China, Korea and Taiwan, and a negative 2% price impact. Roughly two-thirds of the volume increase was from new plant, including an increase in energy pass-thru revenue. Our merchant business was up mid-single digits across Asia and our China retail LOX/LIN business was up double-digit. That said, we expect the oversupply conditions in China to remain for some time certainly through at least next year. Sequential volume increase of 10% was driven by a seasonal recovery from the Lunar New Year, as well as an increase in energy pass-thru revenue. Pricing was down 2% versus last year, as we continue to see a moderating rate of decline in China LOX/LIN/LAR pricing, however, we have seen more price pressure in helium. Operating income of $118 million was up 17%, and EBITDA of $182 million was up 10%, as our productivity actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price. Operating margin of 26.4% was up over 200 basis points, and EBITDA margin of 40.7% was up over 100 basis points. I’ll close with a brief comment on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business, as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gas business, which are not region specific. Sales were up as we recognized about $100 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment, that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Segment profits improved on lower cost and a few non-recurring items last year. Now, please turn to slide 16. And I’ll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment result.
Guillermo Novo: Thank you, Corning. As Scott mentioned, we’re making great progress on both the sale of our Performance Materials business and spin-off of our Electronic Materials business. You can see the Materials Technologies continues to show strong results. Even though we are on our separation journey, I’m going to focus my comments today at the division level. Please turn to slide 17 for review of our Performance Materials division. Sales of $277 million were flat as 4% higher volumes were offset by 4% lower price. The positive volume was driven by strength in our epoxy and markets including wind, adhesives and flooring, and improve polyurethane additives volume across most markets. This was offset by specialty additives weakness due to lower oil and gas related activity and the temporary shutdown of a specific mining customer in Brazil. Overall, prices were down, driven by broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material costs. Performance Materials EBITDA of $69 million was up 6%, and operating income of $63 million was up 9%. ETBIDA margin of 24.9% was up 130 basis points, and operating margins of 22.7% was up 180 basis points, primarily driven by productivity and favorable price from material balances. Please turn to slide 18. Versum Materials, the planned spin-off of our Electronic Materials business. As I shared with you in June, I'm very excited to be responsible for Versum Materials, a company with solid growth, high margins, low capital intensity and very high free cash flow. Versum is a very strong business, both from a market leadership and financial perspective. We operate in the semiconductor space which will present us with exciting and profitable growth opportunities. We are being setup for success. It’s a good company that will have the capability to profitably grow organically and inorganically. And finally, our team is very excited about the opportunity to be the best-in-class pure play Electronic Materials Company. On slide 19, you can see the historical EBITDA margin for our EMD business as reported within our products. As you can see, the sustainable and fundamental changes we made to our business will allow us to deliver strong margins into the future. Let’s take a look at the results for this quarter on slide 20. Please remember these financials offer EMD as reported within Air Products. Our team delivered another strong quarter, proving we’re staying focused on servicing our customers and driving operational improvements while we continue to deliver new and innovative solutions to our customers. Sales of $243 million were down 8% on 6% lower volumes, flat pricing and a 2% negative currency effect. As you can see, all of the negative volume impact was due to delivery systems. As expected, delivery systems was down significantly compared to high level of project activity last year, but this level of activity dropped off in the fourth quarter of last year, so it won't be a significant headwind next quarter. Overall, Materials volumes were flat as we continue to see growth in our advanced Materials business, partially offset by softer volumes in our profit materials. Although the foundry market has been soft in the first part of year, we’re seeing improvements and demand from our foundry customers in the last few months. EBITDA of the $86 million was down 7% and operating income of $73 million was down 5% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.3% and operating margins of 30.0%, both up modestly. Pricing, mix and the benefit of our operational improvement actions were more than offset by headwinds from currency and the lower delivery systems volumes. Before I turn the call over to George, to discuss our financials, let me just say that we look forward to more discussions with you about a very exciting Versum Materials business in the next few months leading up toward spin-off. Now, let me pass the call over to George Bitto, our future CFO for Versum Materials. George?
George Bitto: Thank you, Gibbo. Please turn to slide 21, where you can see the updated trailing-12 month results for EMD. Remember, this is as reported within Air Products, so it does not include any corporate costs that are not business specific. Sales of almost $1 billion and EBITDA margins of 36% continue to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins. As part of our preparation for the spin-off, we filed an update to our Form-10 with the SEC last week and we provided a few slides today to help you extract the key information from the Form-10. These slides are available on our website. Given the requirements of the Form-10, there are a few different financial bases that I wanted to take a moment to explain. First, there are the financials you've seen reported for EMD within Air Products, again, it's important to remember that Air Products does not allocate any non-business specific corporate cost into the business segment. Second, the Form-10 includes Versum-audited combined financial statements. The most significant difference between these and EMD financials is the allocation of Air Products corporate cost to Versum. And finally, the Form-10 also includes Versum unaudited pro forma financial statements for FY15 and the first half of FY16, which includes adjustments to reflect Versum on a post-separation basis. The two major areas of adjustments to point out are a few small product lines that are currently reported in EMD, which will stay with Air Products after the spin. It’s about $22 million of sales and about $11 million of profits per year, and the impact of $1.15 billion of debt, down slightly from the $1.25 billion we’ve talked about in the past. We continue to believe that Versum will operate very successfully within initial debt ratio in the three to four times EBITDA range. We will continue to refine our thoughts on the right debt and leverage levels to support Versum’s very exciting growth opportunities as we move closer to the spin. Now, please turn to slide 22. Given the various financials and a variety of time frames, we suggest that the most relevant cash flow numbers are shown on this slide. As referenced in the footnote, we start with $344 million, as reported for EMD for the last 12 months ending June 30, 2016, the same $344 million you saw on the previous slide. We subtract about $20 million of EBITDA for adjustments to get to Versum’s standalone, including public company costs. This adjustment includes about $15 million of expected new costs and about $5 million that was previously included as a non-cash depreciation charge. And then, we take out about $11 million of EBITDA primarily for products that will stay with Air Products, resulting in a revised trailing-12 month EBITDA of $313 million. Assuming a 6% interest rate on the $1.15 billion of debt and factoring in estimated cash taxes and capital spending, you can see the Versum generates a very high level of free cash flow, about $165 million that we can use to grow our business. Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Simon for a quick comment on our corporate segment.
Simon Moore: Thanks, George. Our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses, as well as corporate costs which are not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on lower LNG project activity and profits were about flat as lower costs offset the lower sales. As we've said, we’ve not seen delays or cancellations of any major equipment orders in our backlog, but the lack of customer decisions on new projects will impact our FY16 and FY17 results. This is likely to be about a $0.10 headwind in FY16 versus FY15, and will be an additional headwind for us in FY17. Now, please turn to slide 23 and I'll turn the call back over to Seifi, for discussion of our outlook.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you again, Simon. The Air Products’ team remains focused on implementing our 5 point strategic plan, to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.91 to $2.01. At midpoint, this will be an increase of about 7% over the fourth quarter of last years. Our full-year fiscal ‘16 guidance is now at $7.45 to $7.55. At midpoint, this will be an increase of 14% over already strong fiscal year [indiscernible] performance and is $0.13 or almost 2% higher than the annual guidance we gave you in October of last year. We now expect our CapEx to be no more than $1.2 billion for the year. As you can see from our results, we improved our cash flow by almost $100 million dollars this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: Number one, maintaining our A credit rating, that means we pay down debt to make sure that we have an A credit rating. Number two; invest in good projects and accretive acquisitions. We are very excited about the opportunities in our core industrial gases business. Petrochemical investments in the US Gulf Coast, refinery hydrogen plants around the world and oxygen for coal gasification in China present key growth opportunities for us and we believe Air Products is very well positioned to win profitable deals for these very large plants. Number three, priority for use of cash is continuing as we have to increase our dividend. And number four, if there is any excess cash available, we are very comfortable in returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. At the end of the day, the cash we generate belongs to our shareholders and we will only spend it if we have high-return projects or good acquisitions. And now, we will all be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll take our first question from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer: Just wanted to see if you could break down a little bit on the Americas gases, you helped us with the volume look at North America versus South America. Could you do the same thing for price and if you looked at price versus the two parts of the Americas, how was that different?
Seifollah Ghasemi: I’ll turn it over to Corning to comment on that.
Corning Painter: So, we had success in our pricing efforts in each area, I think it’s important to recognize what’s most important is price versus let’s say power in other input costs, and that was a positive for us.
Duffy Fischer: Okay, and then maybe just one comment on the recent steel tariffs that have been enacted, how do you see that affecting the global base of your steel customers? Is that a net positive for you guys?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Duffy, the way we see that, it’s not material enough yet to kind of make a comment on that. We’d like to wait a little bit more just to see that, we have not seen a significant change.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. And have you seen any change in behavior in the steel production in China, either from those tariffs or from their earlier proclamations by the Chinese government that there'd be some forced consolidation in that industry?
Seifollah Ghasemi: I think Corning can comment on that.
Corning Painter: So, I mean there has been a large announced consolidation with Baosteel. I think after the Lunar New Year, we saw steel prices spiked in Asia, in China, that spike was not very long lasted and came back down. So, I think there is like a momentum you could say in China and a commitment, and clearly a reality there is over capacity that needs to get source it out, but this is going to have to be worked through and there is social implications to that.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks, fellas.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Duffy.
Operator: Moving to our question, we’ll go with Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.
Christopher Parkinson: Perfect, thank you very much. Your margins continue to impress in the Americas, but can you comment on a few different end markets? You mentioned hydrogen demand remained strong, but are there any other trends across your portfolio worth noting, particularly in the bulk business? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: This is Industrial Gases. In Industrial Gases, I think Corning went through the details about the volumes and all that. Industry-wise, we don’t see any significant change. Our hydrogen volumes in the US continue to be strong because of the demand for gasoline, but nothing particular that we would want to point out as if anything has changed in the last quarter.
Christopher Parkinson: Perfect. And then, can you quickly comment on the longer-term potential for project activity? I know you've been optimistic on the US Gulf Coast, but do you have any incremental comments on the Middle East, Central Asia, or China, and whether or not you’re more or less optimistic than you were, let's say, six months ago? Just any perspective would be appreciated. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: We continue to be optimistic, and quite frankly, today, I’m more optimistic than I was last quarter or the quarter before that. We see a lot of opportunities because I think Air Products is very well positioned to take advantage of all of the opportunities that might come about in the US, in the Gulf Coast and in China. So, yes, I would summarize that we’re more optimistic, yes.
Christopher Parkinson: That's great color, thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, David, how are you doing?
David Begleiter: Good, than you. Seifi and Scott, on the Q4 guidance, still a $0.10 range here, what's the level - what's driving the uncertainty with a wide range at this late stage?
Seifollah Ghasemi: David, the only reason, as you know, we usually have a $0.05 range at this time of the year. The only reason we have put down $0.10 is that we are very concerned about what is actually going to happen to currency exchange rates. That’s something that is not under our control, I mean what is going to happen to the British pound, what is going to happen to the Chinese Yuan, therefore, we wanted to have a wider range because we can pretty well predict what our internal performance is going to be, but since we reported results and the translation is there, we don’t have a hand on, that’s why we didn’t want to get ahead of ourselves.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just last thing on the Jazan project, Seifi, can you talk about why revenues were up in the quarter sequentially, but losses were up as well in the global industrial gases segment?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, David, we are recognizing revenue but we are not recognizing the profit yet. The reason for that is that we want to move forward with the project a little bit more, and make sure that we are going to be able to meet the commitments that we have in the contract in terms of power consumption and schedule because there are speculated damages there, so we’re being conservative in recognizing profit. We will obviously at some point in time recognize profit, but we have not done that this quarter, we haven’t done that yet.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from PJ Juvekar from Citi.
PJ Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, PJ. How are you doing?
PJ Juvekar: I’m doing well, Seifi. A question on the backlog again, can you just give the dollar amount of the backlog? And in the past year, you talked about privatization of industrial gas assets from national oil companies, projects like Jazan, are you in discussions with those companies? And when do we see anything?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, our backlog, we had - slide number 27 that gives you a detail of the backlog. Our backlog currently stands at $2.1 billion, the reason it was lower than last quarter is because of the hydrogen plant coming on stream, but in terms of those kind of discussions, PJ, if you give me a break, I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to make any comment, because we are - when it comes to national oil companies and all of that, people would like to be a little bit more discreet. So, you know about our strategies, but I don’t want to comment in any detail.
PJ Juvekar: Okay, thank you. And then, just a question for Guillermo on Versum, you talked about sort of flat volumes, excluding delivery systems. Can you talk about any new wins or losses in new technologies like 16-nanometer you mentioned? And if your high-end applications are growing, what’s declining or what end markets are declining to keep overall volumes flat? Thank you.
Guillermo Novo: Thanks for the question. If you look at the pure materials side of the equation, our advanced materials actually has been growing well in the, I would say, low-to-mid single digits. It’s all driven by recovery of the foundry markets and a lot of the new technologies, I would point out Memory still being a very good market for us in driving a lot of the new growth. So, that part has been doing very well, in line with our expectations. If you look at Process Materials, I would say two things, one, we had some discontinued operations that we exited ammonia business in China and some other smaller pieces of business, so that’s a little bit of a headwind. And then the volumes, remember, we’ve been tied on capacity in a lot of major products, we’re expanding and bringing on some debottlenecking in the next few quarters. So it’s just really more ups and downs of the different product lines. Overall, if you exclude discontinued business, I would say our materials business grew in the 1.7% range.
PJ Juvekar: Thank you.
Guillermo Novo: Thank you, PJ.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, please go ahead.
Jim Sheehan: Thanks. Seifi, you've got cash coming in, the proceeds from the PMD divestiture and possibly more after EMD is finished. Can you talk about the timing of your uses of this cash? I know you've set out your priorities. Do you see using this cash for M&A or for new projects as more of a 12-month phenomenon or would the time frame be in multiple years?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, Jim, thanks for your question. The cash is - considering the timing of everything, we will really have our hands on the cash kind of beginning of 2017. Obviously, we are cognizant of what is coming and we would like to put that to good use. Our number one priority, after we have paid down the debt, because of the loss of the EBITDA that we have and making sure that we have our A rating, then we still can have a lot of cash on hand. And as I said before, our number one priority is organic growth, we see a lot of opportunities and we’re going to put that to work best. We are looking at acquisitions that’s not huge ones, but smaller ones, that would be a possibility. And then, the other thing is that in terms of timing it’s difficult to put a timeframe on that in terms of - because if some of these big projects happens, we can use that cash quickly, but I would like to add that the fact that we have cash doesn't mean that we're going to rush to spend it. We are going to be very prudent at the use of cash. I've always said, our capital allocation is one of my most important responsibilities, so we will look at things, the fact that we have cash gives us a lot of power to do things, but at the same time, we're not ready to just go and burn it up just because we have the cash.
Jim Sheehan: Great. Can you talk also about the possible impact of BREXIT on your project backlog and - both in Europe and other parts of the world? I mean, you yourself are taking a more cautious view of FX in the fourth quarter. How are project discussions going in light of BREXIT?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, the BREXIT, in terms of lost projects, I don’t know that many of them in Europe anyway, so I don't see too much of an impact on that, but the fundamental effects of BREXIT, I think, it is going to take many years to manifest itself. Personally, I think that that is going to have a very negative effect in the long term, but I don’t see any immediate effect in our businesses and we haven't seen that anybody has cancelled any project in China because of BREXIT. And there are people, as I'm sure you read the different articles that argue that BREXIT is going to actually weaken Europe and strengthen China, which I think might be the case.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our next question from Bob Court from Goldman Sachs.
Chris Evans: Good morning, everyone. This is Chris Evans on for Bob.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Hi Chris.
Chris Evans: So I was hoping - so cost was a big contributor in the quarter, and I guess as we look into the fourth quarter and beyond, your EPS guidance in the fourth quarter sort of implies a growth deceleration. So I kind of wanted to get your thoughts specifically on how cost might be an impact in your growth as you lap some of the benefits from the prior year?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Our guidance for the next quarter is entirely based on our activities in terms of our take the lead and cost actions. We are not counting on any significant improvement in economic activity, and we’re not counting on any significant appreciation because of exchange rates. Everything that we have done in the past two years, the improvement that you see in EPS, the double-digit growth in EPS is all due to the internal actions that the people of Air Products has taken, and that will be the contributor to our improvement for next quarter.
Chris Evans: Thanks. And then, I guess thinking about the company post-reorganization, what do you think the sustainable CapEx spend would be as you look out, and especially in regards to the current environment?
Seifollah Ghasemi: We think our CapEx requirements on the standalone company after we divest rest of the other business, it can be anywhere between $1 billion to $2 billion a year depending on how successful we are with the project.
Chris Evans: Got you, thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Just looking at slide eight, I wanted to make sure I understood your EBITDA margin declined sequentially for the second time in - well, only the second time in many quarters. And it looks like from a regional basis, Europe - sorry, not Europe, but Asia was part of it. So what was the driver of the sequential change, and how should we be thinking about it going into 4Q?
Seifollah Ghasemi: The only reason that that margin is down, Vincent, is because we have recognized $100 million of sale for Jazan with no profit. If you exclude that, our margin actually went up. That is the primary reason.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And then in the near term, it sounds like since you're more optimistic on the project outlook, you just referenced there could be $1 billion to $2 billion of CapEx in any given year going forward. You said $1.2 billion for this year, and then you've got the cash coming in. So should we be anticipating as we think about ‘17 and ‘18, that CapEx is going to wind up coming in nicely above the $1.2 billion, or how should we be dimensionalizing that?
Seifollah Ghasemi: One, Vincent, our goal will be to have enough projects to spend $2 billion a year because we can afford to do that. So, we are optimistic about the big projects and at the end of the day we have to deliver what we say, but we definitely think that and figure out $1 billion to $2 billion hopefully on the higher end would be a possibility.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll move to our next question from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Stephen Byrne: We are hearing that the Chinese central government is putting a halt on new gasification projects, but yet you included coal projects in China among the possible capital projects going forward. Have you seen any change in China with respect to new projects and/or bidding activity in that region?
Seifollah Ghasemi: No, we have not. I think Corning can expand on that, but we have not seen anything. There are a lot of projects going on, I think you have to be careful because most of the coal projects we are involved in are clean coal, I mean the Chinese government will probably have a different view if you’re building a power plant that is using coal, but the clean coal technology that is - we haven’t seen anything, but Corning…
Corning Painter: I think if you looked back a couple of years, looking backwards, there was a pause in approving these projects. Our REIT of the Chinese government, the five-year plan and so forth and just what we see on the ground is that they’re moving towards permitting and authorizing projects going forward. So, I think our view of moment is a little different than that.
Stephen Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question from Nils Wallin from CLSA Americas. Your line is open, Nils Wallin, please go ahead.
Nils Wallin: Sorry about that. Thanks again for taking my question. Whence you become a pure-play industrial gas company, your on-site exposure will be significantly higher than the industry. Do you think that's the right mix going forward? Or would you prefer to have even greater on-site exposure? And how might that affect the overall volatility of your long-term cash flows?
Seifollah Ghasemi: We believe very strongly that bigger portion of your business being on-site is a very good thing. And once we become pure-play, about approximately probably 55% of our sales will be on-site business, which is higher than anybody else and we will do everything to expand that. That is where we can get large projects contributing a steady cash flow to the business, that’s a lot better than going buying companies that sell welding glass.
Nils Wallin: Okay. And then, just in terms of the cash that's coming in that you seek to deploy. Obviously, you've talked about a lot of your projects currently having nothing less than a 10% hurdle rate. Will you apply the same or you'll apply a higher hurdle rate to the cash that you - that comes in from the sale and the spin?
Seifollah Ghasemi: What we have said about 10% is that - that is the minimum. Some of the projects that we have signed up for in the last two years have returns which are higher than that. So, on the new cash, our goal will be that if we’ll have a minimum of 10% and hopefully higher than that.
Nils Wallin: Very good, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. John Roberts from UBS.
John Roberts: Do you know what your 2016 guidance is on an equivalent adjusted pro forma basis for the two Versum transactions? That is, what is the $7.45 to $7.55 if we adjust it? And I ask that because a few months from now, you're going to report your fourth quarter, and you'd normally give us EPS guidance at that point. What are we going to compare next year to?
Seifollah Ghasemi: John, I’m afraid you have to wait until October for us to disclose that. There are too many moving part of our corporate cost and accounting methods and all of that, and I think it would be dangerous for me to get into that right now, but we will obviously disclose that to you once Versum and PMD are gone in accordance with the rules we will go back and restate actually the last five years. So you will have total visibility on exactly what’s going on.
John Roberts: Okay, I'll wait. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson: Seifi, a question on your returns, I know since you became CEO, you have hiked up your minimum return to 10%. So as we look at your project backlog, when do those higher return projects start to kick in? And when could we see an uptick in the earnings contribution from new projects?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Starting 2017, 2018, because these projects are two to four year projects, so some of the ones that we approved last year will come on stream in late 2017, 2018, 2019.
Don Carson: Okay. And then, within the quarter, I know you've given the FX impact on sales; what was the EPS impact of currency? And what is the implied full-year impact in your $7.45 to $7.55 guidance?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Scott will answer you that.
Scott Crocco: Sure. Hi, Don. So, for the quarter, Q3, currency impact versus last year was $0.05. If we look back on what we reported in both Q1 and Q2, that brings to a year-to-date of about $0.18 headwind. As we’ve talked in the past, the way that we handled currency as we take where we ended quarter, now we just assume that rates stay where they are for the rest of fiscal year. When we do that, we would see the fourth quarter relative to last year’s Q4 to be about another $0.02 headwind. So, total for FY16 versus FY15, we’re anticipating about $0.20 headwind year-on-year for currency.
Don Carson: Great. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll move to our next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Just quickly, can you give a little bit more detail on the improvement you're seeing in the Chinese liquid market? To what extent - can you peel back how much of that is sequential demand improvement compared to better competitor behavior?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, we obviously cannot comment on competitive behavior, but the rest of the question - Corning will answer that.
Corning Painter: Yeah. So, if you look at our overall, you’re thinking mainly liquid, let’s say in China, so we look at the overall for that, we were actually relative flat year-on-year on total, but the quality of our business went up, so we gained a substantial increase and a proportion of that that was going into retail sales. And that’s really where our focus has been on, and if you look at it maybe a little bit more granular than that, very substantial increase for us in nitrogen, oxygen, both retail and wholesale demand has gone down a bit and you can really relate that to the slowdown of the steel industry there. But all in all, even with all those effects, I think the quality of our business improved significantly over the last year. Does that answer your question?
Laurence Alexander: Thank you.
Corning Painter: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Susan from KeyBanc. Caller, you line is open, please go ahead. [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time, back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much. With that, I would like to thank everybody for being on the call. Thanks for taking time from your busiest schedule to listen to our presentation. We appreciate your interest and we look forward to discussing our results with you again next quarter. Have a very nice day and all the best, thank you.
Operator: And that will conclude today’s conference, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Air Products & Chemicals' Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Simon R. Moore - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thank you, Angela. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' second quarter 2016 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President & CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release. Seifi and Scott will talk more about the decision to exit Energy-from-Waste, which we announced a few weeks ago. The quarterly results we are sharing today and the prior-period comparisons have been restated to reflect moving the Energy-from-Waste segment to discontinued operations. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedules to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President, responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products' Executive Vice President, in charge of our Materials Technology business now called Versum. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. I am very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite sluggish economic growth worldwide and currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on our five-point strategic plan and delivered $1.82 per share of earnings, which is up 17% over last year and on a constant currency basis, our EPS is up 20% versus last year. Another quarter of outstanding performance is due entirely to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' talented, committed, and motivated employees around the world. I once again want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward, so that they can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal. Please go to slide number three, we always start our internal meetings with a discussion on safety. And I want to do the same today in our presentation to you. Our quarter two performance in safety was better than last year and did improve relative to our disappointing first quarter performance. So I'm pleased that we are moving in the right direction. However, the only acceptable goal is zero accidents, and we have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure that everybody goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee. Now, please turn to slide number four, which is the restatement of our overall goal for the company. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side, and I'm confident we can focus and improve our performance on the safety side. Now, please turn to slide number five, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize it again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company. Now, please turn to slide number six, our five-point plan. Our strong performance this quarter and in the previous quarters is a direct result of our focus on our five-point strategic plan that we announced a year-and-a-half ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter and I would like to just make a few more comments. The first point of this plan was to focus on industrial gases, our core business. And therefore, divest of our non-core businesses. In September 2015, we announced plans to spin-off our Material Technology business tax-free to our shareholders and set it up as a separate public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form 10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and have since updated that and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work necessary to implement this plan. But most importantly, Guillermo and the Material Technologies team are delivering very strong results quarter after quarter. We are on track to complete the separation of this business from our core by the end of September 2016 and will continue to evaluate whether debt and equity market conditions are favorable for a spin-off. The second non-core business is Energy-from-Waste, Scott will take you through the details. But as a result of the decision to exit this business last month, we have taken a pre-tax charge of almost $1 billion this quarter primarily to write-down assets associated with the Energy-from-Waste business to their realizable value. The fourth-point of our plan is the responsible use of cash and eliminating unnecessary work. We have a very robust process to review every capital investment of more than $3 million and have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue, and earnings growth over the next few years. Our backlog is down this quarter because we successfully brought on-stream the new hydrogen plant in Canada serving Shell and the local pipeline system there. As I have mentioned previously, I remain very optimistic about the growth potential of our core Industrial Gases business, especially opportunities in larger scale on-site oxygen and hydrogen plants. In the area of restructuring, the actions we took last year to eliminate unnecessary work have already reduced our overhead by $300 million a year and you're seeing the benefits of these efforts in our results. We are making great progress on our plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational savings in the next four years through self-help measures, including plant operations, distribution, sourcing and overhead costs. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward so that we can stay at the leading edge of our industry. Now, please turn to slide number seven for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details, but I wanted to emphasize that we improved EBITDA margin by over 500 basis points versus last year, increased our earning per share by 17%, and, most importantly, our return on capital employed is now up 200 basis points to 13%. Our restructuring actions enabled us to deliver these strong results despite the weak worldwide economy and continued currency headwind. Also, please note that this is the seventh consecutive quarter that we have delivered double-digit earnings per share growth. And now, if you please turn to my very favorite slide, slide number eight, you will see our progress over the last two years where we have improved our margins by 1,000 basis points. Yes, 1,000 basis points. And during this same two years timeframe, our earning per share is up 37%. This single chart is a great demonstration of how focused the Air Products team is and we are determined to continue to improve our profitability. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our quarterly results in detail. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you very much, Seifi. For our second quarter, sales of $2.3 billion decreased 6% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 3% each. Volumes were unchanged as Gases-Asia growth continued, while other segment volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later. Pricing rounded down to zero but was just slightly positive driven by price increases in Gases-Americas and Gases-Europe. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $797 million improved by 12%, and operating income of $532 million improved by 20% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 560 basis points to 35.1%, while our operating margin improved 500 basis points to 23.4%. We saw margin improvements across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 40 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 460 basis points resulted primarily from the benefit of the restructuring actions we have taken and a smaller benefit from price versus raw materials. Our actions continue to show results, and this is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Versus prior year, net income and earnings per share grew 18% and 17%, respectively. And we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 200 basis points to 13% on our higher profitability. As Simon mentioned previously, Energy-from-Waste has been moved to discontinued operations and is not included in these numbers. Now please turn to slide 10. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by about $50 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA. I want to point out that for consistency, we've restated the prior year's growth CapEx to exclude Energy-from-Waste. As a result of the higher EBITDA and the lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $220 million this quarter and $121 million higher than last year. Just as a reminder, from a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes. Turning to slide number 11, we've included some additional information regarding our decision to exit the Energy-from-Waste business that we announced earlier this month. The decision to exit the business and stop efforts to startup and operate our Energy-from-Waste projects was based on continued difficulties encountered in starting up the first project. Based on extended testing and analysis completed this past quarter, significant additional time and resources would've been required to make the projects operational. In addition, the decision allows us to execute our strategy of focusing resources on our core Industrial Gases business. As a result of this decision, the Energy-from-Waste segment has been moved to discontinued operations, and prior year information has been restated for comparison purposes. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $946 million during fiscal Q2. This loss includes $914 million to write down the plant assets to their estimated salvage value of $20 million. The charge also includes $32 million for plant disposition and severance costs. The projects are located on leased land that requires removal of the facility. It is expected that dismantlement of the facility will be completed in fiscal 2017. As a result of removing this asset value from the denominator, ROCE increases by approximately 100 basis points. Additional exit costs estimated at $50 million to $100 million may be recorded in future periods to wind down the plant and settle the remaining purchase contracts. We are also still evaluating an ASU built primarily to serve the Energy-from-Waste site. Its current book value is approximately $60 million and is in our Gases-EMEA segment. There is no change to our continuing operations book effective tax rate. There will be a modest cash tax benefit totaling about $75 million to $100 million that we expect to recognize over the next 10-plus years. In terms of future uses of cash, we see a potential net cash cost of $60 million to $110 million for the various items mentioned above. However, as we've said, we are working to optimize the cash value of our investment. Turning now to slide number 12, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q2 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.08 per share, or $19 million pre-tax. We incurred Materials Technologies' separation costs of $7 million, or $0.04 per share primarily for legal and other advisory fees. As I mentioned last quarter, we have completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. We are now focused on the second $300 million of operational improvements. In Q2, we incurred a $9 million, or $0.03 per share charge associated with these actions. We also recorded a $3 million or $0.01 per share pension settlement charge. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.82 increased $0.26 per share, or 17% versus last year. The impact from lower volumes decreased EPS by $0.10 per share primarily due to a positive prior year contract wrap up in global gases and a lower LNG sale of equipment activity. Pricing versus raw materials taken together contributed $0.08, primarily driven by lower raw material costs. Net cost performance was $0.36 per share favorable, primarily due to the benefit of our restructuring actions taken last year and good progress on our operational improvements. Cost performance also benefited by about $0.15 from lower incentive compensation, lower pension costs, and other income and expense. Unfavorable currency was $0.05 as many currencies besides the euro weakened against the dollar. As a reminder for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Equity affiliate income was unchanged. Interest expense of $0.01 was $0.01 higher primarily due to lower capitalized interest from lower capital spending. Taxes were $0.02 unfavorable due to higher earnings. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%. Now, to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thanks, Scott. Let me start by thanking the entire Industrial Gases team around the world for delivering another very strong quarter. Despite continuing currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions, each of the regional teams delivered EBITDA margins that were up more than 500 basis points. We are focused on the things we can control, primarily driving operational productivity, and we also improved our safety performance this quarter. We have described our operational productivity opportunity as 10,000 little things, meaning we have many opportunities to act and drive improvement. As an example, we have a large network of plants that produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon; LOX, LIN and LAR. Many of them also serve pipeline customers like steel mills. As pipeline customer demand swings and local power rates shift, the availability and cost of liquid product changes, too. We are working with third-party providers including outside distribution experts to modernize our sales and operations planning process and tools to help us to reliably serve our customers for the lowest cost every day. With that, please turn to slide 13 for a review of our Gases-Americas' first quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on restructuring actions and self-help measures drove the significant margin expansion. Sales of $798 million were down 10% versus last year, as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 6%, and currency reduced sales by 3%. Volumes were down 2% primarily driven by weakness in Latin America. We also continued to see lower oilfield service demand versus last year, although we'll begin to lap that decline next quarter. Steel remains weak. We haven't yet seen any improvement to speak of in our customers' operations. Although HyCO volumes were down slightly on modest customer outages, underlying demand remained strong. Pricing was up versus prior year for the sixth consecutive quarter with a key focus on recovering inflation in South America. Volumes were down sequentially primarily in South America seasonality. Operating income of $224 million was up 23%, and EBITDA of $341 million was up 14% versus last year, as the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs more than overcame headwinds from lower volumes, currency and lower energy pass-through. Record operating margin of 28.1% was up 770 basis points, and record EBITDA margin of 42.8% was up over 900 basis points. Lower energy pass-through, accounted for only about 100 basis points of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 670 basis points excluding lower energy pass-through. Finally, we are pleased to bring onstream our newest 150 million standard-cubic-foot-a-day hydrogen plant located in Scotford, Northeast of Edmonton in Alberta. This new steam methane reformer provides hydrogen and steam to Shell Canada's Scotford facility and will supply hydrogen to Northwest's refinery. The plant is connected to our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline system that is also fed by two hydrogen plants in Edmonton and supplies refiners, upgraders, chemical processors and other industries. As this plant came onstream right at the end of the quarter, it did not contribute to our Q2 results. Now please turn to slide 14. For the Europe, Middle East and Africa business, we continue to see our restructuring and pricing actions more than offsetting volume weaknesses as EBITDA and operating margins again set new records, both up over 500 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $420 million were down 6% due to a negative currency impact of 3% and a negative 4% impact from lower energy pass-through. Underlying sales were up 1%, as 2% higher prices more than offset 1% lower volumes. We have not really seen much demand improvement in Europe, but continue to work hard on price increases, delivering our fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricings. Operating income of $89 million was up 26%, and EBITDA of $145 million was up 14%, as our restructuring and price actions more than offset headwinds from currency and lower volumes. Record operating margin of 21.3% was up over 500 basis points, and record EBITDA margin of 34.5% was up over 600 basis points. Lower energy pass-through accounted for about 50 basis points of that, meaning that the operating margin was up 500 basis points, excluding lower energy pass-through. Please turn to slide 15, Gases-Asia. Volume growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions drove significant margin improvement over last year. Sales of $406 million were up 3%, primarily driven by volumes up 10%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency primarily from China, Korea, and Taiwan. Overall merchant volumes were up high-single digits both across Asia and in China specifically. We continue to see the benefits of large, on-site plan projects we brought onstream over the last year, as well as an increase in energy pass-through revenue at a few of these recently started up plants. Our coal gasification customers in China continue to operate their facilities at high rates. Our plants continue to run well. And most importantly, we continue to get paid. Pricing was down 1%, reflecting a reduced rate of decline in LOX, LIN and LAR pricing despite the substantial overcapacity in China. Operating income of $104 million was up 23%, and EBITDA of $170 million was up 18%, as our restructuring actions and stronger volumes more than offset the headwinds from currency and price. Operating margin of 25.7% was up over 400 basis points. And EBITDA margin of 41.9% was up over 500 basis points. We did see a sequential decline in profits driven by about $5 million of positive non-recurring items last quarter, currency, and the expected lower merchant volumes during the Lunar New Year. I would add that it seems that our customers' Lunar New Year outages this year were fairly typical relative to previous years, and we didn't see them taking extended outages. I'll close with a brief comment on Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business which are not region specific. Sales were up as we recognized about $30 million of revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment and that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. However, we did not recognize any profits this quarter from Jazan as we are still early in the project. Costs in this segment were down, but profits were down as the prior-year quarter had a non-recurring benefit from a contract wrap-up. Now, please turn to slide 16, and I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology: Thank you, Corning. The Materials Technology team delivered another strong quarter. As I shared with you during our February Versum conference call, we believe we've made structural and sustainable improvements to our business, which you can see from this graph of the margin improvement over the last three years. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts: innovation, focusing on our key products and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions. While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven in part by end market changes, we do not see this as a cyclical business. Turning to slide 17 on this quarter's results, segment sales of $490 million, were down 7% versus last year. Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems in electronics and lower additives and epoxy demand in Performance Materials. EBITDA of $150 million was up 1% and operating income of $129 million was up 4% as price/raw material management, mix and our restructuring actions more than offset headwinds from lower volumes and currency. As a result, EBITDA margins of 30.2%, was up 240 basis points and operating margin of 26.2% was up almost 300 basis points, both representing another quarterly record. In October, I told you that we expected to deliver higher profits in 2016 than in 2015 and we are well on our way. Through two quarters, our EBITDA is up about $20 million higher than last year. We remain confident on our outlook for 2016 and are working to continue to deliver improved profits in the second half of the year. On slide 18, you can see the results for Electronic Materials. Sales of $234 million were down 10% on lower volumes while higher pricing offset negative currency effect. As expected, delivery systems activity was down significantly compared to high level of project activity last year. Overall Materials volumes were roughly flat as we continued to see growth in our Advanced Materials business, partially offset by weakness in our Taiwan foundry customers. For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $83 million was down 1% and operating income of $70 million was up 4% versus last year. EBITDA margins of 35.5% were up over 300 basis points and operating margins of 30.1% was up 400 basis points. Pricing and mix and the benefit of our restructuring actions were the key drivers, more than offsetting currency headwinds. On slide 19, you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $261 million were down 5% on 2% lower volumes, 2% lower prices and 1% negative currency effect. Epoxy volumes were down on weakness in oil and gas and marine coatings. Additive volumes were also impacted by oil and gas weakness, as well as mining, including a specific customer temporary site shutdown in Brazil. We did see stronger polyurethane additives volumes across all market segments. Overall, prices were down, given broader petrochemical-driven deflation, but were more than offset by lower raw material costs. For Performance Materials, EBITDA of $67 million was up 1% and operating income of $60 million was up 2%. EBITDA margins of 25.8% and operating margins of 22.8% were both up 160 basis points primarily driven by mix improvement and favorable price/raw material balance. On slide 20, you can see the updated trailing 12-month results for Materials Technology segment. Sales of over $2 billion, EBITDA of $591 million with margins of 29.3% and operating income of $504 million with margins of 25%. This is as reported within Air Products so it does not include any allocated corporate costs. As you can see, our results continue to demonstrate that Versum Materials is a very high-quality business with very attractive margins. Our team remains focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a quick comment on our Corporate segment.
Simon R. Moore - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, Guillermo. Our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which are not business specific. Sales were down versus last year on lower LNG project activity. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancelations this quarter. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY 2016 and FY 2017 results. Profits were up despite lower sales driven by lower costs. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Simon. Now please turn to slide number 21 for a discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team is focused on implementing our five-point strategic plan to move us forward to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earning per share of $1.87 to $1.92. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.24 or 14% over the third quarter of last year and would represent our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit earning growth that we have delivered. Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background but based on our strong focus on self-help measures, we are increasing our full year fiscal 2016 guidance to $7.40 to $7.55 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.88, or 13% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance and is $0.10 higher than the guidance we gave you in October. We now expect our CapEx to be about $1.2 billion for the year, down about 30% from fiscal year 2015. As you can see from our results, we improved our free cash flow by over $120 million this quarter. As a reminder, our priorities for the use of cash remain as follows: number one, maintaining our A credit rating; number two, investing in good projects and accretive acquisitions; number three, continuing to increase our dividends; and number four, finally, if and only if there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks. At the end of the day, the cash that we generate belongs to the shareholders and we will only spend our cash if we have enough high return projects or good acquisitions. And now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: And we'll take our first question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I was curious in the margin improvement chart over the last couple of years. Can you tease out of that how much was just simply from lower electricity costs?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Probably hardly anything. Almost nothing.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: And we'll now go to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just curious to how much your FX headwind has changed for the full year this quarter versus last quarter.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Scott will answer the question, please.
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes. Hi, Vincent. Good morning. When we came out of last quarter and we always just project currencies to stay where they were. At the end of last quarter, we would have said that for the year, FY 2016 versus prior year, our currency headwinds would have been $0.20, maybe $0.25. Now as we close this quarter and again move the currency sideways, our current view is that year-on-year, FY 2016 versus 2015, is about a $0.15 headwind. So, net-net, we've got about another $0.05 less year-on-year headwind from currency. So hopefully I was clear on that. I'll point out also that the driver of that is all the various currencies. The euro now has mitigated a little bit, so when you look at our rules of thumb, it's also been, not only the major ones like the euro and the RMB that we've given you in the past, but also areas where we're smaller but we've seen quite a bit of movement in the currencies like the real, Korean won and Canadian dollar and so forth.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, could you then – if FX is about $0.05 better off to bottom, what's the balance of the guidance increase? Is it broad-based or is it coming from particular regions?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It is broad based, but it is primarily driven by our delivering the second $300 million of self-help measures that we have planned for.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Vincent.
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Vincent.
Operator: We will now go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, David.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Excellent job on the margins. Just on the pricing component there, you've announced a series of price increases over the past year. How would you rate the success of those price increases and what's the impact do you think going forward?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would like to have both Corning and Guillermo comment on that with their respective businesses. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yes. Thank you. So I think you can see kind of in our results the progress that we've made thus far in our pricing. We typically only announce pricing increases in North America that affect some contracts more than others. But you can see we've had broad-based success in pricing, particularly in Europe, South America as well. So if you come down to it, if you ask me, this really turns on if you go back to the concept of focus on the core. So that we focus on gases, we give the customers good service, we earn the right to raise the price increases, and we've got a self-confident and motivated team that goes out and gets it, and I see that trend continuing for us.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Guillermo?
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology: Yes. If you look at pricing in the materials space, the three big drivers that we focus on is one is value pricing. That's about technology and innovation and how we improve the overall mix of our business, and that's been going very well. Our innovation engine is doing well, and mix improvement has been a good driver of our margin improvement and growth. I think the second driver is just competitive dynamics. Where we are in different markets, if you look at all the actions we've taken on the portfolio side and our cost actions, we are in a much more competitive position and that's allowed us to play a much more offensive game in terms of both volumes and pricing in those kinds of segments. And the last segment for us is mostly around our functional surfactants, and that's more formula-based pricing where the raw materials do have a component. So we've had a favorable lag effect as we look through that pricing overall, but all three of those areas have been performing very well for us.
Operator: Thank you...
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very good. And just last thing, Seifi, in Gases – Americas on volume, when do you think volume can turn positive in this segment? Is it Q3, is it Q4, or is it even later?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Look, David, the famous saying is that it's very difficult to make predictions if it is about the future. So we do not have that kind of a visibility to be able to predict that. That's why in our forecast and the guidance, we are assuming flat volumes. I don't want to venture into predicting that because we really don't know.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology: Thanks, David.
Operator: We will now go to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Perfect. Thank you very much. Just turning back to the Industrial Gas side, can you just comment on your current expectations on industry price discipline actually particularly in Europe and then in the U.S. and whether or not you've seen any improvements over the last six to 12 months. Just any expectations going forward would be appreciated. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: So I'm sorry but no, I really cannot comment on what I think discipline would be in this industry. I could really only talk about our own actions on pricing, which I've already really shared.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Guys, you know we don't comment on pricing. It's not appropriate.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sorry. Thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: We will now go to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Duffy.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Hi, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wanted to ask a couple questions on China. They've come out and talked about the oversupply that they have in the steel industry and about potentially moving to some consolidation there. Obviously as a big supplier into that industry, are you seeing that? Do you think there's a chance that they take off meaningful capacity in steel?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Duffy, we are beginning to see that and we are seeing that people are taking it off. I'd like – Corning is closer to this thing day to day. Both of us were in China. So we can give you some comments on this. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yes. So I think, overall, our exposure to the China end-market is relatively small, our steel end-market that is. And there's really a potential upside in this. So for a long time, the CPC, the Communist Party of China, has talked about rationalizing the steel mills. And many of these smaller regional steel mills have their own captive air separation plants. They make liquid product. They basically dump that into the market space. So more recently, there's been more serious talk out of Beijing about this, and there's been more talk of setting up funds aside to help the social transition associated with this. And I would say we begin to see that happening right now and our steel prices are now up a little bit, so we'll have to see. But, all in all, I see this as a rational and positive development.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Corning.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then, Seifi, a question for you. We've seen some noise out of the Middle East about players there wanting to raise capital, whether it's Aramco talking about potentially an IPO. One way for them to raise capital would be if they're willing to dispose of their either hydrogen plants or air separation units to a western player. Is that an opportunity for the industrial gas industry to buy assets away from the big Middle Eastern players who are trying to raise capital.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Duffy, that's an excellent question. I don't want to speak for the industry, but that is an excellent opportunity for Air Products. They have identified that as an area that we are going to be very aggressive about, and I think that would be a very positive development in our growth. That's one of the reasons we are optimistic about our growth. And as you know, we have organized ourselves now, we have a President for that part of the world. We have strengthened our team there, and we are very active in that area. Yes.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Duffy.
Operator: We will now to go Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate your unwillingness to forecast things, so I'll ask you to look far enough out that you can't be held to it. But I'm trying to get a sense; volumes have been pretty pathetic in the industry for a while here. Obviously, your earnings growth has been spectacular, mainly a function of self-help. When you get to a steady-state, what do you see as sort of the waterfall between sustainable revenue growth, EBIT growth and then ultimately EPS growth, let's say, on a three-year, five-year, seven-year or longer time horizon that takes out the near-term noise?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, Bob, thanks very much for the question. I can certainly make some comments on that. Number one, you know our industry very well. I'd like to distinguish between two parts. One is our merchants and packaged gases business and our onsite business. The merchant and packaged gas businesses in this industry has always and will continue to grow with industrial production. There is no change on that. There is no change in the industry. If you are focused on packaged gases and liquids and you try to move your portfolio towards that as some of our competitors are doing, you're going to be stuck with growth with industrial production, whatever it is. So there's no change in the industry. Where we see significant opportunities for Air Products, because that is our core competency and that is the biggest part of our portfolio, it is on the big onsite plants. And on that front, both for hydrogen and for oxygen, we see significant opportunities for growth. That is why I think for the long term, Bob, our overall goal for Air Products is to continue to grow our earnings per share 10% a year. That's our goal. And we have delivered in the last two years and that would be our goal to continue to deliver that. And we see that as a good possibility.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And could I ask maybe Scott why the CapEx number came down a little bit and the definition of your backlog? It seems like a couple of second half projects were delineated into the fourth quarter more specifically. Could you just give us an update there?
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, sure, Bob. The reason why the CapEx came down projected for this year is really just spending for the projects that we already have in the backlog. So as we project out for the year, we get close to the end of the year, what's the spending going to be for those projects, that's why we moved it down. The other thing in terms of the backlog, you'll note that we did bring on, as we mentioned, a big project up in Canada. And that's the biggest reason why our backlog has come down from $2.4 billion down to $2.1 billion.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: If I may just add, the project that you're talking about in Canada is not a small project. It's about $400 million. So that has a significant effect on reducing that backlog.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Terrific. Thanks for the help.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bob.
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: We will now go to John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. If you're able to reach an agreement with Evonik on Performance Materials, what would you do with Electronic Materials?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'm not sure what you're talking about. We haven't reached any agreement with anybody and I do not want to speculate about market rumors. So, sorry John, I can't comment on that.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Maybe I'll try one for Scott. Scott, now that you give us quarterly maintenance capital, is there a way that we can connect that to the EBITDA impact from maintenance? I would assume that the effect would at least be directionally similar that if you spend less CapEx in a quarter on maintenance, the EBITDA impact from the maintenance activity would probably be less.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. There is no connection there. This is Seifi.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: What we are disclosing to you is maintenance CapEx that is totally different than maintenance expense. Our maintenance expense is to upkeep our plant so that they keep running and serve our customers. We have not had any cutback on that. We are totally focused on that. The maintenance CapEx is basically a function of replacing old assets that need to be replaced, and that is what we are reporting. So there is no real connection between the two.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, John.
Operator: We will now go to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Jeffrey Michael Schnell - Jefferies LLC: Hi. This is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Can you give a longer-term view of the backlog? That is do you think that this is a good run rate that will be stable over the next three to four years or should it continue to decline? And then when you look at the the biz (53:09) you're working on now, has there been any shift in regional trends?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: With respect to our projections, obviously, it depends on the projects. But we can certainly see a situation there. Our capital expenditure will be somewhere between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion a year. In terms of regions, the areas with the greatest opportunity is the United States Gulf Coast because of low natural gas and significant potential in China. In addition to that, there is opportunities on the area that I was asked a question about in the Middle East and all of that. That's an additional opportunity. So that's where we see that. There are projects in other parts of the world, like people wanting to replace an old ASU in Europe and so on. But the major projects are definitely in China and in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Jeffrey Michael Schnell - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In EMEA, your underlying price is up and that was encouraging to see. Can you talk about utilization in Europe and other areas, other regions of the world?
Simon R. Moore - Vice President, Investor Relations: I'm sorry. I didn't quite sure I understood. You observed the pricing trend in Europe and your question was?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): The question was, can you talk about utilization in Europe and also in other parts of the world where the margin utilization is?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Either one of us can answer that. That's easy. It is about the same. We are still at around 77%, 78% utilization in the U.S., Europe and in China. I don't think there's any significant difference. Corning, do you want to add to that?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: No. I would just say if you're talking about where there's a little more momentum towards loading, obviously that's in China where you can see the volume movement.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then Seifi, you talked about accelerating your cost-cutting plans if the economy slowed down. And from your phase two of the cost cutting, can you talk about what is your latest thinking on that cost-cutting program and the cadence of that cost cutting? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, thank you very much for the question. We still believe that we are on track to deliver that second $300 million in the four years. This will be the first year. Therefore, by the end of the year, we'll be at a run rate of $75 million which means that this year, we'll deliver at least $35 million, $36 million, $40 million, half of that, and we are well on our way in doing that. We are doing actually better than we thought we will be doing, and that's one of the reasons we increased our guidance for the year.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thanks, P.J.
Operator: We will now go to Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Hi, Mike.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Corning, you mentioned that maintenance cost in the Americas was lower this quarter. How much lower was it year-on-year, and what's your expectations for Q3 and Q4 compared to this quarter?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. So, the maintenance reduction for us in this quarter was about $0.04 for us. Going forward, we're going to expect that to trend up, and that's in our forecast for the next – that we've put out for the next quarter and the full year.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: And then, I guess, I was a little bit surprised to hear you say that North America was still weak in terms of steel market. Are you starting to see any change with the impact of the tariffs that were put in place in the U.S.? And can you also comment on whether any change there would lead to potential loosening of supply and demand in argon supply?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. Good question. So, a couple of things. Number one, I think, it's sort of hard to talk about regional economic trends. It is so specific what's happening in one segment versus another. And even in North America steel, if you're making steel that goes into a car, you're doing great. If you're making tube, you're not doing well. So, we, in fact, have two mills that are down. I mean, they pay their BFC (57:51), but they're down. If they were to restart, right, and the economy picked up, that would be positive. Yes, it would make more argon. But probably, in that same environment, we'd see demand for stainless steel increase. And stainless steel takes a lot of argon. So, I personally think the argon market in the U.S. is going to remain relatively tight through this transition here.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. And if I can just sneak one last one in. On the equity affiliates income in Americas, it seemed to have come quite a bit lower from where it generally is. Is there a reason for that?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. We just had some maintenance in one of our equity affiliates in Americas. So that's all, it's just timing items, nothing substantive and underlying.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: We'll now go to Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you would give us your view on the outlook for hydrogen over the next couple of years. Obviously, you're one of the biggest producers there is. With the amount of ethylene capacity coming online in the U.S. Gulf Coast that should increase hydrogen supply, but then of course there's perhaps limited refinery, limited refinery growth. So, I was just curious what your supply demand outlook is for hydrogen?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: It is very positive. We see growth around the world, not just the U.S. and we are a global supplier. We are number one. We are the leader in this area. And therefore, as you see, we are bringing on big plans onstream, so we are very positive. And Corning, you want to make any additional comments?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah, maybe just to acknowledge. So even today on our large pipeline system, we have some hydrogen sources where we're off taking for a customer. And so to the extent hydrogen is available, that's an opportunity for us to bring it in. I think another reality is that a lot of this hydrogen is going to be consumed at that customer and a lot of it's going to be used for fuel value.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Understood. And so given this positive outlook on hydrogen, would you expect that to be a greater proportion of your backlog going forward?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: I don't think that's going to significantly change the picture.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Understood. Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We will now go to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. On your comments on Versum timing, you said that you're watching the credit and equity markets closely. What alternatives have you explored in case markets are unfavorable for a spin at the end of September?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I would have to say just about any option that you can imagine. We have looked at everything. That's our job, to look at these options.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, Seifi, on your comments on the growth potential of industrial gases, you're very optimistic. Can you talk about the sentiment of your customers right now? Are any of them as optimistic as you are? Are they getting closer to pulling the trigger?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the customers that I'm talking about in terms of growth are the very large demand for oxygen and hydrogen. Those customers we have talked to, I told you I was just in China in the last two weeks with Corning and the rest of our people. Those customers have big plans. I'm very optimistic about what they want to do.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: We will now go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice quarter.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I wanted to include Guillermo a little bit. When you think about your volume growth here for Electronic Materials, you said it was flat ex-delivery. So are you seeing growth in all the key products of Advanced Materials, and any growth in Processed Materials as well?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: By the way, thank you for grilling him. I appreciate that. Go ahead, Guillermo.
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology: Thanks for the question. Now, if you look at our Advanced Materials, we're seeing – obviously it varies by segment. The memory market has continued to be very strong and our projections are that that is still going to continue to be a growth area for us. Volumes are holding up. Obviously that segment is getting impacted more on pricing from our – on our customer side, the pricing of DRAM and NAND, but overall volumes are still good, and we're very well-positioned with a lot of the new technologies, process of record for the next generation. So, that's doing very well. On the Process Materials, our volumes are holding up. We've been capacity-constrained, so some of the fluctuations in the markets haven't been as big of an impact to us, although we did see a slowdown in the early part of the quarter and a pickup in the backend of the quarter because of the Taiwan earthquake and just softness in the foundry market. But we're bringing on new capacity, and as the memory market continues to grow, we expect the demand to continue.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then one long-term question is, and I think you kind of mentioned is, OEMs consider moving from 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer sometime in 2017. How much of an opportunity is that for you? What does your products do to help them move down that node?
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology: Well, two comments I would make. One is it's not just that they're going to smaller nodes and higher technology. In general, that requires new materials, new processes, and that is what's driving our formula for growth traditionally. So that's something that has not changed. What is changing now is also that a lot of the structures are going vertical. And so you can think about if they had 25 layers before, now you have 50 layers – had 50 layers. They have 100 layers. So the amount of material used and the steps are getting much more complex, and you just use a lot more. So if you think NF3 as an example in the clean business, now you have more steps. You have more cleaning steps, demand is going up, and that's what's driven a lot of the volume growth on the material side. So from a materials perspective, the next-generation nodes, materials are going to be a much bigger driver and enabler for the newer technologies, and that's a good thing for our space.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will now go to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks very much. In general, industrial production in the United States has moved down from the fourth calendar quarter of 2015, and it keeps dropping. And Europe is a little bit different where there's some upward movement in industrial production. So, is it the case in general that your U.S. industrial gas business on the margin going into the next quarter is weakening a little bit and the European business is strengthening a little bit?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: So, it's Corning. A couple of – let me kind of speak to each one of those separately.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sure.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: I would say in the Americas, if you strip out oilfield services, you strip out steel and you try to look at the core customers, right, the customers who were with you a year ago, are they with you now? Do those customers have volume momentum? Yes, they do. And that's kind of my point. I think, it's hard to talk about a global macro statement. I think it's much more useful to think about individual segments. In Europe, I'd say in general, it's a weak environment. It's a little hard to say in that this quarter included Easter and a year ago, it was in the third quarter. It was in April. So, I think, we're going to have to see what the actual trend turns out to be for us in Europe.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then as my follow-up, in terms of Versum, order of magnitude, is the probability that it's 75% that you'll spin it and 25% that you'll sell the individual pieces, or is there a different probability?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Jeff, you need to let me off the hook on trying to answer that question, please. I mean, I cannot speculate on that. I think that would be very premature. Sorry about that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: We'll now go with Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Good morning. This is Emily Wagner on for Don. We had a question on coal gasification units you mentioned were running well in the quarter. In terms of future coal gasification projects in China, do you see the government allowing more projects, or might they limit that opportunity due to coal emissions?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, from what I see, there are significant number of these projects on the drawing board, and some of them are getting approval from the government. So, from where we are, it looks very positive.
Emily Wagner - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I think with that I would like to thank everybody for being on the call. Once again, thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to listen to our presentation. We do appreciate your interest, and we look forward to discussing our results with you in the next quarter. I hope you have a very nice day, and all the best.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Dede. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' first quarter 2016 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Vice President of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our Web site at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in Air Products. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for industrial gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of our material technologies business. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. I am very pleased to report that Air Products delivered another set of excellent results this quarter. Despite significant global macro uncertainty and currency headwinds, our team stayed focused on our five-point plan and delivered earnings of $1.78 per share, which is up 15% over last year. Another quarter of outstanding performance is due to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products' 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees around the globe. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward so that we can be the best industrial gas company in the world. That is our goal. However, I am disappointed with one aspect of our performance. Please turn to slide number 3. Our safety performance this quarter was worse than previous years and, therefore, it is not acceptable. Our goal includes being the safest industrial gas company in the world. We have a responsibility to our employees and their families to ensure everyone goes home every day with no injuries or accidents. At Air Products, safety is the responsibility of every single employee and I have made it very clear to everyone that our safety performance must improve. Now please turn to slide number 4, which is the restatement of our goal. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress on the profitability side and I'm confident we will refocus and improve our performance on the safety side. Now please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy that we have shared with you many times before, but I would like to emphasize again. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long-term is the increase in per-share value of our stock, not the size of our company or growth rates. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most responsible -- most important responsibilities as the CEO of the company. Now please turn to slide number 6, our strategic plan as we move forward. Our strong performance this quarter is a direct result of the focus on our five-point plan that we discussed and disclosed more than a year ago. I reviewed our progress last quarter, but wanted to make a few more comments. The first point in our plan is to focus on industrial gases, our core business. In September of 2015, we announced plans to spin off our material technologies business tax free to our U.S. shareholders and set it up as a separate standalone public company called Versum Materials. We submitted our initial draft Form-10 in December to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the team is making great progress on the significant amount of work to prepare for this spin. Most importantly, Guillermo and the material technology team are delivering very strong performance. We remain confident this transaction will be complete before September of 2016. The fourth point of our plan was the responsible use of cash and controlling our cost. In this area, we have made excellent progress. We had a very robust and detailed process for reviewing every capital investment of more than $3 million at the corporate level and we have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects. We also have a strong backlog of projects that will deliver volume, revenue, and earnings growth over the next few years. In the area of cost savings, we have reduced our overhead costs by $300 million per year already and have a detailed plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational cost savings in the next four years. Corning will share with you some examples of the great work the organization has been doing to begin to deliver on the second $300 million. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are all committed to as we move forward so then we can stay at the leading edge of our industry. Now please turn to slide number 7 for a summary of our results for the quarter. Scott will take you through the details later, but I want to emphasize that the improved EBITDA margin by 500 basis points increased free cash by $200 million, increased our earnings per share by 15% and return on capital employed is up 160 basis points to 11.7%. This is despite a weak worldwide economy, lower sales and a $0.08 negative impact from currency exchange translation. And now if you please turn to slide number 8, which by the way is my favorite slide. You will see our progress over the last two years where we have improved our margins by more than 800 basis points. We are determined to continue to improve our margins. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to discuss our quarterly results. Then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much, Seifi. Please turn to slide 9 for a review of our Q1 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 8% versus last year on unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts of 5% each. Volumes increased 1% as Gases Asia growth continued, while Material Technologies and Gases Americas and Gases Europe volumes were lower. Corning and Guillermo will discuss more on that later. Pricing was 1% higher for the fifth consecutive quarter, again driven by price increases in Gases Americas and Gases Europe and both price increases and mix in Material Technologies. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA of $786 million improved by 9% and operating income improved by 17% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 520 basis points to 33.4%, while operating margin improved 460 basis points to 22%. We saw margin improvements across all segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 60 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 400 basis points resulted primarily from lower costs and higher prices. Our actions continued to show results and this quarter is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years versus prior year net income and earnings per share grew 15%. And we continued to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 160 basis points to 11.7%. Now please turn to slide 10. You have heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased by $88 million this quarter due to higher EBITDA and slightly lower maintenance capital. We remain focused on spending the right amount of maintenance capital at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. As a result of lower growth capital spending, free cash flow was $165 million this quarter, or $199 million higher than prior year. That's a great start to fiscal 2016. We expect growth CapEx for FY16 to be lower than our initial guidance, primarily due to the decision last quarter to suspend construction on the Tees Valley II projects. Please remember that, from a timing perspective, it's not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes. Turning to slide number 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance, I would like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.11 per share or $26 million pretax. Back in November, we announced that we were suspending construction of Tees Valley II until certain design issues of Tees Valley I are better understood and can be integrated into the design of Tees Valley II. In fiscal Q1, we incurred incremental costs of $14 million, or $0.05 per share, to suspend construction activities of the second project. We expect about another $0.02 of additional costs to be incurred in the second quarter. We also saw Materials Technology separation costs of $12 million, or $0.06 per share, for legal and advisory fees. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements. With the completion of our first phase, restructuring costs were modest this quarter and are included in our underlying results. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in the appendix slide and the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $1.78 increased $0.23 per share, or 15%, versus last year despite the currency headwinds. Volumes increased EPS by $0.02 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.14. Net cost performance was $0.18 favorable, primarily due to the benefit from our actions taken last year to enable a new, more disciplined organization. Cost performance also included about a $0.03 benefit from lower pension costs. Unfavorable currency was $0.08 per share as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for Gases our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Equity affiliate income was $0.03 unfavorable. Interest expense was $0.02 lower due to higher capitalized interest and the retirement of higher-cost Indura debt last quarter. Taxes were $0.03 unfavorable due to higher earnings and timing of a few items. For the year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range, likely closer to 25%. Non-controlling interest was $0.02 favorable, due to our buy up of the remaining shares of the Indura business last quarter. And higher shares outstanding reduced EPS by $0.01. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I will turn the call over to Corning.
Corning Painter: Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for another very strong quarter and step up in our margins. Despite currency headwinds and challenging economic conditions just about everywhere, we improved overall EBITDA margin by 450 basis points year-on-year. Going forward, we're going to drive operational productivity to new heights at Air Products and we are going to work tirelessly to improve safety. In our highly-distributed business, we often describe operational productivity as 10,000 little things. That means we have many opportunities to act and our new, simpler organization is helping us to act with speed. For example, we used to have a bias to purchase on corporate global, sole-source agreements. And that's a good strategy for some things, but not everything. In our new organization an empowered regional team broke this paradigm. They decided to multi-source. That meant we could introduce low-cost local suppliers and we could select the best supplier for each location. Our other regions are replicating this and we would expect savings in the 40% range. We are also improving distribution routing and fleet efficiency by working with third parties that bring new ideas. We are improving operating and maintenance efficiency by using our data to adjust maintenance intervals and improving network efficiency by consolidating facilities. These are some of the 10,000 things. With that, please turn to slide 12 for a review of our Gases Americas first quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on cost drove the margin expansion. Sales of $836 million were down 17% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 12% and currency reduced sales by 4%. Volumes were down 3% on weakness in Latin America and in the North America steel and oilfield services markets. Some steel customers idled capacity in December, which will have some impact on argon and oxygen volumes going forward. HyCO volumes and refinery operating rates remained strong. Pricing was up 2%, the fifth consecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas. We had particular success in South America in several specific products. Helium has been a strength for us, but oversupply in helium will likely begin to weaken pricing later this year. We expect the helium market to tighten again in a few years. Operating income of $212 million was flat to last year and EBITDA of $335 million was up 1% as we overcame the headwinds from currency, lower energy pass through and lower volumes through pricing, the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs. Record operating margins of 25.3% was up 420 basis points and record EBITDA margin of 40.1% was up 700 basis points. The impact from lower energy pass-through was about half of the margin improvement. Lower costs drove our sequential profit and margin improvement. We expect volume weakness to continue in Q2, particularly for steel in Latin America, but expect our cost focus will overcome higher major maintenance costs and drive improved profitability versus last year. Now please turn to slide 13. For Europe, Middle East and Africa businesses we saw the benefit of our cost restructuring actions as EBITDA and operating margins set new records, both up almost 500 basis points versus last year, sales of $438 million were down 12% due to a negative currency impact of 10% primarily due to the euro, pound and Polish zloty and a negative 2% impact on lower energy pass-through. Underlying sales were flat with 1% lower volumes and 1% higher prices. Positive liquid bulk volumes were more than offset by lower package gases volumes, in part due to weak offshore demand and by lower refinery hydrogen demand. Price was positive across all sub-regions. Operating income of $92 million was up 13% and operating margin of 20.9% was up 470 basis points. Operating income would have been up 22% on a constant currency basis. EBITDA of $146 million was up 2% and EBITDA margin of 33.3% was up 480 basis points. The primary driver of improved profitability was our continued focus on costs and the positive contribution from our pricing actions. Please turn to slide 14, Gases Asia. As you can see from our results, our business performance was very strong again this quarter with record operating and EBITDA margins. Despite all the talk about China, we did well in China. Of course, we expect our China tonnage volumes to be up with the new plants on stream, but merchant volumes were up also again. We remain cautious about the economic outlook in Asia but are pleased with the resilience our business has demonstrated. Sales of $413 million was up 4%, primarily driven by volumes up 11%, partially offset by a negative 6% impact from currency, primarily from Korea, Taiwan and China. Overall, merchant volumes were up low double digits again across Asia, with China LOX/LIN volumes also up low double digits. We were pleased to fully bring on-stream the largest ASU project that Air Products has ever built, providing oxygen to Yankuang in Yulin, China. We now have six large oxygen for coal gasification projects on stream in China including over 20,000 tons a day of oxygen added this last year. Our customers are operating their facilities, our plants are running well, and we are getting paid. As I have mentioned in the past, we do occasionally see swings in the energy pass-through around customer startups. This has no impact on profit, but can impact sales and margins. Sequentially, volumes were down 3%, in part due to a positive catch-up payment in Q4 that I mentioned last quarter. Pricing was down 2% on the continued overcapacity in the China liquid market. Operating income of $117 million was up 29% and operating margin of 28.2% was up 550 basis points. EBITDA of $180 million was up 16% and EBITDA margin of 43.6% was up 480 basis points. Profit improvement was driven by the base business volume growth, new projects successfully coming on-stream and the benefit of our cost reduction programs and about $5 million of non-recurring items. The team is very focused on continuing to drive improvement, but we would expect some volume weakness from the Lunar New Year next quarter. I will close with a comment on Global Gases segment. You will recall that this is the segment that includes most of our air separation unit sales equipment business as well as costs associated with the industrial gas business which are not region specific. Sales were up as we began to recognize revenue from the Jazan ASU sale of equipment that more than offset weakness in small equipment and other ASU sales. Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.
Guillermo Novo: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 15. Let me start with a few general comments before I go into the numbers. In September of last year, Air Products announced its intention to separate Materials Technologies business through a spin-off to our shareholders. This strategic decision will allow Materials Technologies and Air Products Industrial Gases to leverage our respective strengths and will enable better business performance for both companies over the long-term. The new company will be called Versum Materials and will be highly profitable with strong cash flow generation and solid growth prospects. Our team is very excited about this tremendous opportunity and as you can see from our strong results, we remain focused on executing our strategy while driving safety, business improvement and taking care of our customers. We are also making good progress on key steps required to enable the spin-off, which we expect to be completed before September of 2016. For example, in December we submitted the initial draft of our Form-10. On February 24, George Bitto, Versum's future CFO, Simon, and I plan to host a conference call to help you understand our business including our key markets, products, as well as our plans for future success. Given the progress we have made in the spin-off process and the level of financial information we have provided, you will see we are sharing more details about our business. I will first make a few comments on our overall Materials Technologies segment and then make more specific comments on Electronic Materials and Performance Materials results for the quarter. Segment sales of $490 million were down 6% versus last year, including a negative 2% currency impact. As a reminder, for Materials Technologies, currency volatility has a greater impact on our business than on the industrial gas business of Air Products. Given the global nature of our supply network, we have both translational and transactional impact from currency. More so for Performance Materials, where North America supplies a significant portion of our demand in Europe and Latin America. Volumes were down 6% on lower delivery systems in Electronics and lower demand in Performance Materials. Pricing was up 2%. EBITDA of $147 million was up 14% and EBITDA margins were up 530 basis points. Operating income of $127 million was up 22% and operating margins of 26% was up 600 basis points another record margin quarter driven by cost-reduction actions and the management of price versus raw materials. Most importantly, we bounced back very well from a softer fourth quarter. As I told you last quarter, we expect to improve our profitability and deliver higher profits in 2016 than we did in 2015 and we're still committed to this. We are off to a great start in the first quarter, but are somewhat cautious of the second quarter given the decline in the delivery systems activity that I mentioned before. And the weak macroeconomic environment impacting demand, continued currency headwinds and the impact of lower material costs on our inventories. But as you know, the second half of the year is typically the stronger part of the year for our business. On slide 16, you can see the results of Electronic Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 4% on lower volumes, improved pricing and mix and negative currency effect. As expected, delivery system activity was down significantly. Despite key products in our PM portfolio being capacity constrained, our overall Materials volumes were flat as we continue to see strong demand in advanced materials business. That is a great example of innovation that continues to be at the core of our organic growth and of the future products and solutions for our customers. For Electronic Materials, EBITDA of $96 million was up 27% and EBITDA margins of 39.2% was up almost 1,000 basis points. Operating income of $83 million was up 43% and margins of $33.9 million was up over 1,000 basis points. Pricing and mix and the benefit of our cost-reduction actions were the key drivers. The quarter also benefited from the timing impact of portfolio actions we have taken. These are worth about 200 basis points. The rest of the 800 basis point improvement is from underlying business performance. On slide 17 you can see the results of Performance Materials. Sales of $245 million were down 9% on lower volumes, lower prices and negative currency effect. Volumes were down in epoxy and additives business, driven by weak global demand in general and in particular, weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. This includes a specific customer shutdown in Brazil. Prices were down, but were more than offset by lower material costs. Performance Materials EBITDA of $51 million was down 7%, but margins of 20.9% was up 50 basis points. Operating income of $44 million was down 7%, but margins of 18% was up 30 basis points. The lower volumes and the negative impact of currency more than offset the benefits of pricing relative to raw materials and the cost-reduction actions. On slide 18, you can see the trailing 12-month results for Materials Technologies segment. Sales of just over $2 billion, EBITDA of $590 million with margins of 28.7% and operating income of almost $500 million with margins of 24.3%. This is as reported within Air Products and does not include any allocated corporate costs. As you can see, Versum Materials will be a very high-quality company with very attractive margins. Slide 19 shows the operating margin improvement in Materials Technologies over the last three years. Although recent market dynamics have been favorable for a few products, the overall performance was not driven by a cyclical peak as the business environment varied significantly over this period of time. This improvement was driven by continuous actions on multiple fronts over the last three years: innovation focusing on our key product and markets, leveraging pricing opportunities, productivity, improving our cost structure and taking needed portfolio actions. While there will be normal fluctuations in quarterly results driven in part by macroeconomic drivers, we do not see this as a cyclical business. The semiconductor industry has changed and the underlying improvements we have made in process materials is sustainable. As I indicated in the past, we are capacity constrained in several product lines and we are launching several new products in advanced materials, all of which require us to expand capacity. We continued to make good progress on the capital projects I talked about in our last two earnings calls. As you saw from the initial draft Form-10, the spending on these expansion projects increased total CapEx to about $100 million in fiscal year 2015. We expect fiscal year 2016 CapEx to be about $200 million before it drops back down to more typical levels of below $100 million for fiscal year 2017. Keep in mind that we only make these types of large capital investments every few years. In fact, the last one was eight years ago. As I said, Versum will generate very strong cash flows. We are executing and remain focused on our key priorities, safety, top-line growth, and margin enhancement and equally important, we are committed to meeting or exceeding our timeline for the spin-off of Materials Technologies business as a standalone company. I know that I can speak for the entire team that we are committing to adding value to our customers, to the success of the business and to creating an exciting and profitable future for our shareholders and the rest of our stakeholders. Again, I look forward to sharing more information with you on our call on February 24. Now, I will turn the call back over to Simon for quick comments on the corporate segment.
Simon Moore: Thanks, Guillermo. Our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container business, as well as corporate costs which are not business specific. Sales were flat versus last year as higher LNG sales were offset by lower helium container sales. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations this quarter. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY'16 results. The improved profitability this quarter was primarily driven by the higher LNG activity and the benefit of reduced corporate costs. Now I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you again, Simon. Now please turn to slide number 20 for a discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team is focused on the things we can control toward our goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.78 to $1.83. At midpoint this will be an increase of $0.26, or 16%, over the second quarter of last year and will represent our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Despite an increasingly uncertain economic background and increased currency headwinds, we are confident in delivering on and are maintaining our full-year fiscal year 2016 guidance of $7.25 to $7.50 per share. At midpoint this will be a 12% increase over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance. The full-year and quarterly guidance includes the Materials Technologies business as part of Air Products for the full 2016. Primarily as a result of our decision to suspend construction of Tees Valley II project, we now expect our CapEx to be about $1.3 billion for the year, down about 25% from fiscal year 2015. As you can see from our results, we improved free cash flow by $200 million this quarter. You have heard me talk about priorities for the use of cash we generate and I would like to reiterate them in the order of priority. Our number one priority is to maintain an A credit rating. Number two, we will use our cash to invest in good projects and good and accretive acquisitions. Number three, we will continue to increase our dividends. And number four, finally, if and only if, there is excess cash available, we are very comfortable returning money to our shareholders in the form of share buyback. The cash we generate belongs to the shareholders and we only spend our cash if we have enough high-return projects and acquisitions. Otherwise, as I have said, we would return it to our shareholders. Air Products growth into the future will not be driven by any single large event. I am confident we will deliver on our commitment to spin Material Technologies and we will resolve our Energy from Waste business in Northern England. Our future growth and profit growth will be driven by executing on the basics of our industrial gas business that is we will focus on all aspects of growth in our industrial gases. We will deliver the second $300 million of cost savings over the next few years, enabled by the more focused and accountable organization we already have in place. We will deliver on projects in our backlog and we will compete for and win new projects at high return. We certainly understand there is significant uncertainty in the world today, but we are focused on the things we control to drive improvement. We believe in self-help regardless of the external environment. The future is very bright for Industrial Gases business in general and most importantly, for Air Products. We do have an outstanding team of talented, dedicated and motivated people who are driving change and we are blessed with having a great portfolio of businesses around the world with more than 170,000 outstanding customers to serve. I'm very proud of our people, incredibly optimistic about the future of Air Products and consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team. We are now delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mr. Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Chris Evans: Good morning, everybody. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was wondering if your increasing free cash flow position changes your appetite for share repurchases going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I've just been through our priorities in terms of what we will do with the free cash. As I said, we are going to maintain our A rating. We are already there. So we don't need to spend more cash to do that. And then I said that we are going to invest in new projects. We of a lot of new projects in place and a lot of future ones that will require cash. We are focused on making good acquisitions and there are plenty of opportunities to take a look at that, but -- and we want to increase our dividend. Now after that, if we still have cash left, yes, we will buy shares, but as I said, please just take a look at our order of priorities.
Chris Evans: I would ask you then if the credit market environment, if that changes any of your thoughts about the MT spin or your expectations for what your interest expense is going to be there.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, we have said that we are going to spin Material Technologies by September of 2016. So I understand that there are difficulties right now with the credit markets and the stock market in general, but we are not about to spin Material Technologies next week or next month. So we are obviously going to monitor what is going on in the world and when the time comes, we will take everything into consideration about what we want to do.
Chris Evans: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, David. How are you?
David Begleiter: Very good. Thank you. Seifi, on pricing, trends remain positive. What's your view on potentially -- should they remain positive for the full year? And what's the potential for these trends to actually increase or accelerate going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: As I said, we are optimistic about our future. We have given you a forecast for the year, which is -- has a wide range on it, $7.25 to $7.50. So we obviously -- our goal is to make the $7.50 not the $7.25. And our self-help projects are actually delivering results. That's why we were able to beat the guidance for the first quarter, because our cost savings delivered more than what we expected. So we do remain positive.
David Begleiter: Just one more thing, Seifi. Given the combination of Air Liquide and Air Gas, can you discuss any threats or opportunities that combination might present to you in the short term or longer term?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, David, that's an interesting question and I'm at a loss about how to respond to that without hurting anybody's feelings on either side. But fundamentally, as we had always said, Airgas was not a strategic acquisition for us. We never thought it was. At the end of the day, if you take our industrial gas sales of about $8 billion, the overlap with Airgas is only about $1.5 billion, if you exclude our HyCO business and our business in Europe and Asia. So it was never a strategic thing. We don't feel that we have lost anything, but by -- there are other people going and paying an arm and a leg to buy the business. So we have to wait and see how it develops, but we certainly are focused on taking advantage of any opportunity that may arise.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, David.
Scott Crocco: Thanks David.
Operator: Next, we will go to Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Hi. I was just wondering, out of your plants in China that are in coal gasification operations, what end-markets are you most levered to? Is it polyethylene, ammonia, methanol? Some of those are not doing very well. And is the profitability of your take-or-pay contracts -- is affected by operating rates?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, as you know the nature of our business, our supply contracts have a fixed monthly charge. It is not dependent on the profitability of the customer. So whether those markets are up or down doesn't really affect our monthly fee that we get. The second thing is that most of our exposure is to coal to liquids and we don't have a lot of exposure to methanol and all of that. But I would like Corning to expand on this.
Corning Painter: I think the key thing here is they are all operating. These are plants with high fixed costs, low operating costs. We have a mix of end-markets that it goes into. We've got strong contract coverage and you can see the impact in our results. It's quite a positive for us.
Steve Byrne: But you do have an effect on operating rate? It does -- beyond the monthly fee?
Seifi Ghasemi: No, it doesn't.
Corning Painter: No, no.
Seifi Ghasemi: It doesn't. It's a fixed price. Whether a customer operates at 70%, 50%, or 90%, we get the same fee.
Steve Byrne: Okay, thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning P.J. How are you doing this morning?
P.J. Juvekar: I'm doing well. In Asia your volumes are up nicely, 11%. How much of that was base business and how much of that was any new plant start-ups that you had?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I'd like to have Corning answer that.
Corning Painter: Right. So thank you for the question. A little more than half of that is the new plant startups, and we all expect that and so forth. But nearly half of that step up is the base business, including in China, so I really think that's tremendous and speaks a lot about the resilience of the business we have there.
P.J. Juvekar: With oil prices near $30 are you seeing any project delays or cancellations in energy end-markets? I noticed that you dropped your CapEx guidance. Is that because you're going after high-return projects or is that because there is not a growth -- lack of growth opportunities or sort of combination of both?
Seifi Ghasemi: P.J., we have not seen any cancellations of the projects that we are working on. We have dropped CapEx because -- primarily because we have stopped spending money on Tees Valley II. That expenditure, P.J., was at the rate of more than $20 million a month. So that is where the saving is coming from.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Corning Painter: Thanks P.J.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Hi. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Jeff Zekauskas: Can you talk about your backlog in LNG and how much risk you think is in the business this year if you think there is risk in it?
Seifi Ghasemi: There is no risk on the business this year. The projects that we are working on are -- have not been canceled, Jeff. I think we said that at the -- Simon said that in his comments.
Jeff Zekauskas: Sure.
Seifi Ghasemi: We haven't seen any cancellation. The issue that we have is for the future projects that we were counting on, on the years to come. Those projects have been put on hold. None of them have been canceled, but they have been put on hold. So that's the part that we have to see but this year we are not at risk at all.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, for my follow-up, if you look at your industrial gas demand in Europe and in the United States, it seems to be somewhat below GDP growth. And there are all kinds of reasons why there are pressures on the industrial gas business. Has the sort of the makeup of your customer base changed so much that it's difficult for industrial gas to grow at a GDP rate now or do you see this as merely cyclical?
Seifi Ghasemi: Look, Jeff, on that one I will you an answer and then I will allow Corning to expand on that.
Jeff Zekauskas: Sure.
Seifi Ghasemi: I mean, you know, very well that the GDP in the United States, 70% of that GDP is discretionary consumer spendings. The industrial production, which our sales are related to, that one is not growing as much. So our correlation of our sales has always been with industrial production. So as a result of that, we don't see any change in our customer mix to make us believe that we will have lower growth rates as compared to the past. But, Corning, you want to make any comment?
Corning Painter: Maybe just one other insight I can add to that. I think we're in a market situation where it's maybe a little less likely to make -- useful to look at a broad, sweeping statement about a market -- Europe, North America, China in that different segments within each industrial economy are doing better and worse and have very different approaches. Even in steel you could say, well, there's overcapacity. It is impacted by lower oil, but automotive demand is quite strong. So I think we are sort of in a spiky market where some specific end-markets do better and worse than others.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Vincent Andrews: The comments you made on the Americas pricing, it sounded like you saw solid pricing in South America. I'm just wondering how much of that was sort of trying to recover currency and was that ultimately offsetting negative pricing in the United States or what's the trend as you move across the different sub geographies of the Americas?
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure, Corning?
Corning Painter: Maybe the best way to get to this question of underlying cost versus pricing is we had margin expansion, let's say from the mix of that, in both regions. Does that answer your question?
Vincent Andrews: Yes. That answers my question. Then just as a follow-up. Do you have an update on Tees Valley I to share with us?
Seifi Ghasemi: Not really, Vincent. What we have been doing with Tees Valley I is for the past year we start the plant up, learn something; the plant goes down because something goes wrong. So we're in an iterative process of trying to learn how the gasifier behaves and if we can make it work on a sustainable basis. There is a still significant outstanding question about if we will ever be able to get it to work on a sustainable basis. And as I said, we have given ourselves a few months to keep trying it, but there will come a time that we might stop trying. The technology is proving to be a lot more difficult than people thought at the beginning and I have to say we haven't made a lot of significant progress since we talked to you last time.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Thank very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And next we have John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Good morning, nice quarter.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thanks John.
John Roberts: Corning, was most of the 2% price increase in the Americas in South America? It sounded like you made a comment like that. And so we should think about that as recovering currency?
Corning Painter: We had pricing success in both North and South America. If I were going to lay this all back to underlying what's behind it, I would say, as much as anything, it is good service, which gets you the right to raise their price, combined with good discipline. Obviously, power rates and other inputs are a factor to it, but particularly to the comments I made before about margin, I think it comes down to discipline and service.
John Roberts: And then, secondly, do you still expect Versum to be as leveraged as you originally thought? Rates for higher debt companies have gone up, so I was wondering whether you are rethinking that.
Seifi Ghasemi: We will decide that finally about, quite honestly, two weeks before we actually go public and raise the debt. The markets, as you know better than I do, change just about almost on a weekly basis. So right now we have no reason to believe that we shouldn't be able to do what we have suggested before. But obviously in a few months, when we are actually going to do that, we will consult with our advisors who are already working on it and decide what is the appropriate number to put in there. We certainly, as we've always said, we are determined to set up Versum for success and we will not load it up with leverage that is inappropriate or load them up with significant interest charges that they cannot afford. But the company, as Guillermo has been explaining to you, they are doing very well and their capacity for debt is significantly even more than what we have suggested no matter what the markets. But we will make that decision right before we actually do it.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And next we have Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Harrison: Guillermo, I was wondering if you could talk about the big decline in delivery systems within Electronic Materials. Should we view that as a negative leading indicator, or can you maybe give us some color on what that suggests about the overall health of the electronics market? And also maybe comment, was there any tailwind from inventory revaluation in the quarter?
Guillermo Novo: First, let me talk on the delivery systems. Actually nothing we've said is new. I think in the last two calls we already predicted that this -- the delivery systems, the equipment business was going to be slowing down versus prior year, a lot of it was because of some projects that we did last year. So our delta was probably more driven from that project differential. Now if you look at a lot of the projections and this has been how the actual demand has been tracking from a lot of the third party industry -- the projection was for a softening in CapEx that would start to pick up in the back end of 2016. And we are still tracking that. So it hasn't been a big surprise for us. Regarding the inventory reval, this is why I'm a little bit more cautious for the second quarter. Not that we are seeing a big change in dynamics versus what we've projected in the past, but in the near-term the headwinds of currency, oil price deflation and the impact it's having on our price so we should have some inventory reval. But also on the demand side, a lot of our customers -- unlike gases, we have inventory; our customers have inventory. And some of the demand softness that we are seeing is just people taking actions on their inventory levels.
Mike Harrison: All right. And then, you guys commented that refinery hydrogen volumes in EMEA were lower. Can you give some additional details on that? Were there some shutdowns or what's going on?
Guillermo Novo: Well, we did have a steam methane reformer that we shut down last year, but if I were going to say sequentially I think it's just a shift to slightly sweeter feedstock taking place there right now.
Mike Harrison: All right, thank you very much.
Guillermo Novo: Thanks Mike.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils Wallin: Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First off on Jazan, it looks the timing might have been pushed out a little bit, yet you are booking revenues now. So is there anything that is new or that you can update us on, on that project?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, we are not aware of anything being pushed out. The project is on schedule and Saudi Aramco is actually pushing us to complete the project on time. So we haven't had any delays on that. No, we are executing with great speed on that.
Nils Wallin: Understood. And just with respect to the LOX/LIN market in China, certainly there's been some talk about steel closures in some of the Chinese producers. Do you think that will affect overall LOX/LIN volumes or there will be no change there?
Seifi Ghasemi: I'll have Corning to comment on that.
Corning Painter: First of all, the results that we reported today reflect everything that has happened to-date. I think the question of what's going to happen in steel is interesting. Many of those steel mills have their own captive air separation plant. Many of them sell that onto the market and if those were to close, that would be an interesting impact and might take some capacity out.
Nils Wallin: Got it. Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have Duffy Fisher with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Hey, good morning, fellows.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi. Good morning, Duffy. How are you?
Duffy Fischer: Good. Thanks. Maybe first one for Scott, on the cost programs, which have been very successful so far, the first $300 million is kind of $75 million run rate per quarter. Did we see all of that impacting the first quarter? And then, when this year will we anniversary or when do you think we will anniversary that first $300 million? And then, on the second $300 million over four years, you would think about that as being $75 million per year. Is it back-end loaded, front-end loaded? How should we think about that rolling through?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all, on the $300 million, we did see the $75 million savings in the first quarter. And on the second thing, we have said $75 million a year, but we are beginning -- starting that beginning of 2016, so we expect to deliver about half of that in 2016. So in our forecast, we have about $35 million, $36 million of additional savings in 2016, but then in 2017 we should have the whole $75 million.
Duffy Fischer: Okay, understood. Great. Then just a follow-up on the China situation. You guys were reporting good volumes there or improving volumes. How long do you think that needs to continue before that market starts to get healthy? I know, Seifi, you've talked about it being massively oversupplied. I mean, is it a six-quarter issue? Is it a 12-quarter issue? How long before that market can start to get healthy?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it's obviously going to take a while because, as you know, the overcapacity, the installed capacity is about 55,000 and the demand is about 27,000 tons a day. But the shutdown of some of these older steel plants will help. Obviously, China is growing, so whether it will take another three years, another four years, or another five years is debatable. Anyway, that's my view. I'll have Corning to kind of comment on that too.
Corning Painter: I think we talk a lot focusing on what we control and we don't really fully control that marketplace and I really hesitate to guess how that's all going to be. But I think what matters for us is continuing to drive our retail sales, which sequentially are up again for us, working with end-use customers, continuing to load the capacity that we have in the ground and we are highly focused on that.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. Thank you, guys.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
Jim Sheehan: Good morning, Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Good morning.
Jim Sheehan: You guys gave some good commentary on the Asia market and then China. Was wondering if you could also give us an update on what merchant utilization rates look like in the other regions and what your outlook is in each one.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure. Corning will be happy to do that.
Corning Painter: Our utilization really runs in the 70s and a little bit lower, I guess, I would say, in South America right now. And I think we see ourselves continuing to operate in that range.
Jim Sheehan: And Europe?
Corning Painter: So I'm speaking for Europe as well. Europe would be in the 70s as well.
Jim Sheehan: Great. And in terms of your cash from operations outlook in 2016, how much growth are you expecting?
Seifi Ghasemi: When you say cash from operations, do you mean free cash flow? Well, we did about $200 million in the first quarter, so I'm hoping that that trend to continue, but I'm not suggesting we will have $800 million of free cash. But we might. I mean it depends on the project. It depends on how much money we spend on the new projects that are coming on stream, but we feel pretty good about significant free cash generation. Scott, you want to make any additional comments?
Scott Crocco: Sure, just to build on it. As I've said in the past, we're focused on generating as much cash as we can from our existing assets. That's the EBITDA. And then, as Seifi mentioned, going through our cash flow priorities, recognizing where to spend the right amount of money on the maintenance capital. And so we feel good about where we are. We are going to continue to focus on cash. Again, generating from the assets we have in the ground and then making sure that we are very disciplined in how we deploy that capital.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey: Hey, guys. Good morning. Seifi, in response to a previous question about the current global situation, I'm wondering if you can just help us understand, do you view the recent changes in global industrial demand, in energy and emerging markets, do you view that as cyclical or secular? And are there any implications on your growth strategy as you go forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Quite honestly, we haven't seen anything earth-shattering change in the last quarter since we talked to you last time. Obviously, as you know better than I do, it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen, but right now we don't have any reason to be pessimistic about growth opportunities for industrial gases. I have always said that I have a little bit of a different point of view from my colleagues. I see a lot of opportunities for us to engage in new projects. We have engaged in new projects and we have been able to win projects that were north of 10% return. So we continue to be optimistic about the opportunities for growth in different sectors around the world, especially U.S. Gulf Coast and obviously China in terms of bigger projects. We are focused on those. We have opportunities in the Middle East that we are working on. So I don't have any reason to be really pessimistic about the future of the industrial gases in general. Specifically, in terms of the liquid market in the different parts of the world, a little bit up, a little bit down, but nothing has really changed since we talked to you last time to make us more optimistic or less optimistic.
David Manthey: Okay. Thanks for taking the question.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Next we have a question from Mike Sison from KeyBanc.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.
Seifi Ghasemi: Hi, Mike.
Mike Sison: A couple of quick ones on Versum. What type of growth, earnings growth do you expect to see this year? And could you give us kind of how to think about that business over the next three to five years?
Seifi Ghasemi: Guillermo, will be happy to answer that. Whatever he says is not enough, we should do more than that, but go ahead.
Guillermo Novo: We are continuing to see good progress. I mean the core driver of our business, at the end of the day, is innovation and how we are playing in the different segments of the businesses that we are in, both in electronics and performance materials. So we are very bullish. We see the longer-term trends on mobility continue to grow, especially towards the back end of the year, environmental drivers, performance drivers that are driving our PMD business. So we said that we expect to grow at 1.5x to 2x GDP and we are still comfortable with that long-term outlook. Obviously, in the near term we have a little bit more fluctuation based on what's happening with the base business and that's more linked to GDP growth and global demand.
Mike Sison: Okay, great. Quick follow-up, in terms of the capacity expansions for advanced materials, do you have customers lined up for that? And how much growth does that support for you over the next couple years?
Guillermo Novo: If you look at our materials business, this is very different from the gases where it's more project oriented, you build it and then you sell it out. For us, we sell it out, we develop the products, we develop markets and then we built the capacity to support our long-term growth. So we don't look at it as we're going to start this plant and generate new business. We will reload our entire network and that will give us opportunities not only to support new volume growth, but optimize our cost structure, our supply chain and our productivity across the network.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Guillermo. We are well past the one hour usually allocated, so we will take one more question, please.
Operator: And the final question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Emily Wagner: Good morning. This is actually Emily Wagner on for Don Carson.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. Good morning.
Emily Wagner: Good morning. We just had a few questions on EMEA. Do you think you could break down the 470 basis points operating margin improvement from restructuring versus lower energy pass-through?
Scott Crocco: So, I think we are going to scramble to do that in the moment, but I would say the energy pass-through is a much smaller portion there than what we see in North America.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes. For the exact, exact number, obviously -- I would say -- I don't have the exact number to quote you, but I can confidently say that most of it is from restructuring. Simon can give you the exact number later, but I wouldn't be surprised if 90% of it is restructuring. As a matter of fact, it is 90% restructuring.
Emily Wagner: All right. Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Well, with that, thank you very much for being on our call. We very much appreciate your interest in the company and we look forward to talk to you next quarter and report even better results. Thank you again.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Sandra. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products fourth quarter 2015 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in our company. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products Executive Vice President in charge of Materials Technologies. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. A year ago, we promised our investors we would deliver earnings of $6.30 to $6.55 per share in fiscal year 2015. I am very proud to announce that despite weaker than forecasted economic activity and a headwind of more than $0.40 per share due to currency translation, the people of Air Products delivered earning per share of $6.57, which is higher than the top end of our forecast and a 14% improvement versus last year. We owe this excellent performance to the tireless and focused efforts of Air Products 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees. I want to thank the people of Air Products for coming together to prove that they have the determination and the capability to deliver outstanding results and move our company forward to be best industrial gas company in the world. Now, please turn to slide number 3. We always start our internal and external presentations with a discussion of our safety performance. We are making progress and, as you will note, our lost time injury rate improved by 17% and our recordable injury rate was 16% better than last year. We believe that excellence in safety performance requires focus, discipline, process orientation and execution. These are the same characteristics that drive excellence in business performance. The improvement in our safety results is encouraging but our ultimate goal remains zero accidents and zero incidents. Now, please turn to slide number 4. Our goal for the company has not changed. We are determined to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We have made great progress in the past year by improving our profit margins by 350 basis points. And we are all committed to work hard to achieve our stated goal. Now, please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy. Again, no change here. But I would like to reiterate our fundamental management philosophy in our approach to running Air Products. We believe strongly that cash generation is what drives long-term value. We believe that what counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not the size of our company or our growth rate. In addition, Air Products generates a significant amount of cash and the effective deployment of that cash is one of my most responsibilities as the CEO of the company. Finally, a decentralized organization releases entrepreneurial energy and keeps costs down. Now, please turn to slide number 6. A year ago, we announced the five-point strategic plan to transform Air Products. I would like to take a few minutes and let you know where we are in the implementation of this plan. The first point of the plan was to get Air Products focused on its core business, our core competency that is Industrial Gases. We have done this and recently announced that we will spin off our Materials Technologies business tax-free to our U.S. shareholders and set it up as a separate stand-alone public company. Materials Technologies is a great business and our people have significantly improved the performance of this business in the last year. We believe that Materials Technologies as specialty material business will be able to grow and expand and be more profitable as a separate company since its drivers for growth, capital requirement and optimal organizational structure is different from that of our core Industrial Gases business. So with the separation of Materials Technologies by September of 2016, we will be done with the first point of our plan. The second point of our plan was to recognize that our Industrial Gases business is a local business. We do have a global presence, but we should run the business in a decentralized manner, focused on specific geographies. Therefore, we embarked on the largest organizational restructuring that Air Products has ever undertaken in its 75-year history. We have created over 40 profit centers and a focused decentralized structure and eliminated the global organizational superstructure that that did not add much value. I am pleased to say that we are done. The new organization structure is in place. The key people are in the proper jobs and the organization is functioning and delivering results as you can see. The third point of our plan was to change the culture so that we can get everyone focused on safety, simplifying of our work processes, execution with speed and creating the organizational self-confidence that Air Products has the people and the portfolio to be the best in the industry. As you all know, changing the culture in a large company is not an easy task. We have and are making progress but we are not there. This is an area that we will continuously focus on until we have all of our 20,000 people committed to acting as if they are the CEO of the company and every day each one of them comes to work and looks for ways to improve our business, our business processes, and take actions that are necessary to move us forward with an eye to our safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence so that we can achieve our goal of being the most profitable industrial gas company in the world. The fourth point of our plan was the responsible use of cash and controlling our cost. In this area, we have made excellent progress. We have a very robust and agile process for reviewing every capital investment of more than $3 million at the corporate level and we have established a minimum hurdle rate of 10% internal rate of return for all new projects. In the area of cost savings, we have reduced our overhead costs by $300 million a year already and have a detailed plan to achieve an additional $300 million of operational cost savings in the next four years. Improving productivity and efficiency is a necessary and never-ending process that we are committed to continue as we move forward so then we can stay at the leading edge of our industry. The fifth point of our plan was to properly align our incentive reward program. We have totally restructured and changed this plan from what it was before. We now have over 40 profit and loss centers. Their performance is based on EBITDA results and people are rewarded for what they achieve in their specific business unit. This has created differentiation. And for example, in 2015, we have units that will get no incentive award to units that will get 200% of their targeted awards. And our long-term incentive plan is now very focused on total shareholder return. In summary, we have done what we said we would do. I'm thankful to all of the people of Air Products not only for implementing all of the major changes but, at the same time, staying focused and still delivering an excellent performance for the year while winning new projects. Now, please turn to slide number 7, our annual results. Scott will take you through the details later, but I want to point out that in 2015, we improved our margins by 360 basis points and we delivered positive free cash flow despite a weak worldwide economy and a $0.40 negative impact from currency exchange translation. And if you turn to slide number 8 now, which is my favorite slide, you will see our progress in the last seven quarters where we have improved our margins by more than 700 basis points. We are determined to continue to improve our margins until we become the best in the industry. In slide number 9, we show you our distributed cash flow of more than $10 a share. We believe this measure, more than earnings per share, is the true measure of the wealth we are creating for our shareholders. Up to now, I've been focused on mentioning our efforts on improving our cost structure and delivering the financial targets. But at the same time, we have been very focused on winning projects to ensure future growth. Please turn to slide number 10. As I mentioned earlier, we announced our intention to spin off Materials Technologies. Also in 2015, we were successful in bringing onstream some of our key large projects in China, such as PCEC, ZY [Zhengyuan] and YK [Yankuang] with over 20,000 per day of additional oxygen capacity onstream. Our customers are running their facilities. They are using the oxygen we produce. And most importantly, we are getting paid. We were successful and honored to have Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, award us the right to build the world's largest industrial gas complex with an investment of more than $2 billion. Once built, this facility will supply almost 75,000 tons per day of oxygen and nitrogen to Aramco based on a long-term 20-year supply contract. We have also won a significant contract to build a world scale facility for a major semiconductor company in South Korea and an oxygen supply contract for Big River Steel in the United States. And as we announced on Monday, we are building a world-class hydrogen plant with an investment of around $400 million to supply hydrogen and CO to our pipeline system in Texas. It's also important to note that we are now celebrating 75th anniversary of being in the business of serving our customers and we look forward to serving them the distinction for the next 75 years. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details of the year and discuss our very strong quarterly results. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks. And then we will be delighted to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you very much, Seifi. I would like to make a few additional comments on our fiscal 2015 results. Please turn to slide 11. For the year, underlying sales growth increased by 3% with 2% coming from higher volumes driven by Gases-Asia new plant onstreams and Materials Technologies. And 1% coming from higher pricing in Gases-Americas and Materials Technologies. Operating margin was up 310 basis points to 19% and EBITDA margin was up 360 basis points to 30.1%. This reflects balanced volume, pricing and cost performance. Only 40 basis points of the operating margin increase came from lower energy pass-through. Now, please turn to slide 12 for some full-year EPS comments. Year-on-year EPS growth of 14% was fairly well distributed across higher volumes, improved pricing and lower costs. Combined, these added about $1.20 per share to our FY 2015 results versus prior year. Key drivers included volume growth in Gases-Asia, Materials Technologies and LNG, price mix improvement in Gases-Americas and Materials Technologies, and better cost performance across all of our segments as our cost actions more than offset incentive comp and inflation headwinds. This was more than enough to offset unfavorable currency and foreign exchange headwinds of about $0.40. Interest expense was $0.08 lower primarily due to higher capitalized interest. And this more than offset the $0.06 impact of higher shares outstanding. Now, please turn to slide 13 for a more detailed review of our Q4 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 9% versus last year on unfavorable currency of 7% and a lower energy pass-through impact of 3%. Volumes were flat as Gases-Asia growth continued, and our LNG business posted another solid quarter while Materials Technologies and Gases-Americas volumes were down. Corning and Guillermo will comment more on this later. Pricing was 1% higher for the fourth consecutive quarter and again driven by price increases in Gases-Americas and Gases-Europe, and both price increases and mix in Materials Technologies. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved by 2% and operating income improved by 9% despite the lower sales. EBITDA margin improved 350 basis points to 32.1% while our operating margin improved 340 basis points to 21%. We saw margin improvements across all of our segments. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 40 basis points to the operating margin improvement. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 300 basis points resulted primarily from higher prices and lower costs. Better cost performance including lower incentive comp also contributed to our sequential margin improvement. We continue to improve our performance and this quarter is another new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Versus prior year, net income increased 11% and earnings per share grew 10% and we continued to improve our return on capital employed, which increased 140 basis points to 12.4% this quarter. Now, please turn to slide 14. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow decreased this quarter due to the timing of cash tax payments. However, free cash flow was positive $40 million which is the strongest quarter this year. We remain focused on spending the right amount at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. From a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes. Turning to slide 15, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q4 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that totaled $0.24 per share or $59 million pre-tax. This includes $49 million for position eliminations and pension settlements, and $20 million for asset actions, primarily related to a plant shutdown. Included in the other income and expense P&L line is a $34 million gain on land sales. This is an example of our very strong focus on optimizing all of our assets including property that was not providing value for Air Products. We also saw Materials Technologies separation costs of $7.5 million for legal and advisory fees. And finally, we recorded a loss on early debt retirement of $17 million as we redeemed some high-interest rate bonds in Chile. We expect to see restructuring and pension settlement costs continue through next year. We have essentially completed the actions associated with our first $300 million of overhead reductions. Further actions will be part of the second $300 million of operational improvements. Further details on all non-GAAP items can be found in an appendix slide and in the footnotes to our earnings release. Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $1.82 increased $0.16 per share or 10% versus last year despite the significant currency headwinds. Volumes increased EPS by $0.02 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.12. Net cost performance was $0.16 favorable as higher incentive compensation partially offset the $0.23 benefit from our cost reduction actions. These cost reduction benefits consist of lower personnel costs as well as actions enabled by our new more disciplined organization, including reducing contractors, consultants, travel and other discretionary spending. Unfavorable currency in FX was $0.16 as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, for gases, our currency exposure is primarily translation as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Interest expense was $0.02 lower, due to higher capitalized interest and the remaining items are small and net to zero. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, we completed the buy-up of the remaining shares of the Indura business in Chile during the fourth quarter. Because we previously owned a majority if Indura and were already consolidating results, there was no impact to our reported sales, EBITDA or operating income. This purchase is reflected in the financing activity section of our cash flow statement and the redeemable non-controlling interest that was shown on our balance sheet is now eliminated. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thanks, Scott. Please turn to slide 16. First, I would like to thank the entire Industrial Gases team for delivering a very strong FY 2015. Implementing the five-point plan was our key focus this year. We decentralized the organization to create greater local authority and accountability and more of an entrepreneurial spirit. This allowed us to significantly reduce our cost structure. Our new incentive system, which energizes and rewards local teams for their EBITDA performance, focuses us on cash flow and reinforces the cultural changes we are driving. We have more to do in terms of safety, speed, simplicity and self-confidence, but we are excited to be on our way. The hard work of our people combined with our streamlined and faster organization produced tremendous results in every region. For the full fiscal 2015, Americas' EBITDA margin was up 450 basis points despite modest economic growth. EMEA's EBITDA margin was up 180 basis points despite weak economic growth. And Asia's EBITDA margin was 210 basis points despite the merchant overcapacity and slowing economy in China. Our people delivered these results by staying focused on what we control, namely, working safely and driving costs out with the new and simpler organization, and we stay focused on customers. As Seifi has mentioned, we are very excited to be awarded a number of key projects this year that will support profitable growth into the future. We had a pair of announcements in the last two weeks on our U.S. Gulf Coast pipeline system. First is a new agreement to supply 44 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen from our pipeline system to Pallas for ammonia production in Pasadena, Texas. Pallas will enjoy the speed, simplicity and reliability that comes from the world's largest hydrogen pipeline network. Second is a new world-class steam methane reformer we will build in Baytown, Texas. This plant will provide 125 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen to support the growth on our U.S. Gulf Coast system, and it will provide additional reliable supply of carbon monoxide to our petrochemical customers. Great examples of Air Products wining in the marketplace while creating value for shareholders. The team is excited about the opportunity to further improve the business. Having completed our reorganization, we are very focused on operational productivity to drive additional P&L improvement regardless of the economic environment. With that, please turn to slide 17 for a review of our Gases-Americas, which includes Latin America, fourth quarter results. Despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes, our continued focus on cost expanded our margins. Sales of $902 million were down 13% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 9% and currency reduced sales by 4%. Underlying sales were flat as higher pricing offset lower volumes. We continue to see lower demand in Latin America helium and the oilfield services market. We also saw a further weakening of steel demand that impacts our oxygen sales and argon co-production. And as I mentioned last quarter, wholesale pipeline oxygen sales are down, and we will replace that volume with retail business. HyCO volumes were essentially flat as refiners continue to run hard. Pricing was up 2% with continued strength in helium, and we worked hard to cover inflationary and power cost increases in Latin America Operating income of $209 million was down 5% and EBITDA of $330 million was down 3% as profit headwinds from currency, higher incentive compensation and lower energy pass-through more than offset the benefits of our restructuring actions and lower maintenance costs. Record operating margin was up 190 basis points with about three-quarters of that coming from lower energy pass-through. Record EBITDA margin was up about 370 basis points. As I said, the team is excited about driving further business improvement in 2016 despite an uncertain economic environment and more scheduled maintenance outages. Now, please turn to slide 18. For the Europe, Middle East and Africa regional business, we saw the benefit of our cost restructuring actions as both EBITDA and operating margin set new records, both up about 200 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $460 million were reduced 14% due to currency, primarily the euro and the British pound. Underlying sales were up 2% with volumes up 1% and pricing up 1%. Our liquid bulk volumes were positive while we continue to see volume weakness in the packaged gases business, in part due to weakness in the offshore oil and gas market. And as I said last quarter, we continue to see some negative volume impacts on our Rotterdam hydrogen pipeline, in part due to transportation fuel imports from the U.S. negatively impacting European refinery operations and in part due to the closure of a hydrogen plant there. We are pleased to see another quarter of positive pricing. Operating margin was up 190 basis points while operating income was down 2% as the positive contribution from pricing and our cost reduction actions was more than offset by the currency impact and higher incentive compensation. EBITDA margin was up 220 basis points while EBITDA was down 5%. On a constant currency basis, operating income was up 11%. We will continue to prove the business in 2016, but expect seasonally weak volumes and planned maintenance outages to impact Q1. Please turn to slide 19. Gases-Asia delivered another strong quarter with new plants driving both volume and profit growth. Versus last year, sales were up 7% to $428 million with volumes up 15% primarily from the new plants, partially offset by a negative 7% impact from currency primarily in Korea, Taiwan and China. Overall merchant volumes were up mid-single digits across Asia. Our China retail LOX/LIN business was up low-mid-single digits, while overall China LOX/LIN was down as we focused on increasing our retail business while reducing wholesale volume. We still see end market demand growth in China but excess capacity continues to impact merchant pricing. As I mentioned last quarter, the majority of our plants in China are protected by secure take-or-pay terms. And with the large on-site plants coming onstream, this proportion of our business is only growing. The first phases of the largest oxygen on-site complex Air Products has ever built started up in Yulin. As our customer brings their gasifiers fully online, we will bring on additional phases through the first half of FY 2016. As I also mentioned last quarter, occasionally we will see swings in the energy pass-through around customer startups. This has no impact on profit, but it can impact sales and margins. Once again, most importantly, customers are executing their projects, operating their gasifiers, taking oxygen and we are getting paid. Our reported profitability was very strong, with operating income up 40% and operating margin up 620 basis points, while EBITDA was up 17% and EBITDA margin was up 330 basis points. Our underlying business remains strong and we are seeing the benefits of the new projects coming onstream and our cost reduction actions. In addition, this quarter's comparison benefited from some one-time cost items last year and a positive catch-up payments from on-site customers this quarter. As we look to 2016, the Asia team is focused on driving business improvement and continuing to start up the large projects in our backlog. We would expect Q1 FY 2016 to be closer to Q1 FY 2015 due to some of the one-time benefits I mentioned. I'll close with a few words about the Global gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Unit sale of equipment business as well as costs associated with the Industrial Gas business which are not regional specific. Our overall sales were flat with last year, although the business mix was different, with lower small equipment sales and higher ASU sales. This significant profit improvement versus last year was driven by our cost reduction actions and positive project performance and closeouts. Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology: Thank you, Corning. On September 16, Air Products announced the intention to separate our Materials Technologies business through a tax-free spinoff to our U.S. shareholders. This strategic decision will allow both Materials Technologies and Air Products Industrial Gases to leverage our respective strengths and will enable better business performance for both companies over the long term. The Materials Technologies team is very excited about the tremendous opportunity to remain focused on executing our strategy while driving safety, business improvement and taking care of our customers. At the same time, a number of us are working on the key steps required to enable the spin-off. We're making good progress and continue to expect to complete the transaction before September 2016. Prior to the transaction, I look forward to the opportunity to spend time with you to share more details on our plans for the future success of this business. Please turn to slide 20. In Q4, segment sales of $490 million were down 13% versus prior year, including a negative 4% impact from currency. Underlying sales were down 9% on 11% lower volumes and 2% higher prices. As I indicated on the last call, we have begun seeing some of the softening in the macro demand across our portfolio, especially in Asia and particularly in Delivery Systems. Let me share with you the key drivers for Q4 results. For the Electronics segment, the 9% underlying sales reduction is all due to the Delivery Systems business. As we discussed in the past, this business consists of both equipment sales and turnkey installation work. We completed several major turnkey projects last year which did not repeat. These projects had a big impact on 2014 Q4 and 2015 Q1. We also saw the anticipated impact of the CapEx spending softening in the semiconductor industry this quarter. Excluding Delivery Systems, the underlying sales of Electronics was up 15% relative to prior year. Advanced Materials continues to show strength in innovation-driven growth as well as growth from our materials targeting memory and new technology nodes. Processed Materials held up well on continued strong memory market demand, but we are now running at capacity for several of our key products. We continue to focus on driving productivity, yield improvement, as well as expanding capacity at some of our key plants. Performance Materials sales were down 8% on a constant currency basis on lower volumes across all three businesses. Epoxy volumes were impacted by weaker oil and gas, pipe and tank, and marine coatings demand. Additives volumes were impacted by oil and gas and mining weakness. And polyurethane additives volumes were down on weaker auto and appliance demand. Additive sales were also impacted by the deflationary pricing environment driven by lower oil prices and falling raw material prices. Currency continues to be a significant headwind for our business. As you know, for the Industrial Gases business, currency is almost completely a translational item. But for Materials Technologies business, given the global nature of our supply network, we also have transaction impact from currency, especially in Performance Materials where North America supplies a significant portion of our demand in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Sequentially, sales were impacted by currency, weaker delivery systems and lower Performance Materials demand. Despite the volume weakness, EBITDA of $140 million resulted in a margin increase of 130 basis points and operating income of $116 million resulted in a margin increase of 160 basis points. Profits would have been roughly flat versus last year on a constant currency basis. Currency, lower Performance Materials volumes, softer Delivery Systems demand, inventory revaluation from deflationary pricing and higher incentive compensation costs were partially offset by strong margin management, improvement in our business mix, productivity and our cost-reduction actions. For Materials Technologies excluding Delivery Systems, our EBITDA would have been up low-to-mid single digits despite the currency headwinds. Please turn to slide 21 for a review of our full-year results. During fiscal year 2015, the Materials Technologies team delivered a tremendous result, a second year of significant improvement in the quality of our business. Despite modest end market growth, we increased both operating margins and EBITDA margins by over 400 basis points. Innovation, margin management actions and cost focus more than offset headwinds from weak macroeconomic demand, currency and higher incentive compensation. As I shared with you last quarter, we have been able to capture significant volume growth and several of our businesses are now running their plants at very high utilization rates. We have initiated several investments to expand capacity in both the U.S. and in Asia. These investments include our new Performance Materials production facility in Texas, capacity expansions in Processed Materials and Advanced Materials and productivity improvement investments. Our rapid growth and tight capacity will limit our volume growth capabilities in the early part of 2016 but will support our longer term growth expectations starting the second half of the year. Even with these investments, the Materials Technologies business still generates a very high level of free cash flow. Our maintenance CapEx is only about 1.5% of sales and our growth capital average is 2% to 3% of sales on a normalized basis. Innovation continues to be at the core of our organic growth and for our future products and solutions for our customers. We are confident in the returns we're getting from our technology investments and are committed to maintaining the technology leadership in the market segments we're focused on. Overall, while we're disappointed by the market demand for Performance Materials, we are pleased with our innovation initiatives and the hard work around productivity, margin management and cost actions by the team. Regardless of the weaker macroeconomic conditions, currency and raw material dynamics, we drove margin improvements in Q4 and for the full year. For Electronics, while there are signs of softening demand, we do not foresee a significant downturn in the electronics industry. For Performance Materials, we expect to continue to see challenges from macro demand and currency. Regardless of the macroeconomic headwinds, we expect to improve our profitability and deliver higher profits in 2016 than we did in 2015. However, we do expect to see our typical seasonal profit drop from Q4 to Q1, so more of the improvement will come in the second half of the fiscal year. We are executing and remain focused on our key priorities: safety, top line growth and margin enhancement. Equally important, we're committed to meeting or exceeding our timeline for the spin-off of Materials Technologies as a stand-alone company. This is the second year of strong performance improvement for Materials Technologies. I'm certain that I can speak for the entire team that we are committed to adding value to our customers, to the success of our business and to creating an exciting and profitable future for all stakeholders. Again, I look forward to spending time with you to discuss our business in more details. I provided you details on how our business is performing this year, this quarter and into next year. But let me summarize and re-emphasize that we expect to deliver higher profits from Materials Technologies in fiscal year 2016 than we did in fiscal year 2015. The improvements we've made over the last two years have fundamentally changed and strengthened the Materials Technologies business and positioned us well to continue to deliver profitable growth. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for quick comments on the Corporate segment.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, Guillermo. Our Corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses as well as corporate costs which are not business-specific. Sales were up this quarter versus last year as we continue to see higher LNG sales more than offsetting lower helium container sales. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact our FY 2016 results. The improved profitability this quarter was primarily driven by the higher LNG activity and the benefit of reduced corporate costs. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you again, Simon. Now, please turn to slide number 22 for a discussion of our outlook. The Air Products team continues to stay focused on our goal of becoming the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. We have made great progress in fiscal year 2015 and delivered a 14% improvement in our operating profit. And we expect to continue our journey during fiscal year 2016. Our guidance for fiscal year 2016 is to actually deliver earnings per share of $7.25 to $7.50 per share. At mid point, this will be an increase of $0.81 or 12% over our very strong fiscal year 2015 performance. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 is for earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.75. At mid point, this will be an increase of $0.15 or 10% over the fiscal first quarter of last year. The full year and quarterly guidance obviously includes Materials Technologies. We expect our CapEx expense to be about $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in 2016 which is down slightly from this year. As you have seen from our recent project announcements, we see great opportunities to invest Air Products substantial cash flow into good high-return projects in our core Industrial Gases business. Despite an uncertain economic environment, the Air Products team will stay focused, as they did this year, to take actions that we control to actually deliver the results that we promise despite economic conditions or currency exchange rates. I would like to add that I have now been Chairman and CEO of Air Products for the past 16 months. I am now convinced more than ever that Air Products has a great future ahead of it. We do have an outstanding team of talented, dedicated and motivated people who are driving change, and we are blessed with having the great portfolio of businesses around the world with more than 700,000 outstanding customers to serve. I'm proud of our people and considered it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team. Now, we are delighted to answer your questions.
Operator: And we'll go first to Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Mr. Fischer, your line is open. Please go ahead.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, fellows.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Duffy. How are you?
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good. Thanks. Maybe start on Seifi's favorite slide, slide 8. Very impressive performance in the margin there. Can you break out into buckets where the big chunks of that have come from? How much has been from the cost savings? How much has been from new plants coming online? And then maybe talk about how that would have been different than what you would have thought day one that you took the job where that was going to come from?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, approximately half of that 700 basis points is cost savings and the other half is related to price increases, volumes and the new plants coming onstream. And in terms of my expectations the day that I started, I thought that it would take us three years to get that 300 basis points improvement and it has been accomplished in one year and I'm very proud of that.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then from your slide 9 where you walked through the cash flow there, maintenance capital last year was $311 million, maintenance capital this year $250 million. When you think about maintenance capital, I would have thought there isn't that much variation from year to year. How should we think about a normalized maintenance cap level for you guys?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We have always said that order of magnitude around $300 million.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure. Thank you.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, Duffy.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. You said that your CapEx next year would be, I don't know, $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion. Is that also your non-GAAP CapEx or is your non-GAAP CapEx different?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Scott, you want to...
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Hi, Jeff. That is both our GAAP and non-GAAP CapEx. We haven't been doing – the adjustment that you're referring to is the capital leases in the 2001-2008. We haven't been doing those lately, so that's both GAAP and non-GAAP.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And you were kind enough to give an indication of what you thought you would earn next year. Your GAAP earnings have been lower than your adjusted earnings. Do you have an idea of what your GAAP range would be for next year?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I don't expect too many so called one-off items. The biggest one-off items we have had this year has been the restructuring, which has been about $212 million, $213 million. And next year, there will be some restructuring charge, but I don't expect the magnitude to be as big, Jeff.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Hi, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Couple of questions on China. First, three major projects you're starting up with 20,000 tons per day of oxygen. What is the EPS impact of these projects? And then secondly, you mentioned that you have this new strategy of increasing your retail sales in China and reducing your wholesale volumes in China. Can you just talk a little bit more about that strategy?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. I think Corning would be delighted to answer the questions.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: So I'm not sure that we've given out specific guidance on specific projects, but I think, in general, we would expect them to come in with the profitability that you would expect from the guidelines we put out. I think the key point is this is a question of exactly what's the timing and when are they on and fully onstream but, again, we see all of our customers progressing their plants, building them to construction. They don't operate without oxygen, so they need us and they pay us for it. I don't expect big surprises there. In terms of retail versus wholesale, so I think it's common when people first bring on a new liquefier that in terms of getting loading, a lot of that volume may go into a wholesale sort of environment. We don't have new liquid to bring on at this point. All of our liquid is currently on. And so we're naturally in the process of preferentially signing and selling to retail customers and, to a large extent, that's about application sales, helping customers to be more efficient and more productive in their own operations and that's something you can do in any economic environment, right, because you're helping them to be more competitive. And when you think an emerging market, right, they're not typically as, let's say, industrial gas intensive or developed as a more mature economy and that's another reason we're able to push that in China today even in the current economic environment.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. And my second question is on your free cash flow. Can you talk about sort of if you have any growth, long term growth for free cash flow? And Scott, maybe a rationale for buying out Indura now? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Go ahead.
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. So in terms of free cash flow, as we've talked in the past, we're going to make sure that we maintain our A rating. We're going to drive EBITDA up, generating as much cash out of the existing assets we have and then we're going to evaluate the growth opportunities with organic growth opportunities being the ones that we're going to be able to create the most value for our shareholder. That's what we done under Seifi over the last 16 months and that's what we're going to continue going forward. In terms of Indura, that was exercised by our minority partner per the contract, and so that was a put that he put to us. And now that we own that, we have the opportunities to take control and drive improvements across the business that we weren't able to do previously. By the way, you'll see that also in a variety of forms, including the fact that we paid down some high cost debt, about $147 million bond that was out there at roughly 10%. And so, we're going to see some improvement in interest expense as part of what we did here this quarter. So, another example of the things that we're doing in Indura to drive improvement.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, P.J.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, David.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Hi, David.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Seifi, very impressive margins in Gases-Americas, EBITDA of 34.9% in 2015. How much higher can it go in 2016 do you think?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, obviously, some of that is dependent, David, on what the economy will do and what kind of a leverage we get. But at the same time, we have said that we are going to have another $75 million of cost savings in 2016. A lot of that is in the Americas, so I expect those margins to continue to improve.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And just on Tees Valley, Seifi, do you have an update? And what should we think about the impact from a earnings standpoint from Tees Valley to be in 2016?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: There will be no income from Tees Valley in 2016. In our forecast that we have given you, there is no consideration for any contribution from Tees Valley.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Will it be a loss-making entity in 2016?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I'm sorry?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Will it lose money in 2016?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. I don't expect it to lose money.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Bob.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Seifi, I want to follow up on Tees. I recognize your desire to be pretty cautious and conservative on that. But you guys are plunking down $1 billion. And at the time the contracts were written, I thought they were fixed price. Has something changed about the revenue base that you'd previously contracted for that would put it into a breakeven position instead of a moneymaker?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, the Tees Valley, Bob, we are in the process of starting up that plant. So we don't expect that plant to really be in commercial operation in 2016. So that's why we have assumed that it would not be contributing to the bottom line.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sorry. Just to be clear, so the contract terms you had on the waste fee, power fee, renewables, none of that's changed? It's just the ability to get it into commercialization and it's...
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...I guess it's at least three years behind. Is that an indictment of the technology or is there some other issue at work?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. It's just related to the technology. We have always said that there is a chance that the technology will not work, Bob, so we are still working to figure out whether it does work or not.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: There's a good chance that it doesn't work, so we have to be aware of that and I have been mentioning that for the past year.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. And then, let me ask you more broadly, Seifi, I mean, from your prior tenure in the gases industry, it seems like the world has gotten much tougher for industrial gas companies. I know your volumes in the last year are up about 2%. I think your friends at Praxair, they're down 1% or 2% so far this year. I think the packaged guys in the U.S. Airgas are down a little bit. But the globe hasn't been in a recession. So is there something fundamentally broken about the old multipliers between gases demand and economic growth?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Bob, I don't really see that. I think that what we are facing with right now in terms of the growth in volume is just that the LOX/LIN volumes are down. But when you look at our on-site facilities, the volumes are not that far down. We are making significant progress in China and I think in the long term there is a lot of opportunities for industrial gases. And I think all of the industrial gas companies in time will enjoy about 1.5 times GDP growth rates. I don't see any fundamental change in that.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks for the help.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much, Bob.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Take care, Bob.
Operator: And we'll go next to Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group: Yes. Thank you. Seifi, just wondering, in next year's guidance, how much greater is the contribution from new projects? And as you look at the backlog, I notice you indicated your new Baytown facility was sold out the day you announced it. So should we assume more announcements on U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen, and could that be offset by sort of the end of the Chinese coal gasification opportunity?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, first of all, I don't expect that the Chinese coal gasification would – that it is the end. I think there's still a lot of opportunity there, and we will appropriately participate on that. We have gotten off of the habit of giving you a specific forecast about new projects because that is too much competitive information to give away. So I apologize for not giving you that. But we are very optimistic. You have seen the projects that we have announced. And we are saying that next year, our forecast right now is that we will increase our profits by 15% as compared to other people. So I think that's a good indication that we will see additional volumes.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And then as a follow-up on price, I notice your October 1st price increase initiative. It seems pretty aggressive for North America, given where operating rates are, I think 20% on liquid argon, 15% LIN/LOX. And I know these take time to roll through, but are conditions in the North American merchant market improving to the point where you think you can get a lot of this price?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, obviously, we hope that that would be the case. And then what happens in the real world, it remains to be seen but it certainly is our intent to implement the price increases.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to John Roberts of UBS.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. 2016 will be the fourth year of lower capital spending. Based on these new wins and so forth you've been having recently, do you think this is the bottom in 2016?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: I wouldn't want – well, you have to consider that Air Products spent a significant amount of money on the waste to energy project. Obviously, we are not going to invest in waste to energy projects in the future. So if you take that out, then I think we will continue to see a growth in the investment in the gases business.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. So, the total number might decline but gases would be turning around?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, sir.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: And then, in the Materials segment, the dispensing equipment part of the business has always had greater cyclicality. I don't believe that you manufacture the equipment. So, is there a different business model you might take in that business that would make it more variabilized so that you reduce the cyclicality on the total business?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That's a very good question. I'm going to have Guillermo address that question.
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President-Materials Technology: Thank you for the question. If you look at our Delivery Systems business, it's roughly around 10% of the portfolio. As I indicated, there's really two parts to it: the equipment side and the turnkey projects. The equipment side, we actually do manufacture all the delivery equipment both for the specialty gases, the specialty materials and we also have a business for slurry delivery in part of the portfolio. So those we do manufacture and we do sell. There is some volatility in that part of it, but it's pretty steady. Where we get the majority of the volatility is in the turnkey projects, and those are really project-driven activities. And those are just going to be the nature of when the projects come. But the turnkey projects is not the majority of the business.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Jim. How are you?
Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Say, on your 2016 outlook, what are you incorporating there as your assumption for FX headwinds, and how much of the growth is going to be attributable to organic growth, please?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: In the forecast that we have given you, we have assumed that we will have a hit of about $0.10 for exchange rate translation. That's the assumption that is in there. In terms of organic growth versus – we have assumed not much of a organic growth because we don't believe that the economic conditions around the world will be that robust next year. So, most of our growth is going to – the growth in EPS is going to come from cost reduction and from our on-site businesses.
Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jim.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: And we'll go next to David Manthey of Robert W. Baird.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Seifi, it looks like you achieved the first $300 million of cost improvement about three months ahead of your recent plan, so you're on to the next $300 million. Can you outline some of the examples of operational improvement that you hope to achieve over this four-year period?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. I think I'd like to have Corning kind of address this because he is in charge of the delivering the other $300 million. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thank you, Seifi. So, the reality is in this business, the nature of our business, this is the 10,000 little things that we talk about. And even if I was going to say improving spec power, well, it's spec power over many different plants, all of whom have their own operating situation. So I think the thing I'd really like to stress here is what enables you to drive 10,000 things better than you used to? And it heavily goes to the organizational changes that we've made, right? So, we've gone to a much more decentralized and empowered field organization where those production assets are. Number two, we have one owner for these assets. It used to be there might be someone who had the tonnage business or electronics business and then the merchant business, different debates about how to optimize the use of that. That's over. That's done. That's behind us. And then, we've got the incentive plan, right, which motivates every one of these local teams to think about their EBITDA, how do they drive productivity, every one of them each day. And I think those three drivers are a very powerful move that's moving us through to optimize those 10,000 and to hit these productivity targets.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And your confidence level there, I would imagine you have folks that have run these types of facilities for you that have also run them at other companies and roughly 300 basis points of the overall you think is a reasonable estimate for how inefficient your operations are relative to what something would be running it if it's optimal today?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: So, I think I'd rather not get into is it optimal, unoptimal today, this and that. I think a couple of things here. Number one, there is something going on in this company and we are absolutely, positively committed to being the safest and most profitable company while giving our customers excellent service. That's what this is about. And if other companies move up, then we just need to do more. We are committed to that. We're motivated for that. We've kind of unleashed the productivity with this new organization. And do we see opportunities to do things better in line with what we're doing? Yes. Do we have plans in place for this? Yes, we do.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just a quick one for you, Scott. In Asia, you mentioned there were these catch-up payments. I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what they were, whether there are any more to come going forward and whether they were 100% margin in the quarter? That'd be helpful.
Michael Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. Thank you. So these are, of course, specific to an individual or a set of customers, so it's very difficult to go into the specifics about them. I think the key point is associated typically with a start-up and which products they want and where are we in terms of the start-up process at different points in time. And perhaps the other really key point is we've collected everything. So it's all in the P&L and it's all been in. And so I don't see that repeating in a significant way going forward.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: All right Vince. Okay. Why don't we take one more question?
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Mike Harrison of Seaport Global.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. We knew you were on the line, so go ahead, Mike.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Thanks very much. Was curious if you could delineate what the split is between your retail and wholesale merchant volumes in China now and how has that changed over time?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Well, I think Corning can answer that question easily. Go ahead, Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. Because of the competitive nature, I think we would rather not go into the specifics of this other than to say that, let's say, in LOX/LIN, we are, at this point, certainly predominantly retail direct to customers, and we see a slow but steady improvement. With a large basis like that, it doesn't change overnight. But I'd rather not get into exact specifics just for competitive reasons.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: Okay. And then, looking at the Industrial Gases- Global segment, there was much better profitability this quarter. You called out some lower costs, but are we starting to see the Jazan ASU sales trickle in there and can you give any guidance for that segment for next year?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: There isn't much of Jazan in the numbers that we have for 2015. And for 2016, I think Jazan is a project that is a 20-year project and the profits will come after the plant starts up four years from now. For 2016, we are going to be very cautious in recognizing any profit in terms of the sales from the plant because these plants need to come onstream. You had a lot of obligations in terms of performance guarantees and all of that. So one has to be cautious and there is a lot of accounting rules that we have to follow on that. So there isn't a lot of projections for a lot of profit for that in 2016.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC: All right. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And so with that, I'd like to thank everybody. Thank you for taking the time again to be on our call. We appreciate that and we look forward to discussing our results with you in the next quarter.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products & Chemicals Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded at the request of Air Products. Please note that this presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Air Products' third quarter 2015 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in our company. First, let me introduce the members of our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products' Executive Vice President in charge of Material Technologies. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. I am very pleased to report that Air Products team delivered great results in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Therefore, before I go any further, I want to thank all of the talented, dedicated and committed employees of Air Products for doing such a great job. What we are presenting you today is the result of our 20,000 employees coming to work every day, committed to serving our customers and improving every aspect of our performance. Our people are the force behind our progress. I certainly consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team. Now, please turn to slide number 3. We always start our internal and external presentations with a discussion of our safety performance. Year-to-date, we improved our lost time injury rate by 21% and recordable injury rate by 17%. As we have said before, excellence in safety requires focus, discipline, process orientation and execution. These same characteristics are required for excellence in business performance, too. The improvement in our safety results, which is our number one priority, is encouraging, but our ultimate goal is zero accidents and zero incidents. Now, please turn to slide number 4. I would like to continue to remind everybody that our goal has always been, and will continue to be, to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. This is not an aspirational goal. It is not a goal that we just dream about. It is real and it is the target of the day-to-day activities of all of our 20,000 people who are determined to get us there. Last year, we were number three. Now, we are number two, and we are focused to becoming number one. Now, please turn to slide number 5, our overall management philosophy. Some of you have seen this slide before, but it is important to emphasize that we believe cash is king, and the true measures of our performance is the price of our stock in the long-term. We are very focused on proper allocation of capital. Air Products generates a significant amount of cash. We, the management of the company, fully understand that the proper and sensible allocation of that cash is a clear element of value creation for our shareholders. And as you have seen from our actions in the last year, we have moved toward a decent role organization, which has had the benefit of creating accountability and reducing our costs. Now, please turn to slide number 6, our five-point strategic plan that we announced in September of 2014. We are diligently and consistently executing this plan. And you can certainly see the impact on our results, which clearly show the improvement in profit margins. When we announced our strategy, we said that the proper execution of this plan will lead to an improvement in our margins of 600 basis points or about $600 million. Half of that or about $300 million was to come from reducing our overhead costs enabled by the significant reorganization of the company. We are making great progress and expect to deliver about $150 million of these benefits into our P&L this year. We expect to be at the full annual rate of $300 million of saving by quarter two of fiscal year 2016. So, you will see almost the full $300 million impact in our 2016 results. The other half or another $300 million will be savings in distribution, operations, electrical usage and other field operational costs. Currently, we expect to get all of these savings in the next four years. Now, please turn to slide number 7. Scott will take you through the details, but I want to highlight a few key points. Our EBITDA profit margin is up 430 basis points versus last year. We are now generating free cash flow, and our earning per share is up 13% versus last year despite the weak economy across the globe and $0.11 negative impact from currency translation. In addition, our return on capital employed now stands at 10.9%, which is an improvement of 130 basis points versus last year. As Scott will explain, we improved our margins in all of our businesses and specifically showed significant improvement in our core Industrial Gases business. I am encouraged by the results and the progress we have made in the last years. Now, please turn to slide number 8, where you will see our steady progress in improving our EBITDA margin. We do appreciate that we have more work to do to become the most profitable industrial gas company in the world. But as you can see, we are on our way. Air Products is moving forward with the full force and support of all of our 20,000 people. I am very proud of the team and very optimistic about our future. Before I turn it over to Scott, I would like to comment on the appointment of Mr. Casey Cogut, who will be joining the board of Air Products. Mr. Cogut is one of the most prominent and well-known corporate lawyers in America. He has extensive experience, has been involved in some of the largest mergers and acquisition transactions in the last 30 years, and has been a sought-after adviser to the board of many companies. I am very pleased to welcome him to the Air Products board. He brings with him, a wealth of knowledge and experience that we currently do not have on our board. We have issued a separate press release about his appointment and his background. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details. Then, I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo, and Simon to make some closing remarks, and then we will be pleased to answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now, please turn to slide 9 for a more detailed review of our Q3 results. Sales of $2.5 billion decreased 6% as strong underlying growth of 4% was more than offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 6% and a lower energy pass-through impact of 4%. Volumes increased 3%. In Gases-Asia, volume growth was driven primarily by new plants in China. Materials Technologies, again, saw solid growth driven by our Electronics Materials businesses, and our LNG business posted another strong quarter. Pricing was 1% higher, driven by price increases in Gases-Americas and Gases-Europe, and both favorable price and mix in Materials Technologies. We delivered significant operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved 9% and operating income improved 17% despite the lower sales. Versus prior year, EBITDA margin improved 430 basis points to 30.7%, while our operating margin improved 380 basis points to 19.5%. We saw improvement across all our regional Industrial Gases segments and in Materials Technologies. Lower energy pass-through only contributed about 50 basis points. The rest of the operating margin improvement of about 330 basis points was well balanced, resulting from higher volumes, higher prices and lower costs. Higher volumes and better cost performance contributed to our sequential margin improvement. This quarter is a new record for the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Versus prior year, net income increased 14%, earnings per share grew by 13%, and we continue to improve our return on capital employed, which increased by 130 basis points to 10.9%. Now, please turn to slide number 10. You've heard Seifi and I talk about our focus on cash flow and that we do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. As you can see, distributable cash flow increased again this quarter, and free cash flow was up $87 million as we generated higher EBITDA and spent less on both growth capital and maintenance capital. We are focused on optimizing maintenance capital, spending the right amount at the right time and properly supporting the base business to ensure long-term success. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in cash, taxes and dividends. From a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter-to-quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes. Turning to slide 11, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q3 operating performance, I'd like to spend a moment on the non-GAAP items that total $0.18 per share or $60 million pre-tax, all related to our restructuring actions. This includes $24 million for position eliminations and pension settlements, and $36 million for asset actions primarily related to product line exits as we continue to focus on our core business. We expect to see restructuring cost and pension settlement cost in fiscal Q4 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce cost. Excluding these items, our Q3 continuing operations EPS of $1.65 increased $0.19 or 13% versus last year, despite the significant currency headwinds. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.13 per share. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together contributed $0.11. Net cost performance was $0.11 favorable as the benefits from our cost reduction actions more than overcame a $0.10 headwind from higher incentive compensation. As a result of our improved performance expectations for the full year, we increased our incentive compensation accrual in the quarter. In total, our cost reduction actions delivered $0.18 per share of benefit. These benefits consist of lower personnel costs, as well as actions enabled by our new, more disciplined organization. These actions include reducing contractors, consultants, travel and other discretionary spending. Unfavorable currency translation of $0.11 – I'm sorry, unfavorable currency translation was $0.11 as almost currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, our currency exposure is primarily translational as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Interest expense was $0.01 lower. Taxes and non-controlling interest were both $0.02 unfavorable. Our tax rate of about 25% increased 1%. For the full year, we still expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%. Non-controlling interest was higher this year due to the increased value of the minority position in Indura. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Before I turn the call over to Corning, I'd like to discuss the transaction we just completed last week. We purchased all the outstanding shares of our largest minority partner in Indura, which is one of our industrial gas businesses in Latin America. Following this transaction, we now own about 98% of Indura. The valuation was agreed to at the time of the initial purchase in 2012 and will be a use of cash of $278 million in Q4. Because we previously owned a majority of Indura and we're already consolidating results, there will be no impact to reported sales, EBITDA or operating income. But as we now own a larger portion, there will be a smaller reduction from non-controlling interest that should improve earnings per share by about $0.02 to $0.03 per year beginning in Q4. We have used commercial paper to fund this purchase. Now, to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thanks, Scott. The Industrial Gas team continues to improve our business by executing our five-point plan. For the three regional Industrial Gas segments in total, EBITDA margins were up over 500 basis points versus last year. And each of these three segments reported the highest margins in the 11 quarters that we have provided restated financials for. The strong performance was delivered in an uncertain economic environment with modest manufacturing growth and profit headwinds from currency, lower energy prices and higher incentive compensation. On a constant currency basis, operating income for the three segments combined was up 17%. We delivered these results by focusing on what we control. First, reducing overhead costs by restructuring to our new regional organization. Next, under that organization, uncovering issues, embracing the red as we say, and tackling them to unlock operational productivity with a no excuses attitude. This has been an eventful year at Air Products. And I would like to thank the team for grabbing the opportunity we have been given and running with it. The results speak for themselves. With that, please turn to slide 12 for a review of our Gases-Americas results. We again delivered strong results this quarter as significant cost improvements translated into very strong margin growth. Sales of $898 million were down 16% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 13%. The price of natural gas in the Houston Ship Channel was down over 40%. As a reminder, lower natural gas prices have a significant negative effect on reported revenues, a modest negative impact on profits, and a positive impact on margins. Currency, primarily the Chilean peso, Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar, reduced our sales by 3%. However, underlying sales were flat as higher pricing of 1% offset 1% lower volumes. North America liquid oxygen and nitrogen volumes were up mid-single digit, and we did not see any drop-off through the quarter. HyCO volumes were down slightly, but within typical customer demand fluctuation as our refinery customers continue to operate at high levels. Helium demand remained off. On-site oxygen demand from the steel market was lower. And we will have a few quarters of reduced wholesale oxygen sales until that is replaced by retail signing. We also saw lower Latin American demand, particularly in Brazil. Pricing was up 1% versus last year despite reductions in some of the formula-based contracts for liquid products. Operating income of $207 million was up 9%, and EBITDA of $328 million was up 6% as lower costs and positive pricing more than offset profit headwinds from currency, higher incentive compensation and lower energy pass-through. The lower costs were primarily driven by our restructuring actions, lower planned maintenance outages versus last year, and other productivity actions. Operating margin of 23% was up 520 basis points, with about 200 basis points from lower costs, 100 basis points from pricing and 200 from lower energy pass-through. EBITDA margin of 36.5% was up 740 basis points. Sequentially, profits were also up as volume, price and costs were all positive. And finally, as Scott mentioned, we are excited about the significant increase in our ownership of Indura to Latin American Industrial Gases business. And we're looking forward to more fully implementing our five-point plan and driving further business improvement. Now, please turn to slide 13. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa regional business, we saw the benefit of the cost restructuring actions as both EBITDA and operating margins were up over 300 basis points. Versus last year, sales of $455 million were reduced by 16% due to currency, primarily the euro, the British pound and the Polish zloty. Underlying sales were up 2%, with volumes up 1% and pricing up 1%. We saw positive merchant volumes in the UK-Ireland, mixed in Southern Europe, and weakness in Northern and Central Europe. We have seen some negative volume impact in our Rotterdam hydrogen pipeline in part due to transportation fuel imports from the U.S. negatively impacting European refinery operation. We're pleased that our team improved pricing by 1% in this weak economic environment with increases across both packaged gases and liquid/bulk. Sequentially, volumes were up 2%, driven primarily by better LOX/LIN volumes. Versus last year, reported operating income was up slightly as the positive impact from our restructuring actions overcame the significant currency headwind. On a constant currency basis, operating income was up almost 20%. Versus last quarter, EBITDA was up 16% and operating income was up 23% primarily on significantly improved costs, driven by the benefit from the cost reduction and productivity actions. Please turn to slide 14. Gases-Asia delivered another strong quarter, with new plants driving both volume and profit growth. In addition, cost reduction actions helped to increase EBITDA by 12% and operating income by 20%. Sales were up 14% to $418 million, driven by volumes, up 11% primarily from the new plant. There has been some recent excitement in the Chinese markets. I would like to remind you that the majority of our business in China is protected by secure take-or-pay terms. And with the large plants coming on stream, this proportion of our business is only growing. For our most recent project, for Zhengyuan in Hebei, which came on in – stream in early Q3. In addition to having take-or-pay terms, we also have secure energy pass-through terms in our contracts because the customer supplies the energy, in most cases, for these large plants. Occasionally, we see swings in the energy pass-through around customer startups. This has no impact on profit, but it can impact sales. Most importantly, as I have said before, customers are executing their projects, operating their gasifiers, taking oxygen, and we are getting paid. Overall merchant volumes were up low to mid single digits across Asia. Our China retail LOX/LIN business was up mid single-digits, while overall China LOX/LIN was down as we focus on increasing our retail business while reducing wholesale volumes. We still see end market demand growth in China, but certainly, at a slower rate and with more uncertainty than a few years ago. Sequentially, volumes were up 5% with merchant volumes up significantly following the Lunar New Year holiday. Pricing was down 2% as overcapacity in China continues to pressure liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon pricing. Air Products has no new China liquid capacity to bring on-stream, however, others do. Operating income of $101 million was up 20%, operating margin was up 130 basis points, and EBITDA was up 12% with new plant on-streams, restructuring and productivity programs more than overcoming higher incentive compensation and pricing. Sequential profits were up, primarily due to the acceleration of the cost savings from our restructuring actions and improved merchant volumes. We've talked a lot about driving improvement in the existing business and executing our projects in our backlog. We're also very excited to have won a major contract to supply bulk gases to a new Giga Fab Campus in South Korea. This is an example of the Industrial Gases team continuing Air Products' leadership in the semiconductor industry. I will close with a few words on the global gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our Air Separation Unit sale of equipment business, as well as cost associated with the Industrial Gases business which are not region-specific. Our overall sales were flat with last year, although the business mix was different, with lower small equipment sales to the oil and gas market and higher ASU sale. This business mix difference was a profit headwind. Also, last quarter, we had more favorable contract actions than this quarter. We did see lower cost from the restructuring actions that we are taking Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President Materials Technologies: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 15. The Materials Technologies team continues to deliver very strong results, with volume growth and cost focus raising margins by over 500 basis points to the highest levels in the 11 quarters we have provided financials. In fact, our operating margins are up 900 basis points over the last 2 years. Our team is working hard to become more independent within our products, and our people continue to be excited about the potential of our strong portfolio of businesses and leading market positions. They are delivering both safety and business results. Segment sales of $540 million were up 3% versus prior year. Underlying sales were up 7% on 4% volume growth and 3% positive price mix, with a partial offset from currency. Electronic sales were up 18% on a constant currency basis, driven by positive volume, price and mix. Processed materials volumes were up on continued high memory demand. As a result of a tighter supply/demand dynamics, we're seeing improved pricing and have signed a number of multi-year supply agreements with our customers that will improve volume and earning stability in the future. Advanced Materials continues to benefit from our materials being used in our customers' newest and most advanced production lines. Delivery systems was about flat versus last year, but we have begun to see the expected slowdown on a sequential basis. Within Delivery Systems, our equipment sales are holding up, but we will see a decline from less installation work as specific customers have completed their fab projects. Although overall Electronics Materials demand remained strong given recent industry communications, we continue to monitor the potential impact of changing macroeconomic drivers on 2016. For our business, it is critical to look at both macro drivers, as well as customer-specific dynamics. We're often asked about the impact of lower PC demand on our business. Over the long term, we see slower PC demand more than offset with higher demand for mobile devices and the significant computing power in many non-computing devices. There are some indications of more moderate growth for 2016, driven by weaker PC demand and softening consumer demand in the mobile space. In the memory market, there has been some reduction in DRAM pricing given higher supply, but volumes have been holding up as customers bring on new capacity. The NAND market remains strong. Performance Materials sales were down 2% on a constant currency basis on lower volumes across our epoxy and additives businesses, driven by softness in construction, coatings, I&I and oil field. We did see sequential volume improvement, but less than the typical seasonal improvement. As Q3 end market demand was softer than expected, especially North America and China, we remained cautious about the outlook for seasonal improvements through 2015. Versus last year, price is flat, but margins have improved given lower raw material cost and cost reduction actions. The lower raw material costs are having some negative impact in terms of inventory revaluation. Given our business profile and supply footprint, currency continues to be a major headwind for this business. Over the last three quarters, we've been able to capture significant volume growth, and several of our businesses are now running their plants at very high utilization rates. Last year, we initiated several investments to expand capacity in both the U.S. and in Asia. These investments will support volume growth for our existing products, as well as growth of the new product in our portfolio. We're excited about a new Performance Materials production facility that is currently under construction in Pasadena, Texas. This investment of over $100 million will support the growth of our Performance Materials portfolio over the coming years. We are also relocating one of our Performance Materials plants in China to our main manufacturing site in Nanjing, where – which will provide an increasing capacity and operating synergies. We've also made several smaller investments to support growth of a number of new product introductions in our Electronics portfolio. As we look into 2016, we are considering several smaller investments to debottleneck plants, add capacity, and support new product growth of our Electronics Materials portfolio. As I shared with you at the Investor Conference, our capital intensity is much lower than gases, and we generate a high level of free cash flow. Our maintenance CapEx is only about 1.5% of sales. However, we do periodically need to make investments to support new product opportunities and the growth of our overall portfolio. Let me make some comments about innovation as it is critical to the success of our Materials Technologies business. We continue to be very excited about our innovation portfolio. Our Electronics Materials portfolio is delivering strong growth from new products during 2015, and we continue to achieve profits of record for new nodes, which will drive future growth. In Performance Materials, our non-emissive technologies continue to achieve strong market penetration across a number of applications. And our additives business is delivering growth from new product introductions across a number of specialty applications. We are confident in the returns we're getting from our technology investment, and we are committed to maintaining the technology leadership in the market segments that we are focused on. EBITDA of $155 million was up 27%, and EBITDA margins of 28.6% was up 540 basis points versus last year. Operating income of $132 million was up 36% and operating margins of 24.4% was up 600 basis points. Volume leverage, positive price and mix, and the cost benefits of our restructuring actions overcame currency headwind and higher incentive compensation cost. As I said, another quarter of great results by the team. We're executing on and remain focused on our key priorities; safety, top line growth, margin enhancement and advancing our strategic initiatives to drive further business improvement. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Simon for a quick comment on our Corporate segment.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: Thanks, Guillermo. Our corporate segment consists of our LNG and helium container businesses, as well as corporate costs, which are not business specific. Sales were up this quarter as we continue to see higher LNG sales more than offsetting lower helium container sales. The LNG projects in our backlog continue with no delays or cancellations. However, we have seen a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects that will likely impact future results. The improved profitability this quarter was driven by the higher LNG activity. A positive benefit from restructuring actions was offset by higher incentive compensation. Now, I will turn the call back over Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you again, Simon. Now, please turn to slide number 16 for a discussion of our outlook. During the year, on all of our calls, I have said that we are not going to use the weak worldwide economy nor the negative impact of currency translation as an excuse to reduce our guidance that we promised you back in October. So, I'm very pleased to announce that at this time, based on what we know, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 is $1.75 to $1.85 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of $0.14 or 8% over the previous year, and an increase of $0.15 or 9% over our fiscal year third quarter that we are just talking about. This takes our full year 2015 guidance up to $6.50 to $6.60 per share. At midpoint, this represents a 13% increase over our 2014 results and is $0.13 higher than the target we committed to you back in October. This is despite the fact that we don't see any significant improvement in the worldwide economy, and now expect about $0.35 negative headwind from currency translation. As for capital expenditure in 2015, we expect about $1.7 billion, the same number that we shared with you last quarter. We do continue to enjoy a robust backlog with a high level of secure on-site pipeline projects. Most importantly, we are bringing projects on line that are contributing volume, sales and profit. At the same time, we are bidding and winning new projects in the marketplace. As a result, our backlog of $3.2 billion remains unchanged from last quarter, and you can see a list of our major projects in the Appendix slides. In closing, I would like to say that we are totally focused on actions that we can control to deliver on the commitments that we are making here. We are executing on our improvement program, and our plan and our team is working together to achieve our goals. Once again, I want to commend the Air Products team for outstanding job that they are doing. They are driving significant change in the company and working hard to move Air Products forward to create value for our shareholders and customers. At this time now, we are delighted to answer any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. And we'll move on to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hey. Good morning, P.J. How are you today?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good. Good. So, you commented that you will realize the first $300 million of cost savings by next year and the remainder over the next four years.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, yes.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): What is the cadence of this cost savings over the next four years and how do this cost savings break down geographically?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: What – first of all, the cost savings would be across the board in all of our businesses, number one. The second thing is that when I say $300 million over four years, that's obviously $75 million a year. That's kind of the variable cascade approximately.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And you said the geographic spread, is that sort of based on size of business in each region?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think that – I mean, the area that we can see the biggest amount of improvement is obviously our Latin America operations, but they do have room to improve our results in all of the sectors. I would like Corning to make some more comments on this.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. Good morning. So, when we allocated out these targets across the regions, we clearly looked at the nature of the business, the nature of the spend, the assets in each area. So, it's not like a flat percentage for everyone. It's appropriate for each business opportunity.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. And my second question is on Energy-from-Waste. How close are you to getting these plants running and what's your confidence level in the technology? And you talked about divesting these plants in the future. Are you in conversations with your partner there? Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: As far as the construction of the first unit, we are almost done with the construction and we are in the startup. As far as the confidence in the technology, we'll find out. This is one of a kind, first time anybody has built a plant of this size, and we will find out what the technology does, whether it works or it doesn't work. We are in the middle of doing that and I don't really have any significant update for you. As far as being in conversation with anybody, no, we are not in any conversation until we get these plants operating. Because if they are not going to operate, there is no conversation to be had.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, P.J.
Operator: Well go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much, Duffy. Appreciate that.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I wanted to talk through – your volume seemed to be running better than industry so far. How much of those volumes were new plants coming on line and how much is just you guys doing a better job of selling product in already existing markets?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I would like Corning to answer that, but we are not after gaining market share. We are after making sure that we serve our current customers, and most of the increase in volumes are from new plants. But I'll let Corning to comment because most of this is in our Industrial Gases business.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. So, I think if you looked at this regional slice that we have, you could see a large proportion of this is in Asia. And what you're seeing in Asia is the new plants coming on stream pretty much in total, okay? And that's really a large part of the picture here.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And you would expect that because that is where we have made significant investments, and so we are now getting the benefit of that.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair enough. And then just to go back to the cost cuts. So, the two buckets of $300 million, one, you said you'll be at $150 million run rate on the first run by the end of this year, the whole $300 million on a run rate by Q2 of next year, then the second $300 million, you talked about getting in four years. Does that four years include this year just completed or that four-year clock starts ticking as we get into 2016?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It starts as of – when we get into fiscal year 2016.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We are working on that but, I mean, that would be the approximate date.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Thanks, Duffy.
Operator: We'll go next is John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Mr. McNulty, please check your mute button. Hearing no response, we'll move on to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you. Seifi, just wanted to know what turned out better in the quarter than you originally expected? Because I know your original guidance range was $1.58 to $1.60. So, did some of the cost savings occur earlier than expected or was organic growth better in some markets than you thought it might be?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: There were two things. Number one, when we gave our guidance at the end of last quarter, Don, as you know, we have seen really weak month of March and April. And we were very concerned about how the economy will develop, especially in the U.S. Things have turned out better in the U.S. than we thought. The second thing is that our plants in China came on stream sooner than we thought. So, those were the two main reasons. The cost savings are in line with what we expected because we have a very detailed program on that. But the – it was – I mean, we were cautious because of the economy and the plants in China, and those two turned out to be better than we expected.
Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: And then on slide 10, I noticed that your maintenance and growth CapEx was down year-over-year, and Scott talked about the focus on optimizing maintenance capital. So, is the – you've talked in the past, the $250 million to $300 million run rate on maintenance capital. Is the new rates lower given your comments on how you're trying to optimize that level?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No, no, no, no. Please be careful. We are not trying to optimize maintenance. We are trying to – we will maintain and we are maintaining our facilities. And the number that you are quoting, about $300 million in maintenance, is absolutely correct. The issue is that with maintenance, as you know, it's a lumpy thing depending on when customers shut down plants. So, it is going to go up and down quarter-by-quarter. But order of magnitude, $250 million to $300 million is the maintenance cost for Air Products.
Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Thanks, Don.
Operator: We'll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. How are you?
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Thank you. Seifi, Material Technologies, excellent results this quarter. Has this quarter and the last quarter changed your view at all as to whether this belongs in the portfolio longer term?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: No. We have always said that we want to focus on Industrial Gases. So, that has been our strategy and it will continue to be our strategy. I'm very pleased with the job that Guillermo and his people are doing, but we still consider that business, at the end of the day, to be non-core.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And do you have a timeframe for realizing that as being non-core?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: David, don't – I mean, you know that I can't give you anything like that because we are looking at all of our options, as you know. So...
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. Thanks.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Just looking at slide 20, your backlog, I'm counting six new plants starting up in fiscal year 2016. Do you have any update on sort of the time or the cadence of those through the years or – through the year or how we should be thinking about the earnings impact for 2016?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: I'd like Corning to comment on it, but as long – as far as I know, all of them are supposed to come on stream per plant. Corning?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. Maybe just a little recognition for the team. So, these are large plants. It's been a big effort to get them to completion and get them started up. We talked about we've had one come on in this quarter very smoothly. We expect these plants to come on next year likewise, and kind of what you see in that Appendix, that reflects our latest thinking on it.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I guess, I was just kind of looking for a little bit more detail on are some of them first half, are some of them second half, just in terms of as we look at our models.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I think it's – when you're looking at your models, I think it would be wise to spread it evenly across the year.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the – your cash flow statement. There was a big swing for the year-to-date in payables and accrued liabilities. Is that just a function of your reduced head count expense or what's causing that?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Scott will answer that.
Michael Scott Crocco - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah. Thanks, Vincent, for that question. So, biggest swing in working capital is being driven by the incentive compensation. So, we call that – that's an expense that is noncash at this point in time. Obviously, when we get to the first quarter of FY 2016, we'll have a payout, but that's a big driver in terms of the improvement in working capital for the quarter.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi. How are you?
Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good. Thanks. So, just had a quick question. Obviously, in this quarter, you saw a nice kind of cash flow expansion at least on a year-over-year basis. And as your CapEx starts to wind down, your earnings wind up. And I'm wondering, as we look out to 2016, we should probably see some more earnings growth. And assuming the CapEx doesn't rise with it, can you give us an update on what your plans are, what your kind of priorities are for the uses of that cash?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think we – that's an excellent question. I just kind of – it will take a minute to answer that completely. Our – we have always said that we think we will create the greatest amount of value for our shareholders if we take the cash that we generate and invest it in good projects, in organic growth. So, that is our number one priority. And the good news is that there a lot of those projects. So, whatever cash we generate, I think we will have a good use for it to promote organic growth. If for some reason, because of all bad economic conditions and so on, there are no such opportunities, then the next best use of cash is for accretive, good acquisitions. Then, if there are no such thing as that, then the third thing, we think, is to return it to shareholders in form of dividend or share buyback, depending on where the share price is. So, that would be our priority as we generate cash. But the main thing is our issue has been we've been generating cash. Now that we are generating cash, we have those options. There is one other thing that I'll mention – I would like to mention and we have said this before, we are very focused on making sure that we maintain our A rating. So – we always need to make sure that we have enough cash to maintain the A rating that we have. We don't want to lose that. Therefore, that means we are not going to go on do what I don't think makes sense, is borrow many and buy shares in order to prop up the share price. Okay?
Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thanks. That's really helpful. And if you can, could you also provide – as you're looking out for the best growth projects, as you're looking to build your pipeline, is there a specific region or a specific end market that is particularly attractive to you based on what you're seeing right now?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Obviously, right now, there is significant amount of opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast because of all of the chemical projects that are under consideration. There are significant opportunities around the world for hydrogen. We are the leader in hydrogen, and as a result of that, that creates a lot of opportunities for us. So, the opportunities are worldwide, but obviously and proportionally, there are more opportunities in the U.S. And we are very well positioned in the U.S., and we think that we will get our fair share of the market.
Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): First off, wondering about your decision to increase the ownership position in Indura. I think it was a year ago, you had mentioned that the purchase price assumptions were incorrect in some way. And I'm wondering, based on the predetermined price, can you talk about how you got comfortable with the valuation parameters this time around and just the strategic intent of increasing your ownership there?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'm very happy that you asked the question. We did not decide to buy the shares. I wouldn't have bought the shares. The – as part of the original agreement, the sellers had a put option on Air Products. And obviously, it was a good price, though they put it to us. We had no choice. If we had the choice, we wouldn't have bought it at the price. We would have liked to – but it was a put option, so they put it to us, they have to live by the contract that was negotiated at the time the purchase price was done. So, the good news is that now, at least, we are in full control, and we can do what we need in improving that business. But it wasn't as if we sat down and decided that, gee, this is a great thing to do.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And second, your new board member is experienced, seems very deep in M&A. Is there any information content there as it relates to your pace of mergers, acquisitions, divestitures going forward or is that just, like you said, filling a gap that you might have had?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It is just filling a gap. I think it's the second thing that you said. We just look at the board, and a board of any company is supposed to be a collection of people with different skills, and this was an area where we didn't have the skill, and I think it was – we are very fortunate that Mr. Cogut has agreed to serve on our board. He's – we all have a great deal of respect for him. He is very well-known, and I think he will be a very good addition to our board.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll go next to John Roberts with UBS.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Back to the Indura deal, the original deal was $884 million for 67%, and now, you're paying $278 million for 30.5%. So, if you just scaled on the ownership, it's about a 30% lower price for the same percent of ownership. Is Indura down more than 30%? Is that your comment there about you wouldn't have bought it? It seems like a materially lower price for this similar amount of ownership.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It's just pure luck because it's currency, because the deal was in Chilean pesos.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Got it.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: And as a result, the value in terms of dollars has gone down.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: And then, Corning, on the volumes in China, the remaining big plants come up in phases. I assume once you're fully ramped, you'll be more subject to the macros there. How much longer before you're fully ramped in China? We have more than four quarters left of ramping to go on there or does it extend even beyond that?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Well – Corning will answer that? Go ahead.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. So, I think, to some degree, the answer to your question is in that table. So, you can look at when the plants come on. As those come on, each one of them represents a step change from that. There's the potential that we would identify additional attractive investments between now and then, but I think that's sort of your roadmap.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. The ones that come up in phases, are they relatively linear? See, you've got some asterisks in that table.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. So, I think you would expect, as Seifi said earlier, that you're just going to see this spread out over the course of the next fiscal year.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC: Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on Laurence. Just one quick question on Materials Technologies. You said in Performance Materials, you're seeing some softness in construction and in oilfield. Well, oilfield is obviously known. I was just wondering where you're seeing the weakness in construction. Is there is a specific region or just a specific area? Just a little color on that.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Guillermo will answer that.
Guillermo Novo - Executive Vice President Materials Technologies: Yeah. A lot of our business – we're more on the industrial and protective coatings and floorings. So, it's more of the non-residential construction, and we're seeing most of that in the U.S., some softness versus our expectations, and in Asia, mostly around China.
Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations again on an excellent quarter, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much. You're very kind. Thanks.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. On the backlog, $3.2 billion, a pretty solid figure here. I'm just wondering if you could give your outlook for the second half of the calendar year. Would you expect that to move up or down? And how would you characterize the bidding activity there? Is it getting more competitive in your view?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't want to comment on the competitiveness because that's not appropriate. But in terms of the backlog changing, I think some projects will come on stream, they go off backlog, and hopefully, we'll win some projects and we will add it. So, I would not see a material change.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then on the Americas, your pricing was up. I'm just wondering if you could break that out a little bit between Latin America and the U.S. Was pricing up more in Brazil or could you comment specifically on how your pricing is in the U.S.?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Right. Excellent question. So, you can imagine in the high-inflation regions, it is much easier to drive pricing, and really essential to drive pricing. So, in places like Brazil right now, prices are up quite significantly. In the U.S., we have a situation where we have a number of contracts that are under a formula. And as those input numbers, input costs, go down, that becomes a net drag on pricing. Of course, our input cost that we actually experience come down at the same time. So, it's not really compressing margin, as you might think about pricing. That's just reflecting the natural ebb and flow of an index. So, definitely, in our space, there's certainly a higher percentage increase in Latin America.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Harrison with Global Hunter Securities.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Good morning, Mike.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC: Corning, I was wondering if you could walk through what your LOX/LIN utilization look like by region. And in the case of any improvement, is that improvement just volume related or are there any capacity reductions going on?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: So, for the most part, our position right now is, let's say we're in the 70%s on a global basis. So, a little bit higher in the U.S. and Canada, a little bit lower in Latin America. The movement there or let's say the trend line going up is really just going with underlying volumes at this point. Not really significant capacity coming out of the system at this point. And I would say, in general, if you look at it, so LOX/LIN/LAR up in North America, up a bit in Europe as well. I think it reflects just an overall thing that's happening here in Air Products. I mean, this is a company that's going through a huge transformation. Think about where we were a year ago. Think about that graph we saw earlier about our EBITDA trend. I mean, we've been through a big change. And I think it reflects overall, that people are energized by what's happening, and our teams are out there and they're pushing the sales, they're interacting with our customers, and I think we've got some momentum from that. And that's going to slowly impact our overall loading. But it's hard to beat, of course, the global economic environment.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC: All right. And then a question on the hydrogen business. You've talked in the past about the earnings impact of lower natural gas prices in hydrogen. Have you taken any steps over the last year or two years to modify some of your contracts, so that you're a little bit more insulated from the earnings impact of lower natural gas prices, or is it still the case that you keep whatever efficiencies you can generate, and that means fewer dollars at lower natural gas prices?
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. As you can imagine, these are long-term contracts tied to big assets. And it's not super easy to go ahead and modify them. As well as if you think about what we're really interested in at the end of the day is earnings, is profit, okay? And so, there's not a lot to be gained in heavily trying to reengineer that in terms of your face time with the customer. That might change a ratio for us, but it's not going to really change EPS for us, let's say that. So, we're very focused on the things that most drive value for ourselves and for our shareholders, and really not so much an effort trying to reengineer or re-jig the current contracts.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Mike, I think that during the call, I think Scott mentioned that the effect of the lower prices on profitability was minimal.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC: Right. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: It affects our sales quite a bit, but the effect on profitability was not that huge.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you very much, Mike.
Simon R. Moore - Director-Investor Relations: One more question.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: One more question, please.
Operator: Okay. We'll take our final question from Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. With respect to your – the new plant that comes that's in the backlog for Korea, would you help us understand what it was that allowed you to get this plant? And then, if you would maybe qualitatively or quantitatively help us understand the type of returns you're looking at that plant versus returns you had in the past.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: I'll answer the return question. You know that we are not going to take any project less than 10% return. So, the return was higher than that. But in terms of the – we are under constraints from our customer about how much we can talk about it but I'd like Corning to make some comments.
Corning F. Painter - Executive Vice President Industrial Gases: Yeah. So, this is a reflection of having a product line approach. We've – we know the electronics industry, the semiconductor industry very well. We built a standard set of plants that are geared to deriving or delivering the nitrogen, adjust the pressures and purities these guys need, and I think it just reflects the ability to take that (01:03:32) and replicate it. These are plants that we've built before in other locations, and in some cases, for those very same customer, and we'll now be doing it for them in this location. I think it's the power of – when we talk about focusing on the core, this is an example of that. Focusing on an area of strength and continuing to grow from strength to strength.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Understood. Understood. Thank you. And then just a follow-up with respect to your cost reductions and efficiency programs. Obviously, you put all these together when the economy maybe was not so dire, or the outlook wasn't so dire, and things have slowed down in other parts of the world. So, once you're finished with the $600 million or so reduction in efficiency gains, do you expect there to be other opportunities given where the economy is now?
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: We are committed to continuous improvement. So, once we get this extended in the next four years, then we will start thinking about how we can make our operations even better. So, we are totally committed to that. Okay?
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. At this time, I would like to take a second once more and thank everybody on the call. We appreciate your interest. And we look forward to talking to you in three months. Have a great day. Thank you again.
Operator: Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Operator: Welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations.
Simon Moore: Thank you, Orlando. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Air Products' second quarter 2015 earnings results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Our earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our website at airproducts.com. Please refer to the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and at the end of today's earnings release. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call today. We do appreciate your interest in our company. First, let me introduce our team who are on the call today. In addition to Simon, I have Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, Air Products' Executive Vice President responsible for Industrial Gases; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, Air Products' Executive Vice President in charge of Materials Technologies. All of us will be participating in the call and in answering your questions. I'm very pleased to report that Air Products delivered strong results in the second quarter of our fiscal year 2015. Despite significant currency headwinds and weaker economic growth in most of the geographies that we operate in, we delivered good improvement in our safety performance, our EBITDA margins are up 440 basis points versus last year and our earnings per share improved by 17%. This is a significant improvement versus last year and is a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of the strategic actions we have taken in the last 10 months. Our new organization is in place, it is functioning well and delivering results. So before I go any further, I want to thank all of the talented, dedicated and committed employees of Air Products for doing such a great job. What we are presenting to you today is the result of our 20,000 employees coming to work every day committed to serve our customers and improve every aspect of our performance. Our people are the force behind our progress. I certainly consider it an honor and a privilege to be part of this winning team. Now please turn to slide number three, our safety performance. Year-to-date, we improved our lost time injury rate by 28% and our recordable injury rate by 30%. As Scott said during the investor conference, excellence in safety requires focus, discipline, process orientation and execution. These same characteristics are required for excellence in business performance too. The improvement in our safety results which is our number one priority, is encouraging, but we need to move forward to achieve our goal of zero incidents and zero accidents. Now please turn to slide number 4. I would like to continue to remind everybody that our goal is and will continue to be a constant and persistent effort to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Now please turn to slide number 5. You have heard us many times that our goal is to create value for our shareholders. To do that, we are focused on two key elements. One, responsible allocation of capital. Air Products generates a significant amount of cash. We, the management of the company, fully understand that the proper and responsible allocation of that capital is a clear element of value creation. The second key point is that it is not enough to have a strategy. You have to be able to execute it. Strategy without execution is worthless. So we are fully committed to actually execute our five-point strategic plan. Before I comment on our strategic plan, please go to slide number 6 which, in simple words, explains our overall management philosophy. We have shown this slide to you before, but it is important to emphasize the key points that cash is king, EPS doesn't determine the long-term value of the company, it is the share price and the importance of capital allocation in addition to reorganization. Now please go to slide number 7. This in summary is our strategic plan. We have made several presentations explaining the details and our executives have spent a full day at our Investor Conference on March 31 describing how we are implementing this plan. I have this slide as a reference for you. All of the presentations that we have made at our Investor Day are posted on our website for your reference and I highly encourage you to take a look at them if you have not already done so. Now please turn to slide number 8. On Monday, April 20, we announced that Air Products has had the honor and privilege of being awarded a contract to build, own and operate with our partners, ACWA, the world's largest industrial gas complex, to supply about 75,000 tons per day of industrial gases to Saudi Aramco's refinery in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. This is by far the largest contract we have ever won in our company's 75-year history. We did have a conference call to explain this project and the details of that conference call are again on our website. We've included the highlights here for your reference and we will be happy to answer any questions about it later on. The key point that I would like to make is that the award of this project demonstrates that Air Products has the technology, people and the self-confidence to compete for the world's largest industrial gas projects. It also demonstrates that in addition to our focus on improving our day-to-day performance, we are committed to participate and win the right growth opportunities in the energy sector, environmental sector and the emerging markets. Now please turn to slide number 9, a summary of our quarterly results. Scott will go into the details of these numbers, but I would like to draw your attention to the significant improvement in our margins, 440 basis points, a key goal for us to become the most profitable industrial gas company in the world. In addition, despite the significant headwinds from currency of $0.09 per share, we improved our EPS by 17% versus last year and had positive free cash flow. In particular, the Materials Technologies team, operating more and more as an independent business under Guillermo's leadership, delivered great results driven by the strong market position and focused cost and productivity efforts. We continue to be optimistic about the future of Materials Technologies. Now please turn to slide number 10 where you can see our steady progress toward improving our EBITDA margin. We do appreciate that we still have a long ways to go to meet our stated goal of being the most profitable industrial gas company in the world, but the key fact is that we have started on our journey and we are making progress. Air Products is moving forward with the full force and support of our people. I am very proud of our entire team and optimistic and excited about our future. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details and then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks and then we will answer your questions. Scott.
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much, Seifi. Now please turn to slide 11 for a more detailed review of our Q2 results. Sales of $2.4 billion decreased 6% as strong underlying growth of 5% was offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 5% and a lower energy pass-through impact of 6%. Volumes increased 4% primarily from strength in two areas. In Gases Asia, volume growth was driven primarily by new plants in China. And Materials Technologies again saw solid growth across all businesses. Pricing was 1% higher driven by price increases in Gases Americas, Gases Europe and Materials Technologies. We delivered operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved 10% and operating income improved by 15% despite the lower sales. Versus prior year, EBITDA margin improved 440 basis points to 29.4% while our operating margin improved 340 basis points to 18.3%. This is the highest quarterly operating margin in over 25 years. Sequentially, our margins improved primarily due to Materials Technologies and higher sales in our equipment businesses. Versus prior year, net income increased 19% and earnings per share grew by 17% and we continue to improve our return on capital employed which increased by 80 basis points versus prior year to 10.5%. Please turn to slide 12. My presentation at our Investor Conference last month focused almost entirely on cash flow. We do not want to borrow money to pay dividends. This is consistent with the way we are focusing on running the business. As you can see, in our second quarter of 2015, distributable cash flow was up 14% and free cash flow was up $63 million as we generated higher EBITDA and spent less on maintenance capital. We are focused on optimizing maintenance capital, spending the right amount at the right time and properly supporting the base business. These improvements were more than offset by an increase in cash taxes and dividends. From a timing perspective, it is not unusual for items to move around quarter to quarter, particularly maintenance capital and cash taxes. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, we expect to continue delivering higher EBITDA due to our cost-reduction efforts and our capital expenditures should decline in the second half of the year due to project timing. We continue to work towards being free cash flow positive for fiscal year 2015. Turning to slide 13, you can see an overview of this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q2 operating performance, I would like to spend a moment reviewing two non-GAAP items, both resulting from our organizational restructuring actions. First, our restructuring charges totaling $55 million pretax or $0.18 per share. Second, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $13 million pretax or $0.04 per share. As I have mentioned on prior calls, we expect to see restructuring costs and pension settlement costs during FY 2015 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce costs. Excluding these items, our Q2 continuing operations EPS of $1.55 increased $0.23 or 17% versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.22. Pricing, energy and raw material taken together contributed $0.10. Net cost performance was $0.02 unfavorable as the benefits of our cost-reduction actions were offset by higher incentive compensation costs of about $0.15 and an unfavorable impact from other income and expense of $0.04. We have higher incentive compensation costs this year due to better expected performance versus lower incentive compensation costs last year due to worse performance. Furthermore, in Q2, we adjusted our incentive compensation for the first half of the year, so this impact this quarter reflects both Q1 and Q2. Our incentive compensation program is very well-aligned with the performance of each business unit and it encourages action and it rewards for delivering results. Unfavorable currency translation was $0.09 as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. As a reminder, our currency exposure is primarily translational as the vast majority of our products are made and sold in the same currency. Equity affiliate income was a penny higher. Interest expense was $0.03 lower due to higher capitalized interest and lower rates. Our tax rate of 24% remained unchanged versus prior year. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning Painter: Thanks, Scott. As you heard us share at our Investor Conference last month, the industrial gas team around the world is implementing our 5 Point Plan to drive business improvement. You heard about what focus on the core means for Industrial Gases. It means building density and integrated positions on a local basis. We shared what the new organization enables. Not just how we are organized, but how the new organization enables better and faster decisions close to the action. You heard examples from around the world of changes in behavior and decision-making driven by implementing our new culture of Safety, Simplicity, Speed and Self-confidence. You heard a number of examples of local empowered teams making changes in the way we operate plants, manage assets, deliver products, source key materials and services all to deliver improved business results. And finally, you heard how locally aligned rewards where people can see how their actions impact their pay motivates our people and reinforces teamwork. As Scott mentioned, in most areas, we have accrued for higher bonus payouts this year compared to last year. This is great news as it shows the alignment of employer rewards and shareholder value. You can see the impact of these changes in our safety and business results. I would like to thank our people who continue to stay focused and are delivering. Now, turning to a common question, the price of oil stayed in the $45 to $55 per barrel range during the quarter, about half the price as a year ago. As a reminder, we have very little direct exposure to Oil Exploration & Production, probably $30 million to $40 million a year of sales, but we have begun to see a few modest impacts -- some reduction in our liquid nitrogen volumes to the oilfield services market and some impact on our business to the offshore market.  And we have seen a few customers delaying project decisions; although it is always difficult to know exactly why. But very importantly, we have not seen any drop in the underlying hydrogen demand in the Americas as our refinery customers continue to run hard. Finally, as I'm sure you saw, we announced last week that Marie Ffolkes will be joining Air Products next month as the new President, Industrial Gases America. We are excited to welcome Marie to this position. She brings a strong track record of leadership and proven results. With that, please turn to slide 14 for a review of our Gases Americas results. We delivered strong results this quarter as modest underlying sales growth with significant cost improvements translated into very strong margin growth versus a weak Q2 last year. Sales of $890 million were down 14% versus last year as the pass-through of lower energy prices reduced sales by 13%. The price of natural gas in the Houston Ship Channel was down almost 40% to about $3 per million BTU. Currency, primarily the Chilean peso, Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar reduced our sales by 3%. Underlying sales were up 2% on higher volumes and prices. Volumes were up 1% with liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes -- up in North America; although demand was not what we expected in March. As I said, hydrogen volumes remained strong and were up versus last year on fewer customer-scheduled maintenance outages. Helium volumes were down across the region. Sequentially, volumes were down on Latin American seasonality and lower hydrogen volumes in North America driven by customer outages. We see this as normal fluctuations in our pipeline hydrogen volumes and don't see any signs of an overall demand decline. Our refinery customers continue to operate at high levels. Pricing was up 1% versus last year as we continue to see the positive benefit of our pricing actions. Our actions were partially mitigated by contract formula reductions for some of our liquid customers as the price of power and diesel fuel has come down. Of course, we are also seeing lower power and diesel costs. Recall that last year we incurred much higher power costs as rates spiked during the extremely cold weather in North America. Latin American pricing was strong reflecting the inflationary environment. As you would expect, we have profit headwinds from currency and lower energy pass-through, as well as higher incentive compensation. The team was able to more than overcome these headwinds and deliver 7% EBITDA and 7% operating income growth on the benefits of our restructuring actions, lower maintenance costs, volume leverage and positive price. Operating margin of 20.4% was up 400 basis points with about a third coming from lower energy pass-through, another third from volume and price and the rest from lower costs. EBITDA margin of 33.7% was up 640 basis points. Sequentially, profits were down on currency, lower volumes, lower natural gas prices and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by our restructuring actions. And while we are very focused on driving cost improvements, we were pleased to announce this week that we were awarded a new project by Big River Steel to support their hot rolled steel plant in Mississippi County, Arkansas. Consistent with our strategy, our new integrated gases facility will drive density in the local area. Now, please turn to slide 15. For the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, underlying sales and margins were essentially flat. In these market conditions, we continue to focus on cost and pricing action. Versus last year, sales of $449 million were negatively impacted by 15% from currency, primarily the euro, British pound and Polish zloty. Energy pass-through also reduced sales by 2%. Volumes were down 1% as packaged gas and liquid bulk volumes were essentially flat while on-site volumes were down slightly on customer and planned outages. We are pleased that pricing improved by 1% in this weak economic environment. Primarily driven by currency translation, operating income was down significantly, highlighting the need to continue to drive efficiency in Europe. We have taken actions enabled by our new organization and expect these to begin to show in the P&L through the rest of the year, but there is no question that the trading conditions in Europe continue to be challenging. Please turn to slide 16. Gases Asia delivered another strong quarter with the combination of significant volume growth and cost focus driving margin improvement. Underlying sales were up 12% with the reported sales up 7% to $393 million due to lower energy pass-through and currency. Volumes were up 15% driven by new projects. As Wilbur said at the Investor Conference, our large oxygen projects in China are starting up. Customers are operating their gasifiers; they are taking oxygen and we are getting paid. Overall merchant volumes were up mid-single digits in Asia. Our China liquid oxygen and nitrogen business was flat as we increased retail business while reducing wholesale volumes. We still see end-market demand growth in China, but certainly at a slower rate than a few years ago. Sequentially, volumes were up 1% despite the Lunar New Year holiday. Pricing was down 3% as continued overcapacity in China pressures liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon pricing. I am happy to say that with Zhengyuan, onstream now in April, we have no further merchant China capacity in our backlog. EBITDA of $144 million was up 14% and the EBITDA margin of 36.7% was up 200 basis points versus last year primarily driven by the new plants and lower costs overcoming the negative price and currency impacts. Sequentially, profits were down primarily due to currency, price and higher incentive compensation, partially mitigated by the benefits of our restructuring actions. In terms of new business in Asia, we expect to announce a new project award from a large customer this quarter. I will close with a few words on the Global Gases segment. You'll recall that this segment includes most of our air separation unit sale of equipment business, as well as costs associated with the industrial gas business which are not region-specific. Our sales were roughly flat with last year as ongoing project activity was about flat and currency was negative. We had a positive impact from a contract wrap-up this quarter which we don't expect to reoccur. Our nonbusiness costs were flat versus last year as the benefit of our cost-reduction actions was offset by higher development spending. Now I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.
Guillermo Novo: Thank you, Corning. Please turn to slide 17. The Materials Technologies team delivered another very strong quarter with double-digit underlying sales growth, mix improvement, productivity and our cost focus driving margins to the highest level in the 2.5 years we have reported this segment. As I shared with you at the Investor Conference, we have a very strong portfolio of businesses with leading market positions. Our people are excited about our focus on Materials Technologies and are delivering both safety and business results. Segment sales of $533 million were up 7% versus prior year. Underlying sales were up 11% on 9% volume growth and 2% positive pricing and mix. Electronic sales were up 16% on positive volume and price with strong performance from all businesses. Process Materials volumes were up on continued high memory demand. As I mentioned to you last quarter, given the tighter supply-demand dynamics, we are working hard to sign a number of multiyear supply agreements with our customers. This is a significant development for our Process Materials business and should improve stability of volumes and earnings in the future. At the same time, we delivered positive price this quarter. Advanced Materials continues to deliver volume growth from customers operating their newest and most advanced production lines at high rates. We saw good performance from Delivery Systems; although, as I said before, we expect this to begin to decline later in the year. Sequential volumes were down on lower Lunar New Year activity, but price and mix were still positive. Performance materials saw more of the segment currency impact as underlying sales were up 4%. Volumes were up mid-single digits on good end-market demand in all three businesses. Price and mix was slightly negative, but with lower raw material costs and greater productivity, our margins still improved. As you heard at the Investor Conference, innovation is critical to our success in Materials Technologies. We continue to see strong results across the Advanced Materials portfolio in electronics and our non-emissive catalysts in our polyurethane business. Great examples of innovation driving business results, we are also very pleased with the progress of our innovation initiatives in the rest of our portfolio. EBITDA of $148 million was up 27% and EBITDA margins of 27.8% were up 440 basis points versus last year. Both EBITDA and operating margins are at the highest levels in the 2.5 years we have reported this segment. These strong results are despite headwinds from currency and higher incentive compensation versus last year. We delivered leverage on volume growth, positive price, cost margin, productivity and are beginning to see the results of our cost restructuring actions, great results from the team. We are now focused on our key priorities -- safety, quality top-line growth, margin enhancement and advancing our strategic initiatives. All of this to drive further our business improvement. Now I'll turn the call back over to Simon.
Simon Moore: Thanks, Guillermo. I'll just comment quickly on our corporate segment that consists of our LNG and helium container businesses, as well as corporate costs which are not business-specific. Sales were up this quarter as higher LNG project activity more than offset lower helium container sales. We have seen no change to the LNG projects we are executing in our backlog. We have seen some signs of a slowdown in customer decision-making on new projects. The improved profitability was driven by the higher LNG activity. Corporate costs were flat with a reduction from our cost-saving actions offset by higher incentive compensation. Now I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you again, Simon. Now please turn to slide number 18 for a discussion of our outlook. At this time, based on what we know today, our guidance for the next quarter is $1.55 to $1.60 per share. At midpoint, this will be an increase of 8% over previous year. As for all of fiscal year 2015, we are maintaining our guidance of $6.35 to $6.55 per share. At midpoint, this represents a 12% increase over 2014 results despite the fact that we expect almost $0.40 per share negative headwind from currency translation. As I said last quarter, we are not going to use currency headwinds as an excuse to lower our guidance this year. We take very seriously what we have promised investors at the beginning of the year and consider it to be our job to take actions to deliver the numbers we promised rather than reducing our guidance each quarter because of currency fluctuations or economic conditions. We also understand that our guidance implies a strong fourth quarter. But again, we expect that the accelerating benefits of our restructuring will give us the ability to deliver on this forecast. As for capital expenditure in 2015, we now expect for it to be around $1.7 billion which is at the lower end of our previous guidance. This is due to the impact of currency and also our increased focus on all capital expenditures. We continue to enjoy a robust backlog with a high level of secure on-site pipeline projects. The backlog of $3.2 billion remains unchanged from last quarter and you can see a list of our major projects in the appendix slides. Please note that we have not included the significant project that we just won, the Jazan project, in this backlog. In closing, I would like to say that we are totally focused on actions that we can control to deliver on the commitments that we are making here. We are executing on our improvement actions and our team is working together to achieve our goals. Once again, I would like to take a minute and thank all of the Air Products people for the outstanding job that they are doing. At the end of the day, our performance is the result of their hard work. I'm incredibly proud of the 20,000 talented, committed and motivated employees at Air Products and I certainly consider it an honor and a privilege, as I said before, to be part of this winning team. We are working hard to move Air Products forward and create value for our shareholders. Now with that, we are more than happy to answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Matt Andrejkovics: Actually this is Matt Andrejkovics calling in for Vincent. Thanks for taking the call. The decline in the CapEx forecast, can you just elaborate on some of the delays that you are seeing?
Seifi Ghasemi: There is no delays in our CapEx forecast. The CapEx forecast is because of two reasons. Number one, we are focused on doing the right projects and the second thing is that some of the projects that we are doing are coming in under the estimate that we had before. And obviously the effect of currency. There is no delay on any projects.
Matt Andrejkovics: And then can you just comment a little bit on the volume increases in Materials Technologies and also is it possible to parse out the difference in margin improvements that you're seeing from productivity as opposed to operating leverage?
Seifi Ghasemi: I would like to turn that over to Guillermo to answer for you.
Guillermo Novo: In terms of the volume growth, we have seen -- all the segments actually saw good volume growth. In Electronics, again, the consumer side of the market is doing very well. Memory demand is high and our position with the key players that are enjoying some of the growth from mobility from the cell phone markets and other faster growing markets have been very positive to us. And we have been approving a lot of new technologies for the next generation nodes, so those ramp rates have helped us. If you look at Performance Materials, again, it has been broad-based. Again, this is not the peak season for us. The peak season is the next two quarters for us based on weather and seasonality, but we saw robust volumes around the world, including in Europe and some of the segments that we have been focusing on given our differentiation. We haven't disclosed the breakdown on what is driving the margins, but I can tell you everything is contributing; there is no one big hit. As I indicated at the conference call in New York, we have taken actions specifically in the last year, targeted business to drive improvement and that has given us a strong foundation. On that now, we are writing good volumes, good plant loadings, a lot of productivity initiatives at our plants to get higher capacities and yields throughout our networks. The new products that we are launching are impacting our mix, positive mix effect, so all those things are contributing to our results.
Operator: Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi.
PJ Juvekar: A couple of questions. Seifi, when you took over, you started announcing local currency price increases, but with lower energy and distribution costs, I would imagine that getting pricing is difficult, so can you just talk about the pricing dynamics that you are seeing in the marketplace?
Seifi Ghasemi: I will give you a general answer and I would like to turn it over to Corning to elaborate. But, overall, we are still getting price increases in some of the markets that we operate in because of supply/demand and I would like to have Corning elaborate on that.
Corning Painter: So first, just to be clear, anything that is let's say related to our onsite business or our HyCo business, where there's energy in that, you see that all in pass-through. So when we report our pricing, you are really looking at our liquid products that we deliver to a customer and you are seeing that the average price has gone up and down and a little bit, so what is the trade-off of mix, it means customers with higher prices or lower prices. So that's what you see in it. And if you think of what we referred to in North America, you are seeing there the net impact we've been able to achieve in a pure price where we simply move the price up, offset by places where, in those liquid contracts, there's a formula that takes the price down or a surcharge comes down in cases where power costs come down or diesel costs come down and that is fair. And in terms of let's say net contribution margin to us, that really holds us neutral because those costs are coming down for us at the same time.
PJ Juvekar: And my second question is on your maintenance CapEx which was down by 50% which seems like a big cut, was there something in the old CapEx number that shouldn't have been there and if you continue to produce this kind of free cash flow, when does stock buyback come in the picture? Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: PJ, number one, with respect to maintenance costs, that obviously changes quarter by quarter based on the scheduled maintenance and all of that, but, in general, I would like to make a comment that the company was spending -- talk about maintenance costs, it includes the cost of trucks, new trucks, customer stations and all of that. We are running the company on the basis of making sure that all of our plants operate reliably, but we were kind of I wouldn't say as tight as we should be on maintenance costs and we are very focused on that. But I do expect that different quarters that number will go up and down. Overall, for the company, we have said that maintenance CapEx is something like $250 million to $300 million and that is the way we expect it to be. With respect to the free cash, we've always said that if we have free cash, first of all, let's focus on having the cash and once we have the cash then the best thing that we can do to create value for our shareholders is to invest that in organic growth, new projects which are at a higher return than our cost of capital. So that is our number one priority and fortunately, we are seeing plenty of opportunities to do that whether it is on the large projects, on our HyCo projects and all of that and you have seen some examples of that already. Now if you go beyond that, you can always increase the company's dividend and all of that before you get to buying shares. Okay, PJ?
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Ryan Berney: This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just had a question on the energy pass-through, is the level of sensitivity that we saw this quarter versus natural gas and power costs coming down in the Gases Americas segment? Is that pretty indicative of kind of what it would be in the future if those prices were to come back up?
Corning Painter: Yes, there's nothing particularly unique on the way we did the calculation and if things reverse, you just expect a reversal of what you saw in the P&L here.
Ryan Berney: And then because it's kind of a fixed cost structure -- did you get some margin help this quarter and if so, how much versus kind of the sales line coming down?
Seifi Ghasemi: Are you referring to our HyCo business or are you referring on our business in general?
Ryan Berney: On the Gases Americas in general.
Corning Painter: So a lot of moving pieces if you look at the Gases Americas as a whole, so there is currency because we've got South America, we've got Canada, we've got the natural gas, we have the incentive, we have seasonality in Chile and all of that. And if you wash all of that out and you think about norming for volumes, I think we are in a similar range to where we have been.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay?
Operator: Next we will hear from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Can you explain the change in the interest expense from the first to the second quarter? Did your cash interest change or is it a different accounting treatment? Why did you go down so much with your net cash balances or net debt balances not changing very much?
Seifi Ghasemi: Very good. Can I have your other questions and then we can answer them. Interest expense is one. The next one?
Jeff Zekauskas: The second one is your cash flow from operations in the first half is down $60 million, notwithstanding the earnings growth. Is that because you are putting a lot more in your pension? I don't know what you contributed in your pension in the first half of last year, the first half of this year, but why isn't the operating cash flow stronger all things being equal?
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Anything else?
Jeff Zekauskas: That's it.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, very good. I would like to obviously turn this over to Scott to go through the details for you.
Scott Crocco: So in terms of the interest, I would say the biggest driver of interest change is really driven by currency as the main item. And then in terms of free cash flow and I want to just reiterate an important point here. I mean obviously we are looking at the all-in simple free cash flow metric. We looked at a variety of other things as well, but I think the simplicity of our free cash flow metric is very key around EBITDA and then interest expense, cash taxes, maintenance and so forth. There are some other things in terms of cash flow from operations that obviously myself and my team are looking at very closely. Things that we have that go through there for example are severance payments. As we reduce the size of the organization, we get it right-sized. We are going to have severance payments that we don't have in our simple free cash flow metric, but it obviously is something that we are managing. We are obviously managing also working capital and we've had a use of cash from a working capital perspective and we are managing that as well and trying to make improvements there. And so there are some other things too in terms of timing of payments from equity affiliates, earnings versus dividends received and so the key point here is when we look at the free cash flow metric here for this -- the simple free cash flow metric for this quarter, we've turned positive. There's other things that are beyond that, that again the people that need to be managing this are very clearly managing it and it has been a use of cash, but we are focused on improving our working capital. Obviously, we are going to have to make the payments associated with severance, but we are looking to drive improvements in all regards.
Seifi Ghasemi: But, obviously, Jeff, as you realize, those are kind of one-time items that doesn't indicate our kind of operating rate on a steady-state basis, that's why we separate them.
Jeff Zekauskas: What was the pension change in the first half year-over-year in the funding?
Seifi Ghasemi: Scott has that number.
Scott Crocco: Overall contributions, so, again, you've got contributions and then there is the expense which is non-cash, it's on the order of a net favorable, about $30 million or so inside of that and then again inside is also -- there is the severance. The big item that we are seeing here in the second quarter associated with the cash flow that is not in the simple free cash flow metric is severance payments that we've incurred, of course, as well.
Seifi Ghasemi: The severance payment is obviously significant, Jeff, considering what we have [indiscernible].
Jeff Zekauskas: What was it?
Scott Crocco: Our severance payments here for this quarter? About $55 million or something like that.
Operator: Moving on we will hear from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson: Seifi, I think you got a 440 basis points EBITDA margin improvement over the last year. You have cut the gap with Praxair in half from 7% to 3.6%. How much of this is your $600 million cost-cutting program and within that cost-cutting program, have you made any progress yet on the operational efficiencies or is it still all SG&A and functional support costs? And then a related question would be, on your volume growth, as you load up plants in the U.S., what kind of incremental margin should we expect?
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. First of all, Don, as you say, we are 17% EPS, up versus last year despite the currency, the margin improvement of 440 basis points. All of that is related to the cost actions that we have taken. And most of that is on the first $300 million of so-called overhead cost reduction that we've been talking to you about. We have made progress on the other $300 million, but that is still not significant enough to show in our bottom line. It will, starting at the end of this year and in 2016. So then with respect to volume growth, I would like to have Corning comment on that.
Corning Painter: So I think volume growth right now in this current economic environment we are in, looking around the world is not something we want to be counting on going forward. I think if you think about the restructuring we are doing, if we were in very high let's say economic growth, you could maybe be concerned on how you are going to keep up with it. I think if you think about the economic environment we are in really globally today, the cost actions we are taking are perfectly timed for the environment we are in.
Seifi Ghasemi: Yes, but in terms of specifically the question you had about what kind of a margin, with the volume growth, we will expect more than 50% leverage dropping more than 50% to the bottom line.
Don Carson: Corning, did your volumes grow in the U.S. and what are operating rates in your U.S. merchant system?
Corning Painter: So operating growth that we reported for the U.S. was 1% and I would say operating rates are in the high 70%s.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils Wallin: More of a bigger-picture question here. With your backlog of primarily focused on on-site and yet clearly one of your big strategic goals is to increase density, are you going to need to spend some more CapEx to improve the density side of the portfolio or how can you increase density while still keeping your CapEx relatively disciplined?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think, first of all, you saw one example that Corning mentioned. Big River Steel is a very good example, that it would help us build density in one part. But the other thing is that please keep in mind that most of our backlog, the capital for that backlog has been mainly spent. So as we go forward, we don't need to spend $1.7 billion to support that backlog; that is already done. Therefore, we would have plenty of cash in order to still maintain a reasonable CapEx level of expenditure, but we have plenty of cash to support our activities to increase density in different parts of the world on smaller projects which is what we are going to do. I'd like to have Corning add to that, please.
Corning Painter: I think there's a path as well with your current assets to improve your density which is simply customers who are further away. We can think about what our cost to serve them is and what the right price should be and we can think about what that is for our opportunities who are closer to us. These are things that don't change overnight, but with month after month of diligence this is something we can improve.
Nils Wallin: And then just a different question, there is some degree of change in the gasoline pool going from tier 2 to tier 3 in terms of sulfur. How much of an opportunity would you see that in for your hydrogen business?
Seifi Ghasemi: It is very difficult to quantify that right now, but obviously that would be a positive. For us to quantify that at this stage would be a challenge, but until we know more about the details, but it certainly is in the right direction.
Operator: Next we will hear from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy: With regard to atmospheric gases in the Americas, I think in your prepared remarks you'd commented that volumes were not what you expected in March and was wondering if you could elaborate on what you saw in terms of the monthly cadence and what you are seeing so far in April there?
Seifi Ghasemi: I would just like to make a general comment and I'll turn it over to Corning to elaborate on that. But fundamentally we did see a softening of the economic activity in March. I think everybody is seeing that and that seems to be continuing in April. But, Corning, you want to elaborate on that?
Corning Painter: Just to quantify it a little bit. So let's say underlying oxygen, nitrogen, argon liquid volumes we would say were up in the low to mid-single digits for the quarter as a whole and just to say the volumes in March and a little bit the March volumes in April, they are not quite as strong as one would have hoped.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. And then a second question, if I may, on incentive comp. Why did the accrual increase when the earnings outlook did not? And I guess more importantly, how much might have been brought forward into the fiscal second quarter to true-up the accrual? It sounded like you had a fairly large drag there of $0.15 and I was hoping you might help us flesh that out?
Seifi Ghasemi: I will be more than happy to explain that. You see, the incentive system that we have for 95% of our people is based on constant currency. So in constant currency, we are increased -- our estimate -- if it was the same currency, it would be telling you that we expect another -- we would be saying that our estimate for the year is $7. Therefore, we are accruing based on constant currency as an incentive for the people. And since they are -- our people are delivering ahead of the plan in constant currency; therefore, we are required by accounting rules to accrue for that because they are going to get more than the 100% in terms of bonus. In the second quarter, when we saw that, we had to accrue for both quarters because we haven't accrued for that in the first quarter. That is why you see a big number of $0.15 which is really $45 million. So our performance at constant currency is way ahead of the plan. And as I said, 99% of our people -- I am obviously on an incentive basis on EPS because that's the right way, but if we have a plant manager somewhere where we are rewarding them, that has to be on constant currency because that's the only fair way of evaluating their performance. I hope that clears the situation.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey: Just to follow up on that last point then, we should expect that the incentive compensation, all else being equal, should come down by $20 million to $25 million next quarter?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it depends on how our people are performing versus their plan, but obviously in the third quarter we wouldn't have a $45 million charge, sure. It would be a lot less than that.
David Manthey: Okay. And Corning made a comment, something about your liquid nitrogen, oxygen, argon being less than expected in March, I think. And the second point is you said that your hydrogen was up year-to-year on fewer shutdowns and two things. I'm wondering, first, could you address the comment on margin? Second, with the hydrogen, is there a catch-up that you can see at some point in the future when turnarounds accelerate?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all I would like to confirm what Corning said for the month of March. With respect to hydrogen, please note that we are seeing actually an increase in the demand for hydrogen because it seems that the lower oil prices -- people are driving more and the refineries are running harder than ever before. We do not expect a slowdown on hydrogen. We actually expect it to be pretty robust.
Operator: John Roberts with UBS has our next question.
John Roberts: Two questions here. I think Linde reported a pretty big drop in new orders for the equipment side of its business. You obviously scored a big order in the quarter in Saudi Arabia, but you mentioned some caution by customers for lower oil prices, so maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on what your bidding backlog looks like now? And then, secondly, I think this is the first quarter we have seen the pension settlement loss. Will that get to be a relatively large number or will that be just a small number occasionally?
Seifi Ghasemi: Very good. I'll answer the first question and the second question I will have Scott answer that. On the equipment side, as you know, we do not have a very big equipment business like some of our competitors. Obviously, the award of the Jazan project is a significant boost for our equipment business, but the rest of our equipment business is not that significant; therefore, we have not seen a significant drop and I don't expect anything material there, but the Jazan project is going to be obviously a significant boost for our equipment business.
Scott Crocco: And then if I could, I will pick up the second part of the question in terms of pension and settlement. We would expect to see a little bit more going forward. It wouldn't be huge; maybe it's $10 million per quarter or so. Again, the key point here is that we are focused on rightsizing the organization for going forward and we are going to -- we will point that out, we'll non-GAAP it and we will keep moving and focus on the underlying business performance, but I would say, John, it would be in that kind of a range for the next couple of quarters.
Operator: We will now hear from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
Ram Sivalingam: Seifi, it's Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. A quick question for your business heads. Corning, good margin trajectory in Q2. The outlier was industrial gases; EMEA, you said margins should lift as we get through the back part of the year. Can you give sort of any insight as to how the cadence of that is going to flow through? And then for Guillermo, stellar margins, obviously, but as you think about the run rate going forward, how are you thinking about that?
Corning Painter: Okay, so let's start off then with Europe. We have taken a large number of the actions we need to take in Europe. There's always a little bit more of a delay in Europe between the action and when it shows up in the P&L, but we would expect to see a step up in both quarters for it.
Guillermo Novo: From Materials Technologies, I think we are doing well and we see opportunities for further improvement across our different businesses. We have a broad portfolio, so it is six businesses, each one is with their own dynamics. So we are very optimistic that we can continue to drive improvement moving all levers.
Ram Sivalingam: Guillermo, you are referring to sequentially from Q2 into Q3, Q4?
Guillermo Novo: Yes, if you look at sequentially, the next two quarters tend to be the stronger quarters for us from a volume perspective. So those are going to be -- they tend to be the stronger quarters that make our year.
Operator: And our last question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Just a quick one, you spoke a little bit about how Q4 outlook is implied as being a significant step up. It looks to be about a 720 annualized run rate. Over the last seven, eight years, Air Products consistently delivered annual results $0.10 to $0.20 above the prior Q4 run rate. So does that mean that your baseline for thinking about 2016 is really somewhere north of 740, 750? [Technical Difficulty] products should be more nimble. [Technical Difficulty] five, six years or are there some offsets for next year that we should be thinking about?
Seifi Ghasemi: It would be difficult for me at this stage to speculate about 2016. I'm sure you understand with all of the moving parts that there are in the world it would be difficult to do that, but the way you are doing the math, if nothing else changes that is one way of coming to some kind of numbers, but I cannot really comment on that.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay. Well, I would just like to -- before we go away - say thanks again for your questions. Thank you for being on the call and we look forward to talking to you in the near future. Thank you very much.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation.

I am pleased to report that thanks to the hard work and significant contributions of Air Products’ more than 20,000 employees we delivered a strong performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. As you will note, we have materially improved our safety record and increased our earnings per share for the quarter by 16% versus last year. We increased our EBITDA margin by 240 basis points and we are on our way to once again become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. We do appreciate that we still have a long day to go to fulfill our stated goals, but the fact is we have started on our journey to get there. Air Products is moving forward with the full force and support of all of our people. I am very proud of our entire team and their positive response to the most significant organizational and cultural change in our 75 year history. I am optimistic and excited about our future. Now please turn to Slide #3. Our safety performance for the first quarter is encouraging. We improved our lost-time injury rate by 42% and our recordable case rate by 52%. This is a clear indication that our people are actively involved in improving the discipline of operations and distribution and they are fully engaged in implementing our culture of safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence. When it comes to safety performance we do need to do better and we can do better. But the results indicate that we are moving in the right direction. Once again I would like to thank all of our people for their focus and contribution. Now please turn to Slide #4. I want to remind everyone, once again, that our goal is and will continue to be a constant and persistent effort to become the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Now please turn to Slide #5. We have talked about our management principles before, but I want to emphasize our total focus on creating value for our shareholders, cash generation, capital allocation and moving toward a decentralized organization. Now, please turn to Slide #6. In September of 2014, we laid out a detailed strategic plan to move forward. Let me give you a brief overview and update on where we are today on the five key points. On point number one, it is now very clear to everyone that our core business is Industrial Gases and we are totally focused on improving and growing that business. On point number two, I am very pleased to report that we have restructured the company and are operating under the new structure. As I said, this has been a significant amount of change in a short period of time designed to create a simple, empowered and accountable organization. We are now also reporting our results in accordance with the new structure and have also provided you with appropriate historical data. On point number three, we are we are making progress in implementing our company culture of total focus on safety, simplicity, speed of execution, and collective self-confidence that we can be the best Industrial Gas company in the world. This will be a continuous effort in the months and years to come, but I can confidently report that our people are driving the change. On point number four, we have put in place a very robust and vigorous process to review and allocate capital. We examine all projects over $3 million on a weekly basis with the full participation of our relevant executives. On point number five, we have made significant changes to our compensation plans. The details are in our proxy statement. The key driver is to reward our people based on performance of their relevant area of responsibility, create differentiation in pay and encourage focus on EBITDA and cash generation. Now please turn to Slide #7, our quarterly results. The numbers are self-explanatory and Scott will go through the details, but I want to make a few comments. First, that despite the significant organizational changes, our team has stayed focused on controlling costs, pushing productivity, and have delivered a 240 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin. Second, we did deliver a 16% improvement in earnings per share despite a $0.05 headwind due to currency. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details and then I will come back after comments from Corning, Guillermo and Simon to make some closing remarks and answer your questions. Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Now, please turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our Q1 results. After ending FY 2014 with solid performance in Q4, we again delivered improved results to begin FY 2015 on a strong note. Sales of $2.6 billion increased 1%, a strong underlying growth of 5% was partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 3%, and a 1% impact from our decision to exit the PUI business. Volumes increased 4%, primarily from strength in three areas. In North America Gases we delivered broadly higher volumes across most businesses. This included strong hydrogen demand, particularly from our US Gulf Coast customers. In Gases Asia, volume growth was driven primarily by new plant startups in China. And in Materials Technologies we again saw solid growth across all businesses. Pricing was 1% higher, driven by broad-based price increases across Gases Americas. We delivered operating leverage again this quarter as EBITDA improved by 10% and operating income improved by 15% on the 1% sales growth. EBITDA margin improved to 28.2% while our operating margin improved to 17.4%, both up more than 200 basis points versus prior year. Sequentially, our profits and margins were down slightly as we saw lower seasonal sales in North America Gases and Materials Technologies. Overall, costs were flat with operational improvements offset by higher incentive comp. As a reminder, in Q4, we had lower incentive compensation costs across all the segments as a result of our final 2014 year-end payout. Versus prior year, net income increased 17% and earnings per share grew by 16%. Our fourth quarter trailing return on capital employed increased by 20 basis points to 10.1%. This is the first year-over-year improvement in some time. Our Q1 ROCE of 10.6% improved 140 basis points over last year. You can see this in the appendix slide. Both improvements are a result of better operating performance and costs focus. You’ve heard us talk quite a bit about our focus on cash. And we have said that we don’t want to be in a position to be borrowing money to pay dividends. This is consistent with the way we are focusing and running the business. Driven by a strong fourth quarter we were breakeven on this free cash flow metric in fiscal year 2014, a significant improvement over fiscal year 2013. As you can see in our first quarter 2015, we generated higher EBITDA, but this improvement was more than offset by increases in capital expenditures, cash taxes and dividends. It is not unusual for these items to move around quarter-to-quarter. For the remainder of fiscal 2015, we expect to continue delivering higher EBITDA due to our cost reduction efforts and our capital expenditures should decline in the second half of the year as we bring on-stream more projects from our backlog. We are certainly working towards being free cash flow positive for fiscal year 2015. Turning to Slide 10, you can see an overview of the factors that drove this quarter’s performance in terms of earnings per share. Before I comment on our Q1 operating performance I’d like to spend a moment reviewing two non-GAAP items that total $0.05. First, our restructuring charges totaling $32 million or $0.10 per share as a result of our decision to realign the organization. As I mentioned on last quarter’s call, we expect to see restructuring costs and pension settlement costs in FY 2015 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce costs. Also we acquired our partner’s share of a small industrial gas production joint venture. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. And as a result of revaluating our previously held equity interest to fair value, the quarter includes a gain of $18 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share. Excluding these items our Q1 continuing operations EPS of $0.55 increased $0.21 or 16% versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.18. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, contributed $0.04. Net cost performance was $0.08 favorable, as we are seeing the benefits of our focus on costs more than offsetting fixed costs inflation. The impact of the PUI business exit was $0.04. Unfavorable currency translations were $0.05 as almost all currencies weakened against the dollar. Equity affiliate income was $0.02 higher on better costs performance and higher volumes in Asia. Interest expense was lower but offset by higher non-controlling interests. Our tax rate of 24% remained unchanged versus prior year. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I’ll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning Painter: Thanks, Scott. Before I review our regional results, I want to make a few overall comments on industrial gases. We’ve restructured and simplified our business along three principles. First, combining all of our gases businesses; second, consolidating key activities such as operations and distribution within the business; and third, running the business regionally. In doing so we’ve driven true P&L ownership meaning decision making regarding customers, plans, distribution, all of that, is now with our local managers making us more agile, responsive, and cost competitive. As you can imagine, adopting a simpler and less matrixed organization with greater empowerment and accountability is popular. It is something that many employees have been looking forward to. I would like to thank our people, for staying focused on safety, our customers, and delivering today’s results during these exciting times at Air Products. During the same timeframe, since the beginning of our fiscal year the price of oil has dropped essentially in half, obviously that’s a huge change. But it had no discernible impact on our industrial gas business in Q1. Our hydrogen volumes remain strong as did our US Oil Field Services business. Being agile and focused on cost is always important and even more or so in times like this. Our restructuring advances both of those traits and it is well underway. Finally, a comment on helium, as we mentioned last quarter new supply has come into the market, improving the supply-demand balance, while also impacting the industry’s cost structure. At this point, any pent-up demand from years of shortage has been met. Looking forward we are focused on managing price, cost, and volumes, but we do not see helium as material upside in the near future. With that, please turn to Slide 11 for a review of our Gases Americas results. We delivered strong results this quarter with broad volume growth in North America and strong pricing. Latin America market was weak in comparison. We kept a very tight focus on cost and have taken actions throughout the region, which will begin to hit the bottom line in Q2. Sales of just over $1 billion were up 6% versus last year. Volumes were up 4% with liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon volumes up mid-teen digits in North America on strength across our customer base - I’m sorry, mid-single digits in North America. Hydrogen volumes were up significantly over last year, as we continue to see strong demand from refinery customers on the US Gulf Cost, and we had fewer planned maintenance outages. South American volumes were flat with last year. Pricing was also strong up 3% versus prior year with good results across all of the liquid bulk products in North America, and more inflation driven increases in Latin America. Higher energy prices added 2% to sales, while currency reduced sales by 3%, primarily from the translational effect of the Chilean peso moving about 14% and the Canadian dollar down 8%. Underlying sales were down 1% sequentially, primarily due to seasonality in North America versus last year EBITDA grew 8%, increasing EBITDA margin to 33.1%, the highest in the last two years. Operating income grew by 14% as we saw good leverage on the volume increases. We did see lower maintenance costs, but this was more than offset by a prior year equipment sale gain. We saw a positive effect of continued focus on cost, and we expect the benefits of the reorganization to start to ramp-up in Q2. Sequentially profits were down on lower volumes and lower incentive compensation costs in Q4. Now, please turn to Slide 12, for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region our results were essentially flat compared to last year before the impact of currency. It’s always important to manage costs, particularly so in today’s soft economic environment. Our restructuring is well-timed. The new organization structure is in place and a number of actions are underway, we will deliver these savings to our bottom line over the course of the year. Underlying sales were flat versus last year, with lower energy pass through reduced sales by 2% and currency negatively impacted sales by 7%, primarily the euro, the British pound, and the Polish zloty. Liquid bulk volumes were positive, while cylinder volumes were negative, reflecting a general trend of larger customers showing greater strength than our smaller ones. Underlying sales were flat sequentially. Operating income of $81 million and EBITDA of $143 million were both down 5% versus last year, but again, would have been slightly positive without the currency impact. Sequential profits were increased or were impacted by currency, higher power costs, and lower Q4 incentive compensation costs. Please turn to Slide 13. Asia Gases delivered a strong quarter having brought new plants on stream and controlling costs. As we have said, our large onsite customers may experience some delays in bringing their projects on stream. But the core message here is, we are executing our projects on budget. Our customers are progressing their projects, start-ups are happening, plants are running, and we are getting paid. Underlying sales were up 5% versus last year, as volumes were up 6%, primarily on the new plants particularly the large PCEC project. We continue to see price pressure in the China liquid market, although we have somewhat mitigated that by improving our whole sale retail mix. It has been more than two years since Air Products decided to add liquid capacity in China, but we still see new capacity coming into the marketplace. The sequential sales increase was also primarily driven by the new plants. EBITDA of $155 million was up 12% to 38.8% margin. And the operating income was up 9% to 22.7% margin. Obviously, the volume growth from the new plants brings additional costs, but we are still seeing strong leverage. The sequential profit increase was driven by the new plant start-ups, partially offset by lower Q4 compensation. I’ll close with a few words on the Global Gases segment. This segment consists of most of our air separation unit, sale of equipment business and the associated service. These businesses naturally generate sales and profits. This segment also includes costs associated with industrial gas business, which are not region specific. So for example, R&D, product development, management costs, costs which we can leverage globally are in this segment. I am accountable for those costs and by not allocating them I can hold the regional managers accountable for what they directly control. And that’s an example of our new philosophy. In terms of results for this quarter, our sales were down versus last year on lower product - project activity. And we’ll see that sort of variation in this segment. Excluding a favorable inventory revaluation last year, our profits would have been relatively flat. Our non-business costs were flat versus last year and down slightly sequentially. Now I will turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Materials Technologies segment results.
Guillermo Novo: Thanks, Corning. Please turn to Slide 14. The Materials Technologies segment delivered another very strong quarter including record safety performance driven by good top line growth and significant leverage to the bottom line with higher volumes and very tight cost focus. The new organization is in place and delivering on its commitments. We have taken action on our restructuring plans and will start seeing benefits from lower costs in the coming quarter. The team is excited to have full and direct control over all the key elements of their business performance including operations and supply chain. Electronic Materials sales were up 13% versus prior year as we have seen increased demand across all three businesses. Higher demand in process materials was driven by significant growth in the memory market. We are leveraging tighter markets to secure long-term volume commitments and drive pricing. We expect to begin to see pricing benefits next quarter. Advanced Materials continues to grow as customers ramp production of their next generation nodes. And finally, Delivery Systems’ business activities remains at a high level, although we will likely see it drop off later in fiscal year 2015. Performance Materials grew 6% as strong growth across all the businesses more than offset the negative currency impact. Most of our segment currency impact was in Performance Materials business. End market demand remains strong and we are additionally benefiting from share gain and successful new product introduction. Sequential volumes were down 6% on typical materials seasonality and strong prior quarter equipment business in Electronics. Versus last year, EBITDA of $129 million was up 45% to a 24.7% margin and operating income of $105 million was up 63% to a 20% margin. Strong operating leverage on the volume increases, productivity, continued tight cost focus and negative prior year inventory revaluation drove the increase. Profits were down sequentially on lower volumes and lower Q4 incentive compensation costs. Now I will turn over the call to Simon.
Simon Moore: Thanks, Guillermo. I will make a few comments on our other two segments. First, our Corporate segment. Just to clarify, this segment consists of our LNG and helium container manufacturing businesses. For Q1 of last year, this segment also included our PUI business which we exited in December 2013. This segment also includes our corporate costs, which are not business specific. Examples include Seifi’s costs, Scott’s costs and other corporate functions. As we have said before, we no longer allocate general corporate costs to our business units. In terms of results for this quarter, our sales are flat versus last year excluding the PUI business. In Q1 of last year the PUI business had about $35 million of sales and contributed about $0.04 of EPS. This year LNG sales were up and helium container sales were down. Our LNG projects continue as expected and we have not yet seen any sign of a slowdown in development activity, although we will be watching this very carefully. In fact, just yesterday we announced a new order to provide LNG technology and equipment to the Cameron LNG project in Louisiana. This represents our third large order for the US LNG export market. Excluding PUI segment profits improved as business profits were up and corporate costs were down. The other segment is Energy-from-Waste. The Tees Valley Projects continue as expected. For Tees Valley 1, we have already begun commissioning a few of the systems and we expect to be in start-up mode through the rest of 2015, so do not expect any revenue or earnings in 2015 in this segment. In short, no change to what we have told you before. We do see a small ongoing reported loss associated with the land lease and commercial management of this segment. Now, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thanks again, Simon. Now please turn to Slide number 15, for a discussion of our outlook. At this point in time, based on what we know today, our guidance for the next quarter is $1.50 to $1.55 per share. At midpoint this will be an increase of 16% over the previous year. As for all of fiscal year 2015, we are slightly increasing our guidance to $6.35 to $6.55 per share. At midpoint this represents a 12% increase over our 2014 results. All of the numbers that I just quoted are in actual exchange rates. We are not going to use currency changes as an excuse to reduce our targets. As for capital expenditure in 2015, we expect $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion which is in line with what we have told you before. We continue to enjoy a very robust backlog with a high level of secure on-site pipeline projects. The backlog of $3.2 billion is down from $3.5 billion last quarter as we are very pleased to have one of our major projects in China successfully on the stream. As you have heard me say before, we are totally focused on actions that we can control to deliver on our commitments. The new organization is in place. We are executing on our improvement actions and our teams are working together to achieve our goals. Our new structure enables us to reduce overhead costs, which we have continued to improve cash flow and earnings in 2015. In addition, our new organization and our new reward system allows us to be more effective in improving performance of our existing assets and businesses with a laser focus on cost reduction, utilization, and asset management. I once again want to thank all of the very talented, committed, and dedicated people, and Air Products for their contribution and I continue to be optimistic about the future of Air Products and our ability to deliver excellent results. Now, we will be delighted to answer your questions.
Q - John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, John. How are you this morning?
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Great, great, thank you. So a question. With regard to the margin improvements, you’ve gotten 240 basis points of improvement year-over-year. And I guess, and listening to some of Corning’s comments, it sounds like a lot of the cost-cutting initiatives haven’t really started to kick in all that much yet and it’s more - those are more on the come as we kind of look forward. So I guess of the margin improvement that we saw so far on the year to - year-over-year improvement, how much would you say is tied to cost-cutting and efficiency programs versus just volume and pricing coming in and kind of what you would have expected normally anyway?
Seifollah Ghasemi: I would say, it’s about half and half.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then just with regard to the targets that you are thinking about for 2015 in terms of some of the cost-cutting levers that you expect, I know, originally you had said, look, to close the gap to be the best, we need kind of 600 basis points to 700 basis points of margin improvement. How much do you think you get in 2015 based on the cost-cutting initiatives you’ve already put in place?
Seifollah Ghasemi: John, you know you are asking obviously a very good question. But you know that I’m going to dance around in giving you a timing. We have said that, our goal is to close the 600 basis points of gap in EBITDA margin that we have with the best performing in the industry. We demonstrated that we are making progress, 240 basis points is a significant step forward in one quarter. And we will continue working at this thing as fast as we can. There is a lot of other things that can happen in terms of the worldwide economy and all of that. But we are focused on closing the gap as soon as we possibly can, John.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks very much for the color, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning, fellas.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, Duffy.
Michael Scott Crocco: Hi, Duffy.
Duffy Fischer: A question around the comment you made on FX, Seifi. Where you said actual exchange rates, it sounds like what you are saying is come hell or high water you are going to deliver those numbers, no matter what currency does. But can you talk about what type of headwinds you are having to overcome at, say, the midpoint of that number for this year?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Duffy, yes, you are very right in characterizing my comment. The second thing is that overall the headwind for us for fiscal year 2015, where the exchange rates are right now versus 2014 is a $0.25 headwind. That means that if exchange rates were the same as they were in 2014, our guidance would have been $0.25 higher than what we have given you. That’s the order of magnitude of the headwind that we are talking about.
Duffy Fischer: Okay, thanks.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Duffy Fischer: And then, Corning, a question for you on the oil comment you made where you didn’t see really any effect in Q1. Going forward, would you expect that to change? Do you see some puts and takes if oil stays at this lower level over the next year?
Michael Scott Crocco: Corning, you want?
Corning F. Painter: So I think at this point we would say, if you look at what exactly impacts us in oil, let me just kind of put this in perspective. So let’s say exploration and production, what’s our sales into that area? It is nitrogen for Oil Field Services and in Guillermo’s area some chemicals that go into the fracking mixes just to span it, it’s about $35 million of nitrogen we sell into Oil Field Services, it’s like an $8 billion business, and it’s even less in Performance Materials. Now, obviously if there is a big change, it can impact project timing and all of that. But for right now, we’ve fully anticipated that in the guidance we’ve given you.
Duffy Fischer: Great, thanks, fellas.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Corning F. Painter: Thanks, Duffy.
Operator: And we’ll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning, Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, David. How are you, David?
David Begleiter: Very good. Thank you. Very good. Seifi, you mentioned again that your core business is Industrial Gases. Any further thoughts or update on what that means for Materials Technologies long-term in the portfolio?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, we told you that we are not in a hurry to do anything, because I thought, I mentioned this at our July call, that I said that these guys are going to really perform. And Guillermo is helping me prove me right by performing. I mean, look at the improvement that that business has enjoyed in the last two quarters. My God, their EBITDA margins are now 25%, their EBIT margin is around 20%. So we are going to watch that business improve and then, everybody understands what their long-term plan is, but we are not in a hurry to do anything. They are doing a great job and who knows, if they get their EBITDA margins to 32%, 33%, and their EBIT margins to more than 25%, they might suddenly become a core business.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on pricing, Seifi, can you talk about the success of your recent price increase, as well as the overall industry pricing environment?
Seifollah Ghasemi: David, I’m with - I’m not going to make any comments about pricing, David. I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to engage in that kind of a conversation. I apologize for that. My lawyer is kind of - he’s very conscious that we should not say anything about pricing.
David Begleiter: Understood. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much. There was a comment made at one point in the presentation about how your larger customers were doing better than your smaller customers. I wonder if you could just expand on, I think it was specific to a particular region. I wonder if you could just expand on that dynamic and just help us understand what that is and why that might be?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Very good question, Vincent. I think I will have Corning address that, please. Corning?
Corning Painter: Vincent, that’s more or less an empirical observation of what’s going on in the ground in Europe for us right now. Personally, I think, the larger customers just simply have broader exposure to broader markets, including export markets, where the smaller ones tend to be more local. And I see that as probably what’s driving it.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And maybe just as a follow up. Could you just walk us through sort of where merchant utilization rates are in the various geographies and what your sort of outlook is there?
Corning Painter: Okay, yes. Merchant rates are very close to where they were as last time we reported. So that means in North America we are, let’s say, in the high 70s, mid 70s in Latin America, Europe in the high 70s. Asia, I would say is now mid to high 70s, so that’s just slightly down from where we were last time and in part that’s, because with this new on-stream we just brought on some new capacity. And in addition to that, as we rebalance our wholesale/retail, we’ve shed some of the wholesale business.
Vincent Andrews: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: We’ll go next to Jim Sheehan with SunTrust, Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan: Good morning, Seifi. Just with respect to the FX headwind that you mentioned $0.25, and you said that your EPS targets would have been $0.25 higher. Could you just comment a little bit about what you have done to offset that headwind?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Jim, what we have done is everything that we are doing. I mean, I have always said that for us to do what we need to do at Air Products is not the one magic wand, it’s about 10,000 different things that we need to do right. And that is what we are focused on, the whole organization change, the whole focus on every single dollar that we have spent, the organization being rewarded based on specific areas of performance where people have line of sight. It’s just - I can just go through a list of about 500 items that we are doing. Everybody - the great thing is that we have all of our 20,000 people engaged. This is not a one-person job or 10-person job, we need to get all of the organization engaged. I’m very encouraged, because when I look at the safety result and I see a 50% improvement that means our people are paying attention and they are involved. So we have to do many, many, many, many things that we would have done. I mean, whatever the exchange rates would have been, obviously, we would have wanted to have a guidance of $6.80. I mean, that’s what we are working toward. And the currencies are going to be what the currencies are. But I don’t think we should use that as an excuse and say, well, now let’s lower the guidance. We have said, we are going to do something and we are going after that.
James Sheehan: Great, and also one for Scott, thanks for the guidance on 2015 free cash flow outlook. I was just wondering if you could also comment a little bit about how that looks further out, say, in 2016.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco: Thanks, Seifi. So, yes, thanks for the question. So as Seifi has mentioned, we are looking at maximizing the cash flow out of our existing assets driving EBITDA increases. And now we have an organization that is accountable and have all the levers all the way through that incentive compensation targets. So the main thing we are looking to do is drive cash flow from the assets we have. We don’t, excuse me, we don’t have a target in terms of capital spending, we’re going to look at what the opportunities are that are out there. As Seifi had mentioned, every project greater than $3 million comes to him for his review. And I will tell you, the review and the discussion is around why is this consistent with our strategy? What’s the external market, what’s the competitive position, and how do we get a good investment for the risk and create value for the shareholder? So a little bit more background. We do not - we are obviously working, as I mentioned, trying to get to free cash flow positive for this year and looking forward to driving that even more in the future. So don’t have a target per se, but just telling you what we are focused on and how we are managing the business.
James Sheehan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wei Zhang: Hi, this is Wei Zhang calling for Kevin. I just had a quick question on EMEA. So the sales decline seemed to be primarily from FX. Do you expect to see any impact on - from lower volumes basically due to the macro condition over there?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Corning, do you like to handle that?
Corning Painter: So, I think a key thing in our strategy right now is to do the right things, to do the 10,000 small things that Seifi talked to get our cost position right, to get the restructuring. And the overall economic environment, I don’t know that I’ve got any greater insight than you do other than our most recent results. So I want to be prepared for volume moving up or down. I don’t think anybody sees a huge upswing in the offing. But our goal is just to be ready for whatever eventuality plays out.
Wei Zhang: Great, thanks. And just a follow up, if I may. Do you see any cost relief from FX in terms of capital spending for fiscal year 2015?
Corning Painter: So an impact on our capital costs based on the currency shifting, is that the question?
Wei Zhang: Yes, CapEx.
Corning Painter: Scott?
Michael Scott Crocco: Yes, let me comment on that. So first of all, obviously we are not in the business of trying to project out where currency and exchange rates are going to go. What we do is make sure that when we’ve got a project that has difference in terms of revenues and some equipment that’s coming from a different currency, we are going to hedge from a cash flow perspective, we are not going to hedge from an earnings perspective. So in our latest guidance at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, obviously we’ve looked at where the currencies are. Frankly, we’ve got a lot of investment going in in China, we’ve got a lot of investment in the UK. The RMB and the pound haven’t moved that much. And so, our guidance continues to be $1.7 billion to be $1.9 billion. But, again, the key point here is the translation is going to be whatever the translation is going to be. What we are focused on is generating cash for the shareholder. And to the extent that there is any cash exposure, we’ll hedge that for a project, but we don’t - we are not going to have the - hedge the earnings.
Wei Zhang: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Hi, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, Jeff. How are you doing?
Jeff Zekauskas: I’m very fine. The - in the cash flow statement, your cash flows year-over-year were down about 11%, even though your earnings were up 12%. And I think your - I think your guidance for the year or your talk for the year is that, you wish to be free cash flow positive. Just being free cash flow positive is not really very much growth in operating cash flow. Was there something unusual that happened in the first quarter? And in general, what kind of growth are you expecting from your cash from operations this year?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Very good question. Scott is going to answer that.
Michael Scott Crocco: Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. Good question. So again as I mentioned, and Seifi has been very clear around the simplified cash flow metric. It is very straightforward, it is clear, where it’s consistent between the internal organization, all the way to the outside. And again, as has been mentioned, there is EBITDA targets down through the organization. Clearly, though, then there is some of us at Air Products that are managing the full cash flow beyond the simplified approach. So examples that we saw in this quarter, for example, were pension contributions, about $76 million of pension contributions. We had some cash associated with the severance actions we are taking, and we also had a little bit in terms of the earnings that we recognized from our affiliates versus the timing that we received those dividends. So we are managing that, as well as receivables and so on and so forth. We are trying to make sure that we are optimizing all of that, but recognize again the simplified free cash flow mechanism is just that, it’s clear, it’s simple, and it’s got alignment between inside the organization and outside.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then for my follow-up. Last year in the first quarter, there were large maintenance expenses, especially in the United States, and there were some outage issues. What was the change in maintenance costs year-over-year in the first quarter?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Corning will answer that, Jeff, because it’s mainly in industrial gases.
Corning Painter: Yes. So I don’t know that I have the number fluid for you in the second, but I just want to clarify. So these are maintenance outages by and large which a large refinery will schedule oftentimes years in advance, and then during that outage when they don’t need the product, we and other suppliers all do our outages. So we can follow up with you on what the exact swing was quarter from quarter and we did see a drop off in that. It was offset by a sale of equipment. And I’m being coached here it’s about a $0.01 impact that gave us in the first quarter.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Jeff, just to emphasize that…
Jeff Zekauskas: Sure.
Seifollah Ghasemi: …the difference in maintenance cost translates into $0.01 in earnings per share. So out of the $0.21 increase, $0.01 was lower maintenance costs.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey: Yes, hi, good morning. The 3% year-on-year price increase in North America seems really very high, just given that I assume that’s concentrated in Merchant Gas. And I’m wondering can you give us some color on how you’ve been able to drive that kind of improvement and with volumes remaining as strong as they have, were you that far below market on big percentages of your business, or what’s going on there? I know the market is strong right now, but that seems like a very high number.
Seifollah Ghasemi: I think, Corning, first - I mean, before Corning answers the question, it is the result of having high-quality focused management, but Corning?
Corning Painter: First, I just like to thank you for asking me this question, because although Seifi doesn’t want to talk about pricing in this call, let me assure you when I’m alone with him, there is a lot of questions about how I’m doing on pricing. So I would say it’s a reflection in some degree with supply and demand and increased loading in the market, as well as just a lot of discipline and using tools and so forth to go out and get the pricing that we are entitled to in this market. We give our customers good service and we are entitled to our pricing.
David Manthey: Okay, so it’s just blocking and tackling, looks good though. Congratulations, it’s a good number.
Corning Painter: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you for your comment. We very much appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Hey, P.J., how are you today?
P.J. Juvekar: Good, good. Seifi, you had talked about increasing asset density as one of the key reasons for going to a regional structure. Can you tell us on that, where do you stand on that? How do we measure the performance of that from outside?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, quite frankly, I think, one of the measures would be to see how we are doing in terms of pricing and volumes. I mean that - if you have that kind of a stuff that you will be able to get the kind of numbers we are talking about in terms of pricing. But we have not, P.J., as you know, in the last two quarters done anything dramatic in terms of buying somebody or building an asset or anything like that. So we haven’t done that. We certainly look for opportunities to be able to do that. But improvements in the result is not any significant structural change, it’s just the blocking and tackling that Corning was talking about before.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And then secondly, a few companies have talked about delays in coal gasification, secure projects, I think Corning mentioned that. So what are you seeing in the backlog in terms of any potential delays either due to the oil price or slow China growth, et cetera?
Seifollah Ghasemi: On that one I can say that on the existing projects that we have and their execution, we are not seeing, and we don’t expect to see any change or any cancellations due to lower oil prices. Those projects are solid. They are under construction, and we don’t have any indication of anything happening to that. As far as any prospective future ones, P.J., we just have to wait and see. It’s difficult to make predictions about that.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: We’ll go next to John Roberts with UBS.
John Roberts: Thank you. Do you have a raw material index for the Materials segment and some indication of where raw materials are entering the March quarter versus where they were a year ago?
Seifollah Ghasemi: I will have Guillermo answer that, because raw materials are really only relevant in his business. Fortunately, raw material for the rest of our business is air and natural gas, which seems to be at very low prices these days.
John Roberts: Correct, I was just asking about Materials.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Yes. Thank you, sir.
Guillermo Novo: If you look at our portfolio Electronics and Performance Materials, first in Electronics, probably we are not seeing - the oil impact, that kind of thing is not a big impact on our raw materials. We are seeing some changes, but it’s really around some of the supply/demand dynamics on metals and other materials that we use on different parts of our products. And the material component is an important factor, but costs - the conversion costs, the shipping, the whole supply chain is very complex, so there is a lot of different drivers in Electronics. So the bigger raw material purchase is really more on our Performance Materials business. We are seeing some changes there. Most of raw materials are not - I mean oil, ethylene, propylene in some products have some impact, but we are seeing, it’s not the biggest driver for the types of raw materials that we are driving. So again, supply and demand dynamics and some raw materials are really driving where our costs are going. So we will probably see some cost reductions, but not as much as we expected. A good example of that would be for example EO, the ethylene prices are coming down, but that material, the tightness is really dictating the price. So we should get some improvement, but it’s going to vary a lot by business.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, sir.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs
Bob Koort: Thanks for me come in. Two questions if I might. Seifi, you’ve taken a pretty, I guess, low-key approach to some of the head count reduction in terms of sizing it and how fast and how furious. But it seems like you’ve maybe reduced head count by about 500 so far. Can you talk about what the anticipated benefit from that would be, and then any anticipated additional moves that would be forthcoming?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, Bob. First of all we would have waited until you asked a question anyway. We wouldn’t have ended the call without your question. So just - I just wanted to make sure you know that. In terms of 500 people, that’s kind of the number that is in the footnotes. Order of magnitude what saving that would result to is order of magnitude about $50 million to $60 million.
Bob Koort: Okay.
Seifollah Ghasemi: On an annual basis.
Bob Koort: Right. And, Guillermo, I’m wondering in your business, the EBITDA margins obviously have moved up quite prominently. How does the return on capital in your business compare to the Gases business?
Guillermo Novo: Well, thanks, it’s a very good question. I would say, hopefully, we’ll get a little bit - give a little bit more of a glimpse of that at our coming investor conference, so that you can see a little bit of the feel. In general, we are less capital intensive and our returns are, versus our peers and versus gases, I would say higher and doing very well. And that’s really what we look at. If you look at our improvement to be non-dilutive to the company EBITDA is our target. But to get there, really for us, it’s about our operating margins, because our depreciation doesn’t change that much and our returns on the investments that we make.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Bob, we will try to do a good job delineating that at our Investor Day. But for sure the return on capital is significantly higher, obviously.
Bob Koort: Yes, it certainly makes it seem like it will be a hard decision to not embrace them as part of the portfolio if these trends continue.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, you are asking the question and Guillermo is smiling. So he is happy for your comments.
Bob Koort: Terrific. Thanks, guys.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
Guillermo Novo: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll go next to Mike Harrison from First Analysis.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Good morning, Mike. How are you?
Michael Scott Crocco: Hello, Mike.
Mike Harrison: Doing well, thank you. Guillermo, you mentioned that on the Process Materials side you expect pricing to start improving in the rest of the year. I believe that’s an improvement from what has been some historical pressure on pricing. Can you talk a little bit about what’s driving your more positive outlook there?
Guillermo Novo: Great. Well, thank you for that question. Let me sort of use this opportunity to point out two things. One, as you said, this is the segment that traditionally has been underperforming for us and the industry has over invested, if you look at the photovoltaic history, and if you look at our - a lot of the efforts that we put in the last two years, it’s really been about improving this business. We’ve shutdown production, right sized our capacity, shifted more of our supply to Asia, where we have most of our business. So we are in a much better cost competitive position to supply - profitably supply the industry and that’s driven the improvement. But if you look at the pricing trends because of the oversupply, supply/demand balance, it’s been pretty negative over time. What we are seeing is just things are turning around, especially driven by memory, a few key raw materials have really jumped and that’s really driving the supply/demand balance in a very different direction. So we are fortunate that we’ve done the right things and we are well-positioned to take advantage of this from a cost perspective. But more importantly now we are engaging our customers to make sure that not only we supply them today and that’s the supply/demand is dictating some of the pricing, but also talking about volumes as we look at debottlenecking and adding capacity in the future. We want to learn from the history and this is an important area for win-win for our customers. They require reliability of supply they want to know, they are going to have the material for their needs in the coming years. So we want to make sure that we are reliable with them. But at the same time, we want to learn from some of the dynamics from the past and be very judicious on how we add capacity so that they get reliability, but we also get the returns that we expect on any investments we make.
Mike Harrison: All right. And then just looking at North American tonnage business, I was hoping that you could maybe discuss your expectations for outage activity for your refiners in the rest of the year, particularly as we see gasoline inventories creep quite a bit higher in the US.
Guillermo Novo: Yes, so our current forecast anticipates the outages. I think we have given guidance in general we expect this to be a lower year than last year. Last year was a bit of an anomaly. I guess the thing I would like to stress in this is, these are big outages and they are timed when the customer is already planning to take their units down. So I don’t think there is any changes from any of our customers in a significant way changing around outage plans based on the shift in oil prices right now.
Mike Harrison: Thanks very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. And we’ll take our final question from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson: Thank you. Thank you. A couple questions, one on volume. What you used to refer to as Merchant looks like it was relatively flat as operating rates were flattish. So of your growth in tonnage, how much of it was from new projects versus how much of it was just increased demand for Hico? And as we look forward to the rest of the year what’s the contribution from new projects whether you want to quantify it in either a volume or revenue or earnings per share framework?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thanks, Don. Good to hear from you. Corning will address that.
Corning Painter: So, Don, I think you are referring mainly to America’s when you say that?
Don Carson: Yes.
Corning Painter: Okay. So actually we had volume growth in this quarter in liquid/bulk across all the different products and they were up, let’s say, mid-single-digit. So there was something positive there. We did see good volume growth in this quarter in the Gulf Coast. A fair amount of that is customers who are seeking additional hydrogen beyond which they’ve necessarily contracted for, that gives us a certain amount of the uplift. As we go through the year, as is always the case any on-streams we have are listed later on in the slide deck. But I think the - let me see how to say this, any forecasts, any issues we have on that are sort of encompassed in our current set of numbers that we’ve given you. Does that answer your question? There is no - there is no like the big project coming on in the Gulf Coast the duration of this year if that’s what you are asking?
Don Carson: Okay. But and then globally, I mean, you used to talk about almost a $0.30 number in terms of EPS contribution for new projects. Is the kind of still what you are thinking of in terms of contribution this year?
Corning Painter: Yes. So I don’t think we’ve given out specific numbers on what we expect new projects coming in. You’ve seen the impact of PCEC that was a partial month, we’ll see more of that as we go forward and we have other start-ups coming.
Don Carson: Okay. And, Seifi, just one follow-up on restructuring. Obviously, it’s going a little faster than expected. I know in the past you’ve talked about a $600 million EBITDA benefit from restructuring with half kind of SG&A and half sort of production and distribution efficiencies. Is everything we are seeing today from sort of these overhead cuts, or are you starting to see some efficiencies in the business as well?
Seifollah Ghasemi: We are seeing some, because if you look at our direct margins in terms of before overheads and all of that, the direct margins are up too. So we are seeing some improvements in operations and distribution, but they are not material right now. But I think you will see a lot of that as our organization kind of gets settled down, as our people in the regions and sub-regions get their hands on the details and all of the - as I said, the 10,000 things to do. So I would expect that those would materialize more in 2016 than in 2015, Don.
Don Carson: Okay. Thank you.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well. Thank you very much.
Seifollah Ghasemi: I’m going to make some comments about before we wrap-up, please. We are waiting for the queue from the operator. But first of all, I’d like to thank all of you for being on our call today. But then, I just want to say that we will be holding our 2015 Investor Conference in New York on March 31. And we’ll be - that event will also be webcast. What we will do in that Investor Conference, obviously, we are not going to announce any newer strategy or any new direction for the company, what - where we are going. And obviously we are going to be consistent with what we have told you before. But the key element of that meeting is going to be to giving you exposure to the real people who are actually doing these things. The people who are key executive, who are actually responsible for delivering the results, so that you see that there is a depth of talents within their products, and then I think it’s worthwhile to hear directly from them about what they are doing. I mean, in that Investor Conference are expect to be talking for 10 minutes, and then give our people and other five hours to tell you what they’re really doing. So that’s really the purpose of the meeting, and we are looking forward to your participation. But once again, thank you for being on the call and have a wonderful day. Thanks again.
Operator: And that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] Also this telephone teleconference presentation and comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. Air Products will be recording this teleconference and may publish all or a portion of the teleconference. No other recording or redistribution of this telephone teleconference by any other party are permitted without the express written permission of Air Products. Your participation indicates your agreement. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Anthony. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter 2014 Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO; and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we'll be pleased to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We issued our earnings release this morning. It's available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials.  As a reminder, we will be discussing our Q4 and FY '14 results under our previous segment structure. When we report our Q1 FY '15 earnings in January, we will be reporting under our new segment structure. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on this slide and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you, Simon, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call. We do appreciate your interest in our company. In addition to Simon and Scott, I have both of Air Products' Executive Vice Presidents, Mr. Corning Painter and Mr. Guillermo Novo, here with me to participate in the call and answer your questions. As most of you know, I have been Chairman, President and CEO of Air Products now for 120 days. During this period I have taken the time to meet more than 4,000 of our people in small groups of 50 to 60. As a result of my discussions and observations during these meetings, I am now more than ever convinced that Air Products has a great future ahead of it. Our people are talented, committed, dedicated and enthusiastic to restructure and rebuild Air Products to be the great company it was 20 years ago. The people of Air Products in the last 120 days have demonstrated what they are capable of delivering. Our safety and financial performance in the last quarter demonstrates the power of the 20,000 people in Air Products coming together and delivering results that exceed expectations. Now please turn to Slide #4. Last month we presented our strategy for moving forward. We announced that our goal is to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our people have embraced the challenge, and all of us will work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to get there as soon as we can. In all of our internal meetings we start with a discussion about safety, and I would like to do the same with our investor presentations. So please turn to Slide #5. In the fourth quarter of 2014 we delivered significant improvement in all metrics related to safety. I'm very pleased with this progress, and all of our people will focus on continuing to deliver improvements as we move forward toward our goal. Our goal is 0 accidents and 0 incidents. Now please turn to Slide #6. Last month we presented a detailed road map and the management principles that will guide us to achieving our goals. I would like to highlight the key elements of the management principles. We believe that cash is king. Cash flow drives long-term value. What counts in the long term is the increase in per share value of our stock, not our size or growth rate. I also believe that capital allocation is the most important job of the Air Products CEO right now, and we are very focused on that. In addition, we believe that a decentralized organization releases entrepreneurial energy and minimizes costs and politics. Now please turn to Slide #7. Here are the 5 action points that will drive our performance improvement. The details of these were delineated in our September 18 presentation, which is on our website, but I would like to quickly repeat them right now. Number one, we are focused and will continue to be focused on our core Industrial Gases business. Number two, we have restructured the organization. This is a significant move to our profit centers and a regional focus, and we will report our results accordingly. Number three, we are changing the company culture. We are focused on safety, simplicity in our business processes, speed of execution and collective self-confidence that we can be #1 again. Number four, we are going to be focused on controlling capital and controlling our costs, and last quarter's results demonstrates our ability to do that. And number five, we have realigned our incentive system in such a way that they are totally aligned with the creation of value for our shareholders. Now please turn to Slide #8. These are the highlights of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Scott later on will go through this in more details. But I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that although sales versus last year were up only 3% and sequentially up only 2%, which is in line with worldwide economic growth, our EBITDA grew by 10%, and our operating income was up 12%. This is clearly a demonstration that we are controlling our costs, and I'm very grateful to the organization for responding to the challenge to achieve this. You will also note that our margins have significantly improved. We improved our EBITDA margin by 170 basis points and our operating margin by 130 basis points. Now please turn to Slide #9. You have heard us talk about the focus on cash, and we have said that we do not want to be in a position to be borrowing money to pay dividends. In fiscal year 2014, we had neutral cash flow, a significant improvement over fiscal year '13. As you will -- as you see, we generated $2.8 billion of EBITDA. And by the time you deduct cash taxes, cash interest, dividend and capital expenditure, we end up breakeven. The reason we were able to do this in fiscal 2014 was the significant effort in the last quarter to increase our EBITDA by controlling our costs. Now I would like to turn this over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through the details of the numbers. Thank you.
M. Scott Crocco: Thank you, Seifi. Now please turn to Slide 10 for a review of our 2014 results. After a challenging second quarter, we delivered improved results in the second half of fiscal 2014 and ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter. For the year, sales of $10.4 billion increased 3% on stronger volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, where volumes were up 9% and Merchant Gases where volumes grew 3%. We continued to focus more sharply on cash flow and specifically, EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We have updated our definition of EBITDA to include income from equity affiliate joint ventures and have provided a reconciliation in the appendix to the slides. EBITDA and operating income improved by 5% and 6% respectively on higher volumes. We delivered operating leverage for the first time in several years, as EBITDA improved by 5% and operating income improved by 6% on the 3% sales growth. EBITDA margin improved to 26.5%, while our operating margin improved to almost 16%, both up about 50 basis points versus FY '13. Earnings per share grew by 5%. Our return on capital employed declined by 30 basis points to 9.8% for the year, primarily as a result of our capital spending and higher construction in progress, but remains well above our cost of capital. ROCE bottomed out earlier in 2014 and has begun to show improvement with Q4 coming in at 11%. I want to remind you that the new projects we are developing, executing and operating will be accretive to ROCE over the next few years. During the year, we also remained focused on delivering shareholder value. 2014 was the 32nd consecutive year of increasing the dividend, which we raised 8%. Before I comment on our Q4 performance, I'd like to spend a moment reviewing the non-GAAP items on Slide 11. We conducted our impairment testing and concluded that the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our Latin American reporting unit were impaired as a result of the outlook for Indura, the Chilean-headquartered industrial gases company in which we own a controlling interest. We recorded a noncash impairment charge of $310 million, $275 million attributable to Air Products or $1.27 per share. This is primarily driven by a weaker outlook for the Chilean economy and the balance from the impact of tax reform legislation in Chile that was passed in September. Next are 2 tax items that totaled a positive $31 million or $0.14 per share. A positive $52 million due to a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary was partially offset by a $21 million expense associated with the Chilean tax reform. Also included are restructuring charges and pension settlement costs totaling $18 million or $0.06 per share as a result of our decision to realign the organization. We also expect to see restructuring costs and pension settlement costs in FY '15 as we continue to simplify the organization and reduce costs. Excluding these items, our Q4 continuing operations EPS of $1.66 increased $0.19 or 13% versus last year. Please turn to Slide 12. Seifi provided the highlights of our Q4 results, and I would like to provide some additional details. For the quarter, sales of $2.7 billion were 3% above prior year on stronger volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant segments, and pricing was up 1%. Underlying sales were up 4%, excluding the impact from our exit of our Polyurethane Intermediates or PUI business. Sequentially, overall sales increased 2%, with underlying sales up 3%. EBITDA of $767 million was up 10%, and EBITDA margin of 28.6% was up 170 basis points versus prior year, driven by higher volumes and better cost. A number of you have asked how you can track our progress towards our goals. We will continue to share EBITDA margin in future earnings calls. And while we wouldn't expect improvement to occur in a straight line every quarter, you should hold us accountable for improvement in this important metric. Operating income of $472 million increased 12% versus prior year as we delivered operating leverage on better costs, higher volumes, particularly in Electronics and Performance Materials, and stronger pricing in Merchant Gases. Our operating margin of 17.6% improved 130 basis points versus prior year on a positive contribution from higher volumes and better cost performance. This was the best operating margin performance in at least 9 years. Net income and diluted earnings per share were 14% and 13% higher respectively versus last year. And as I mentioned, our instantaneous ROCE improved to 11%, up 60 basis points versus prior year. Turning to Slide 13. You can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.66 increased by $0.19 versus last year. Higher volumes increased EPS by $0.16. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, contributed $0.02. Net cost performance was $0.04 favorable as we are seeing the benefits of our cost-reduction actions. The impact of the PUI business exit was $0.03. We did not see any net currency impact this quarter. Equity affiliate income was $0.01 lower. Interest expense was lower and contributed $0.02 on lower interest rates. Our tax rate of 24% remained unchanged versus prior year. Noncontrolling interest added $0.01. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Now to begin a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning F. Painter: Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 14. The Merchant Gases segment continued to show strong momentum in Q4. Our focus on pricing and cost enabled us to deliver operating leverage, as Seifi mentioned. In fact, this was the best operating margin performance for the Merchant segment in over 2 years. We are also focused on safety and serving customers while we implement the changes that will drive further improvement in our business. Merchant Gases sales of almost $1.1 billion were up 3% last year on 2% higher volumes and 2% higher pricing. Volume growth was broad across the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Asia, while pricing was positive in the U.S. and Canada, Europe and Latin America. This was our best overall pricing quarter in almost 2 years. Sequentially, sales were up 1% on higher volumes, which were up in all regions except Latin America. For several years, helium volumes have been trending down while pricing has trended up. With new supplies coming into the market, the supply and demand dynamics are changing. While the shortage has eased, the cost structure is evolving with typically more expensive new sources coming online and a change in the U.S. government pricing program. Going forward, we are focused on managing price, cost and sales volumes as we expect sourcing to be less of a challenge. Merchant Gases' operating income of $186 million was up 5% from prior year and up 7% sequentially. The segment operating margin of 17.1% was up 40 basis points compared to last year and up 100 basis points sequentially. Operating leverage from the volume growth, combined with a strong cost focus and pricing results, delivered the numbers. Now let's take a look at the Merchant business by region on Slide 15. In the U.S. and Canada, sales were up 6% on 1% higher volumes and 5% higher pricing. We saw mid-single-digit growth in our liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes, with strength in metals, chemicals and oilfield services markets. Capacity utilization improved within the upper 70s range. We saw lower services and applications equipment sales, and helium volumes were down on supply limitations. Again, we expect helium supply to be less of an issue going forward. Contract signings for the year were ahead of last year's strong results. Helium, LOX/LIN and LAR pricing was positive in part due to the recovery of Q2 weather impacts. As you have seen, we have announced a broad-based price increase in mid-September. In Europe, sales were up 6% from last year on 3% positive volumes and 1% higher price. This was our best European volume performance in at least 3 years, as we continue to see growth in LOX/LIN and LAR volumes while cylinder volumes remained soft. Liquid bulk volume growth was solid across Continental Europe. Contract signings for the quarter were up significantly from last year. Overall pricing was up for the second quarter in a row on helium and cylinder price improvement, while LOX/LIN pricing was flat. LOX/LIN plant loadings remain in the high 70s. In Asia, sales were up 1% from last year as 2% higher volumes were partially offset by 1% lower price. LOX/LIN and LAR volumes were up mid-single digits across the region and up mid-teens in China. Lower helium volumes and lower equipment sales partially offset the liquid volume strength. Over the last -- over the 2 years now, Air Products has not initiated -- for over, excuse me, 2 years now, Air Products has not initiated a new investment for liquid capacity in China. So with the continued volume growth, loadings have improved within the high 70s range. As we've discussed in previous quarters, pricing continues to be pressured, particularly in China, given the industry overcapacity, which we expect to persist for a few years. Contract signings for the quarter and for the year were well above last year. In Latin America, underlying sales were up 2% while currency reduced reported sales by 10%. Brazilian volumes were up, offset by lower economic growth in Chile. As Scott has discussed, we impaired our Latin American business due to our current outlook of lower future profit growth in the business. While the business growth rate and current performance are below our original expectations, Indura remains a profitable business for us. We are focused on cost management to improve the results despite the slower economy. Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our tonnage and Equipment and Energy segments.
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Corning. Please turn to Slide 16. Excluding PUI, Tonnage Gases operating income was up 10% this quarter and up 17% sequentially, primarily due to lower costs. We continue to see strong base business demand, including for hydrogen on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Overall sales of $806 million were down 4% versus last year. Gases volumes were down 1% on lower Europe sales due to plant outages. While we did see some impact on the U.S. Gulf Coast from interruptions in feedstock supply from a supplier and a few customers having plant operating challenges, we continue to see strong demand and little to no impact from the lighter, sweeter shale oil. As we have said, while shale oil availability may moderate hydrogen demand growth going forward, the U.S. Gulf Coast customers are also adding heavy Canadian oil sands to their crude slate, which brings significant hydrogen demand. And low-cost natural gas creates an operating cost advantage for the refiners, allowing them to profitably export refined products. Overall, we may see some growth moderation but don't see risk to our existing assets. Operating income was up 17% sequentially, primarily on lower maintenance costs. Lower PUI volumes impacted sales this quarter by 4% or about $35 million and about $0.03 of profit. As a reminder, we fully exited this business in Q1 of FY '14. And for the full year, saw PUI sales down about $140 million and about an $0.08 EPS headwind. In addition to driving improvement in our base business, we continue to focus on executing our strong backlog of projects safely, on time and on budget. As we said during this quarter, we are seeing delays in onstream timing from some of our large China customers. In some cases, our customers have minor contract flexibility in start dates, but they do not have unlimited ability to delay payments to Air Products. Our customers have not stopped or halted work, but rather are seeing their large and complicated projects take longer to get up and running. We do not see this as a fundamental long-term risk to the returns but it may impact near-term earnings over the next few quarters. Now please turn to Slide 17. The Equipment and Energy segment continues to see strong growth as our leading global LNG position drove the profit improvement. Sales of $125 million were up 6% versus prior year and up 20% sequentially. Operating income of $27 million was up 34% versus prior year and up 57% sequentially. More higher-margin LNG projects and a strong cost focus drove the profit increase. The backlog of $520 million is up significantly as we announced an award for Freeport LNG's export terminal on the U.S. Gulf Coast and an award for a midsized Technip LNG project in Inner Mongolia, China. We've also received other customer awards that have not yet been announced. Overall, LNG project development activity remains high. Now I'll turn the call over to Guillermo for a review of our Electronics and Performance Materials segment results.
Guillermo Novo: Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 18. The Electronics and Performance Materials segment again delivered very strong results as both businesses showed double-digit volume growth, while the focus on cost and productivity delivered leverage to the bottom line. Margins have been increasing over the last few quarters, and this was the best quarterly operating margin in more than 8 years. Segment sales of $660 million were up 14% versus last year, driven by 13% higher volumes. Versus prior year, electronic sales were up 16%. Advanced materials showed strong growth as our customers continued to ramp production of their next-generation nodes, driving increased demand for our materials. Process materials also showed strong growth by leveraging its improved cost position as end-market demand and industry capacity rationalization improved volume and pricing. Delivery Systems was up significantly as we provided equipment and installation services to a number of key fab customers and new node ramps. We would expect particularly the installation portion, which is roughly 30% to 40% of our Delivery System sales, to slow as we move through fiscal year '15. Tonnage also showed growth as we brought onstream new projects. Sequentially, sales were up 14%. Performance Materials sales were up 11% versus last year as we saw strong growth across every region and every product line. End-market demand remains strong, and we are additionally benefiting from share gains and strong successful new product introduction. Sequentially, sales were down 1%, better than the typical seasonal decline. Operating income of $128 million was up 33%, and operating margin was up 280 basis points to 19.3%, as leverage from higher volumes was expanded with strong cost performance. We remain on track and are delivering on our business restructuring and cost reduction programs. Sequential operating income was up 19%, and margins improved 200 basis points even compared to a strong Q3. As I mentioned, the team delivered significant profit improvement and the best operating margins in over 8 years. Innovation-driven growth, pricing, manufacturing productivity, cost improvements and share gains all contributed to the strong performance and allowed us to gain leverage from the improving market conditions. As a reminder, our Q1 results will be for the Materials Technologies segment, which will not include our electronics on-site business. We're excited about the new and more focused Materials Technologies segment, and the team is looking forward to driving further improvements. Now I'll turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Thank you very much, Guillermo. Now please turn to Slide #19. At this point, based on what we know today, our guidance for fiscal year 2015 is for earnings per share of $6.30 to $6.55. At the midpoint, this represents an increase of 11% over our fiscal year 2014 results. We are focused on actions that we can control to deliver these results next year. Our new organization enables us to reduce overhead cost, which will continue to improve cash flow and earnings in 2015. Our new organization will allow us to be more effective and improve the performance of our existing assets and businesses. And we will have a laser focus on cost reduction, especially pricing improvement and asset utilization. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 is for earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.50. At midpoint, this would represent a growth of about 10% versus quarter 1 fiscal year '14. Please note that the sequential drop from quarter 4 of this year is driven by lower seasonal volumes across our businesses and an increase in maintenance costs for our on-site plants. As for capital expenditure for fiscal year 2015, we estimate that to be around $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, as we focus on our core business and, as you know, we have raised our required project returns. You can see a split of the capital by the new reporting segments in appendix Slide #22. I also want to remind you that we will be reporting our first quarter of 2015 results in January under our new segmentation. To help understand the new segments, we expect to provide historical results of the new segments in December of 2000 -- of calendar 2014. Now please turn to Slide #20. I shared this slide with you in September. This is the plan we are following to drive us toward our goal to be the safest and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. This will enable us to accomplish our overall mission, which is to create value for our shareholders. Our new organization is in place. The right people have the right authority and the right accountability for results, and we have the right rewards system in place. We are focused on our core business and we are implementing a culture which is focused on safety, simplicity, speed and self-confidence. We have already -- you have already begun to see the results of our hard work in our fourth quarter results, as we just announced, and we expect that good performance to continue into next year. I continue to be very optimistic about the future of Air Products and the ability of our committed and dedicated people to deliver excellent results as we move forward. Now with that, we are delighted to answer your questions. Anthony?
Operator: It appears we have our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Seifi, since you've taken over, pricing seems to be at the front and center. There have been several price increases announced. I think U.S. merchant price was up 5% in the quarter. So can you talk about your pricing strategy? And how do you manage pricing versus volume trade-off?
Seifollah Ghasemi: That's an excellent question, P.J. When I looked at Air Products' costs during the past 15, 20 years, quite honestly, and the prices that we are getting for the outstanding products that we produce, prices have not kept up with the increase in our costs. I mean, we obviously have to pay our people more. The cost of raw materials go up. We have not recovered our cost increases. And therefore, I think it is imperative for us to push the pricing so that we can at least recover the cost. We are not asking people -- we are very focused on improving productivity and all of that to keep our costs under control. But historically, Air Products has not recovered its cost increases as a result of price. Therefore, we are very much focused on that.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And a question for Corning. You were around when Indura was acquired. And today, you guys wrote down almost 1/3 of the Indura purchase price. So can you do a little postmortem for us on Indura and what went wrong relative to your expectations?
Seifollah Ghasemi: P.J., I'd like to answer that because Corning was not around when that acquisition was made. He was not responsible for that business at all. He had nothing to do with it. The reason that we are where we are is that when you look at Indura's performance, Indura's performance hasn't really changed that much during the years. What had happened is that at the time of the acquisition, the expectations that was put out to justify the purchase price and the goodwill, those assumptions were wrong. There were assumptions for significant growth in Latin America that has not materialized. There was assumptions for synergies that have not materialized. That is the reason that we have to take the write-off. The write-off is not something that we came in and said, "Oh, we have to take a write-off." As you know, in accordance with good accounting practices, every quarter we look at all of our assets and see if they are impaired. And when we looked at all of our assets, the good news is that nothing else was impaired. But then you look at Indura, it was impaired. We had paid too much for the business, and we have to take about half of their goodwill out. So that -- I hope that clarifies the situation, P.J.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maybe a couple of questions on the tonnage business. I think the tonnage volumes for Air Products this year, exclusive of PUI, were down. And I was wondering if you could diagnose why they were down. And I was hoping you could also provide some detail about the delay in China projects, which projects they are and what's the magnitude of the delay?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Very good. Jeff, I'll try to answer this thing in a general way, and then I'll turn it over to Scott -- to Simon to give you more details. First of all, if I may answer your second question first, the delay in the China project is actually, right now, 2 of the projects. I don't want to name them, but it is basically 2 of the projects are about -- delayed about 2 quarters from what we expected. And the projects are -- it is not as if the projects are not viable. It is just that when you are building a $10 billion facility, which we are part of it, there is delays in the start-up and all of that. We do not expect this to be a major issue for us. We do not expect to be taking any write-offs, and we have taken these delays fully into consideration when we gave you our guidance. So it's not as if next quarter, we are going to say, "Well, we have to adjust our guidance because the projects are delayed." We know where they are and we have taken that into consideration. In the long term, we don't see any problems there. With respect to their volumes for our existing businesses, their shortfall in volume is mainly in Europe, and I'll have Simon comment on that.
Simon R. Moore: Great. Thank you, Seifi. And Jeff, I think maybe if I could just frame that, I believe you asked about the full year. And I think as you reflect on the full year volumes in tonnage, first of all, it's contributed by the fact that we didn't have the new plants come onstream. But also as you remember, particularly back in Q2 and Q3, we had a lot of outages that were planned. Our customers planning our outages, we take the plants down, and so that limited our volume opportunities. So as we bring the new plants on next year, we would expect that to improve.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with Crédit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: So with regard to the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, the margins have taken a solid jump up. And I guess I'm wondering if you can parse out what's -- what the major drivers behind that are? How much might be tied to cost cutting versus just the incremental volumes you've seen with the electronics recovery?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Sure, John. I'm going to have Guillermo answer that. But in general, I would like to say that the margins have jumped up because if you recall, when we're discussing this last quarter, I said that, that business has a lot of room for improvement. What we have done is that we have an outstanding team running the place. What we have done is that we have given them authority. We have given them the room to run, and they are doing a great job in running the business. And I think they have a great future ahead of them. I'm very pleased with the management team and the restructuring that Guillermo has done, but -- Guillermo?
Guillermo Novo: I think there are several dimensions that are driving the improvement. First, if you remember last year, we said we were going to drive a significant improvement program in our Performance Materials business, which was one of the underperforming segments. And we have been delivering exactly on that, reducing our costs, improving plant productivity, shifting a lot of our production capabilities to Asia, where we are in a more competitive position. So all those activities that we had planned have been delivered, and that has been a big driver to our overall improvement, so that cost productivity is a big driver. In doing that, as the market has improved and capacity utilizations have improved, we've also been able to take advantage of our competitive position to gain share and improve our pricing position in that area. So that's for the process material side. In the advanced materials, although we started a little bit slower in the first part of the year because of just delays from the industry and the [indiscernible]. Towards back end of the year, we are starting to see that movement, and that's -- a lot of our advanced materials are newer products that come at a higher margin and improve our mix. And lastly, I would say it's in the Delivery Systems. We've also taken productivity initiatives to improve our overall competitiveness in that segment. And we've been able to pick up some additional business during the year, which also helped our loading. So as I said in my comments, there's a lot -- a lot of things have happened, not one single thing that drove our overall improvement.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then maybe just a -- with a follow-up question. On SG&A, we saw a pretty solid drop down, both sequentially and year-over-year. I guess I'm wondering if there's any kind of onetime-ish type items. Or is this just the beginning of the costs cuts to come?
Seifollah Ghasemi: I'd like to have Scott comment on that.
M. Scott Crocco: Sure. So we're focused, as you heard from us in the past and Seifi this morning, on costs and you saw that in the SG&A line. Going forward, where are we going to be next year? We have to continue to drive it down, both on an absolute basis as well as on a percentage-of-sales basis. So I'm not giving guidance in the future for SG&A, but that's going to be a particular area of focus. We delivered results in the fourth quarter and we expect to continue to do so going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Neal P. Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Neal Sangani on for Bob. During the quarter, can you tell us specifically what you did around cost reduction in the fourth quarter? And what's incrementally ahead?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, what we did in the cost reduction is obviously we reduced our staff and the number two is that we controlled travel costs. We controlled all the consulting costs. We controlled all of the -- as you know, it's not one item that you do, it's 10,000 things that you have to do. But I challenged the organization in July when we started, and they have responded. Everybody watches everything that we do. We don't make unnecessary trips. We don't have fancy conferences in fancy resorts. And obviously, there has been people reduction in terms -- in our different businesses. I'd like to have Scott make some additional comments.
M. Scott Crocco: Sure. Thank you, Seifi. So just to build -- just to remind folks, we took a provision last year, and we concluded the savings associated with that provision here in the fourth quarter, $45 million or so for this year with an annual rate of about 75. So we'll see that going into next year. That's been brought to closure. And then also we've taken actions in this quarter under the new organization. And you saw, we've had a provision of about $13 million in this quarter reflective of additional actions that we're going to take, that we have taken and that we're going to continue to take going forward. So just wanted to frame and remind folks that there was the conclusion of the previous efforts and now the beginning of the efforts going forward under the new organization.
Neal P. Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then just a follow-up on electronics. You stated when you came onboard that noncore businesses like Electronics and Performance Materials would need to be improved or divested. How does that fit with the bounce back in volumes and margins you saw this quarter? And can you also tell us what the revenue base in margins would look like once you remove some of the on-site products?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, we challenged -- we have told them that they get their margins up to where the gases margin are. That means an operating margin of around 24%, 25% operating margin, that we would love to keep the business. I mean, it's a great business, great people, and they are making significant improvements toward that goal. So -- and at the rate that they are going, I think that they will be able to achieve that. Guillermo, do you want to make any additional comments?
Guillermo Novo: No, I think I said we're very, very happy with the overall performance. I think one of the questions was around the tonnage part of the business. You'll see those numbers as we roll them out, but it is part of the investor presentation we've made in the past. We break it out. I think roughly you can calculate around $350 million would be the Tonnage Gases portion of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wondering if you could just help us a little bit with the composition of 2015. How much earnings or EPS do you expect from sort of new plant loadings? And then can you talk to us a little bit about how much EBITDA should grow and where EBITDA margins should go for the full year, just so that we could help benchmark your progress relative to what you're asking your employees to do?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, thanks for the question. But we have decided not to really get into the details of how many cents from new plants and how many cents from this and that. We consider that to be a little bit of a getting into too much detail. And in addition to that, if something is delayed in terms of new plants, we do something else to make up for that. So we are not going to really go through that kind of a detail. But in general, I would say that we expect that our EBITDA margins to continue to improve. We are -- as you know, our goal is to get to an EBITDA margin of 32%, 33%. This quarter, we were at around 28%. Next year we will probably be around that and then hopefully, improve every quarter.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just as a follow-up, on the 11% instantaneous ROCE, can you just help us understand how the Indura write-off was accounted for in that?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Okay. Scott will answer that. Scott?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes. So in that instantaneous this quarter, very little impact that you see in there. I think going forward and if I just pull it back, broadly speaking, post the write-down of the LASA reporting unit, call it 20 basis points improvement from the change in the denominator. So that's about the ballpark.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So you took Indura out of the denominator and helped by 20 basis points. Is that the answer?
M. Scott Crocco: As part of a write-down, then the denominator gets lower. And it's about a 20 basis point impact for ROCE going forward, roughly.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Not that significant.
M. Scott Crocco: Right.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just on the restructuring, Seifi, should we expect a large charge going forward? Or similar to this past quarter, smaller charges over the next few quarters?
Seifollah Ghasemi: We are not going to take a onetime one large charge. But I should think that you should expect that during the year, as -- we are going to take the charges as incurred as we do the restructuring. Whatever they charges us, we'll report you. But I expect that if you add up all of those numbers for fiscal year 2015, that would come out to a substantial number if you are going to achieve and do what we have suggested that we are going to do.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Very good. And just on the 2 large China projects that are being delayed. What's the EPS impact in 2015 versus prior expectations?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, David, if you don't mind, as I said, we have taken that into consideration when we gave you the forecast. But I don't want to quote a specific number, if you don't mind.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Question. Now that you've kind of reset the capital bar and obviously getting tighter with capital, Seifi, how do you think about over a longer period of time what the natural growth rate is for your business?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Actual growth rate? Well, it obviously depends on the worldwide economy. But we believe that Air Products has the capacity and we should grow at least at 1.5x GDP worldwide. That would be a natural growth rate.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then expectations among the investment community is for call it roughly $600 million of kind of cost outs from this time you started. Can you walk us through how you think the cadence of that will flow through what you can get? Or maybe what you've got already? What you can get within the next 1 year and then maybe what takes 2 to 3 years to get?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, we expect that out of those $600 million, if we are going to achieve our goal, I think we have said, Duffy, that about half of that will be from SG&A and overhead costs. And the other half will come from fundamentally the runoff facilities and efficiency and distribution, power consumption and all of the other things that we do. So that's the overall breakdown. In terms of breaking it down by years, we'll see how fast we can run. In our forecast that we have given you for next year, obviously, we are assuming that we will have some of that cost saving under our belt. But I don't want to give you a very specific number, but that's the order of magnitude of the numbers, Duffy.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Scott, just wondering if you could give us some color on how you see return on capital trends unfolding over the next year.
M. Scott Crocco: Right. So from an instantaneous perspective, we'd expect it to come down a little bit given the first quarter and the traditional seasonality that we see in the business. But in general -- generally speaking, improvement going forward as we load the assets that we have and bring the projects that are in backlog, and importantly, drive the earnings improvement from the productivity efforts that we have. So we'd expect that to improve going forward as well as all the other metrics that we've talked about, cash flow and so forth.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And one for Seifi, on the cost controls that you've delivered so far are pretty strong. I'm just wondering if you could characterize the cost cuts you've done so far. Would you see that as low-hanging fruits that the pace of cost control slows going forward? Or how do you see that unfolding?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, Jim, my friend, nothing is low-hanging fruit. It doesn't come out easily. But I have to give a lot of credit to the organization for responding to the challenge, and we are controlling every aspect of our cost. And as I said, it's not 1 or 2 items. It's not one magic wand. It's 10,000 different things that people do every day in running our business. So -- and none of that is easy, but -- and it is painful. But the organization has decided that we want to go back to where we were 20 years ago, be the best performing industrial gas company in the world, and they are moving toward that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Seifi, I want to go back to your guidance for fiscal '15. It's above consensus despite obviously some big headwinds out there in terms of economic growth, currency and pension. So 2 questions. One, what is the pension and currency headwind you've built into your numbers? And how would you characterize your growth in terms of how much is cost driven versus how much is really volume driven?
Seifollah Ghasemi: That's an excellent question, Don. First of all, in terms of volumes, you know the economic situation in the world better than I do. We are not counting on getting any significant help from economic growth. So we are not counting that our top line will grow a lot, maybe 2% or maybe even less. What we are counting on is on our ability to focus on the things that we control, which is basically our cost and productivity. And obviously, we are also counting on pricing to make sure that we get the right prices for our products. That's the direction that we are going. In terms of currency, now I'd just like to give you a general number. I know everybody is concerned about the euro and all of that. Our exposure in Europe -- no, maybe we should give you some numbers to frame this thing in a better way that our total exposure to Europe is about 26% of our Air Products sales. But 30% of that European exposure is primarily our pipeline network in Rotterdam. So really, only 18% of Air Products sales are exposed to the economy within Europe. But that includes a little bit of our Performance Materials business. But the significant majority of the 18% is our Merchant business. And of that, 25% of that is in U.K. and Ireland. So we don't really have too much exposure to the U.S. currency today, general economic conditions in Europe. In terms of currency, the biggest swing can come from the -- from euro. And on that one, order of magnitude, 10% change in the value of euro, a 10% change will affect our EPS by about $0.07 or $0.08. So that's the kind of thing that we have done. With respect to pension and so on, I'd like Scott to comment on that.
M. Scott Crocco: Right. I would expect, while it's not final, Don, call it roughly even FY '15 versus '14, not a big movement in pension expense.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Then one follow-up, Seifi, I know you're very focused on improving the density of your assets to improve returns. Have you thought of any closures in the U.S.? I mean, your operating ratio is still only in the high 70s. Are there areas in the U.S. where you don't have the density you need? And could you help yourself out by shuttering some plants?
Seifollah Ghasemi: I don't think we need to shut down some plants. So the density thing can only be improved significantly if we do any kind of swaps with other people. On that one, there are plenty of ideas around, but the issue is fundamentally, what would the authorities approve? I mean, with these things it's always easy to talk about it. But in the real world, there are restrictions from an antitrust point of view about market concentration, about what we can and what we cannot do. We are not counting on that as a significant factor for improving our results. We are open to suggestions. We are open to discussions. But quite honestly, we haven't built anything like that into our forecast.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: If we look at the last 3 years and consider the seasonal pattern from the September quarter into the December quarter, your earnings have declined typically $0.12 to $0.14. Based on the guidance you put forth this morning, if I use the midpoint, it sounds like you're looking for a decline of $0.23 to $0.24. I heard you referenced some higher maintenance costs, and I suppose foreign exchange is not helping sequentially. Are there other factors at work that would be perhaps weighing on the December quarter?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Look, Kevin, the main reason that you come up with $0.24 is because we had an excellent fourth quarter.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, I agree.
Seifollah Ghasemi: You know what I mean? If we had delivered $1.55 and then we said for next quarter, we do $1.50, then you would say it's only $0.05. So there's a little bit of an element of that, but we take very seriously when we talk about giving you guidance. And therefore, we didn't want to get ahead of our headlights for the first quarter. Can we do better? We'll -- obviously, we'll try to do that. But we just want to be cautious that we kind of deliver what we promise, and then so that we don't surprise people.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. I understand. That makes sense. The second question, if I may, Seifi, on the strategic side. If you think about various possibilities such as potential to buy out some joint ventures, and I think you alluded to asset swaps or -- did you see any greater potential today, less potential or about the same, relative to your first day?
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, I see potential, but whether they are actionable, quite honestly, is a challenge. I'm not expecting any kind of a significant happening there, no.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Along the same lines here in terms of the fourth quarter strength and into the first quarter, and I think it was asked before, I'm not sure if it got answered. In terms of -- anything unusual in the fourth quarter in terms of year-end accrual, true-ups? Or anything unusual we should think about that could put that 17.6 in appropriate context?
Seifollah Ghasemi: David, our fourth quarter results are "very clean." There wasn't any kind of a special thing that we moved forward or anything like that. That we feel we have the clean numbers. And if that implies that we are being conservative about the first quarter, maybe there is some element of truth in that. But I would like to have Scott comment on this a little bit more in detail.
M. Scott Crocco: Just I think, as mentioned earlier, when you look at it versus a year-on-year, I think that's the better reference, right? So in any time, any quarter, whether it's sale of equipment and different ins and outs and so forth and seasonality, there's going to be movement. But I think the best way to look at it is how did we do last year? How does that compare to what our guidance is for the first quarter? And again, focusing on the actions that we can control to continue to deliver cost reductions and productivity to the bottom line.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Seifollah Ghasemi: Well, thank you very much. And I would like to just, at this time, thank everybody who was on the call. We very much appreciate your very good questions. We look forward to getting a chance to talk to many of you over the next few months. And I would like to remind everybody that we are planning our 2015 Investor Conference. It will be held in New York and it will be late March or early April as soon as we have finalized the venue for that. We will share more details as we go forward, and we always look forward to seeing all of you. And again, thanks for the very good questions. We appreciate them.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Your participation indicates your agreement. Beginning today’s call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon Moore: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products’ third quarter 2014 results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by Seifi Ghasemi, our Chairman, President and CEO; Scott Crocco, our CFO and our senior business leaders. After our comments, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. We issued our earnings release this morning. It’s available on our Web site along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Please turn to slide two. As always, today’s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on this slide, and at the end of today’s earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much Simon and good morning to everyone. Thanks for taking time from your busy schedule to be on our call. We do appreciate your interest in our company. Let me first introduce our team who will be participating in this call; Mr. Scott Crocco, our Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Corning Painter, who is responsible for our Merchant Gases; Mr. Steve Jones, who is responsible for our Tonnage Gases, Equipment and Energy; and Mr. Guillermo Novo, who is responsible for Electronics and Performance Materials. Now please turn to page three. I believe that at this point it is necessary to answer the question that many of you have already asked me or Simon before this call. And that is why did I take this job? I am here because I believe that Air Products has the people, technologies and geographic footprint to significantly improve its performance. I consider it an honor and a privilege to lead and be part of this exciting time here at Air Products. During the 1980s and early 1990s, I worked at another industrial gas company. During that time, we always compared ourselves to Air Products. Since Air Products was the best industrial gas company in the world. I had during that time a great deal of respect for Air Products’ people and its leadership. I do believe Air Products has the potential to regain its leadership position.  During the past three weeks that I have been officially here on the job, I have met more than 1,000 of our employees in small groups of 50 to 60 people to listen to their suggestions and answer their questions. As a result of what I have seen and heard in these meetings, I am excited, encouraged and enthusiastic about the future of Air Products. I see a team of talented, dedicated and committed people who are ready for change, they are ready to deliver results and they want to regain the respect in the industry that they deserve. With the full support of our Board of Directors and the enthusiastic participation of our talented, committed and dedicated employees, we will move forward to create further value for our shareholders. Now please turn to page four, so that I can explain some of the key principles that will guide us in managing our future. First, we believe that cash is king. We will focus our efforts to generate cash. You will notice the use of EBITDA in presenting our results and measuring our performance in the future.  Second, I consider capital allocation to be a very significant part of my responsibility. We will only allocate capital to projects and activities that will create significant value for our shareholders. This leaves to the third point that in the long run the growth in the per share value of our stock is the true measure of our performance. Sales growth and corporate size is of no value if it does not result in an increase in the per share value of our Company stock. And the fourth point is that we believe high performance people want to be giving clear goals and be empowered to make decisions. A decentralized organization will create lines of responsibility and accountability is the best way to unleash our best people to lead at all levels of the organization and deliver results. So with those comments, I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Chief Financial Officer. Scott?
Scott Crocco: Thank you very much Seifi. Air Products delivered on our commitments in Q3. Our earnings came in at the top end of the guidance range we shared with you in April. We are focused on execution recovering the adverse weather impacts from Q2, bringing our plans on-stream, on-time, on-budget and safely, delivering on our cost reductions and loading the assets we have in the ground. As Seifi said, we have a great team that is excited about the path forward. Turning to slide five, let me now take you through our fiscal Q3 results. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 3% above prior year on stronger volumes across all of our segments. Pricing was up 1% and underlying sales were up 4%, excluding the excluding the polyurethane intermediates or PUI business. Sequentially, overall sales increased 2% with underlying sales up 4% on higher volumes in our three largest segments. As Seifi mentioned, we are focusing more sharply on cash and specifically EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We have provided you a reconciliation in the appendix of the slides. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $653 million was up 7% versus prior year and 6% sequentially driven by higher volumes and new planned on-streams. Operating income of $440 million increased 8% versus prior year as we delivered operating leverage on higher volumes particularly in electronics and performance materials and we delivered better pricing in Merchant Gases. Our operating margin of 15.7% improved 70 basis points versus prior year as the positive contribution from higher volumes more than offset higher cost primarily from planned maintenance outages. As we said last quarter, we expect maintenance cost to be lower in the fourth quarter. Net income and diluted earnings per share were 9% and 7% higher respectively versus last year. Our return on capital employed was 9.6%, 90 basis points lower compared to last year as a result of higher capital employed. This remains well above our 8% cost of capital. I want to remind you that the new projects we are developing, executing and operating will be accretive to ROCE over the next few years. Turning to slide six, you can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter’s performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.46 increased by $0.10 versus last year. Higher volumes across all segments increased EPS by $0.18. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together were flat. Net cost performance was $0.05 unfavorable as higher cost primarily the planned tonnage maintenance outages and inflation more than offsets of our 2012 and 2013 cost reduction programs. We delivered on the cost reduction actions and are seeing the benefits. The impact of the PUI business exit was about $0.02. Interest expense was lower and contributed a penny on lower interest rates. Our tax rate of 24% remains unchanged. And finally, higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I’ll turn the call over to Corning.
Corning Painter: Thanks Scott. Please turn to page seven. Overall, the Merchant Gases segment had a very strong rebound from a challenging Q2. Volumes continue to improve. We showed good cost performance and we successfully recovered the expected portion of the Q2 weather cost. However, I want to be clear. We are not satisfied with this level of performance and certainly have opportunities to further improve this business. But that said, the team delivered on our expectations for this quarter. Merchant gas sales of just over $1 billion were up 4% versus last year on 3% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Volumes were lead by strong overall growth in Asia and the U.S. and Canada and positive liquid oxygen and nitrogen volumes across all regions, partially offset by lower helium volumes globally. Sequentially, sales were up 4% and volumes were up 3% as we saw accelerating volumes in Europe, continued strength in Asia and an improvement in Latin America. Our new helium plant in Wyoming is on stream and our supplier of crude helium continues to ramp production. While helium was still tight during the quarter, we began to see additional industry supply reduced tightness towards the end of the quarter. We would expect the supply and demand balance to shift going forward. Merchant gases operating income of $174 million was up 5% versus prior year and up 21% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.1% was up 10 basis points compared to last year and up 230 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recovered the expected portion of last quarter’s unusual U.S. and Canadian weather related cost and expect this recovery to continue. While we were pleased with the move in our margin, I want to comment on the incremental margin. We shared with you that we expect incremental margins on existing asset loading to be in the range of 30% to 40%. A portion of the sales growth this quarter was not incremental loading of existing assets. The EPCO sales growth was not incremental as this was in acquisition we closed on during Q3 of last year. Also, we shared a number of details regarding the China merchant market in last quarter’s call. As you have heard Air Products and the industry are challenged with the supply that has grown faster than demand. We have not made the decision to add liquid capacity in China for over 18 months but we still have some liquid capacity to bring on stream. New capacity additions don’t earn incremental returns and the pricing dynamics in China also limit margins in the near term. One note as we look to Q4. As Seifi mentioned, we’re going to see a greater emphasis on cash flow from us. As you may remember, when we sold our European healthcare business to Linda in 2012, a portion of the proceeds were contingent on a number of business retenders and we move this business to discontinued operations. The reconciliation is now complete and so we have made a payment to Linda in Q4 of about $158 million. This liability was already fully reflected on our balance sheet and so have minimal to know -- no P&L or EBITDA impact but it will affect cash flow and discontinued operations in Q4. Now let’s take a look at the merchant business by region. Please turn to slide eight. In the U.S. and Canada sales were up 8% on 3% higher volumes and 5% higher pricing. We continue to see nice growth in our liquid oxygen and nitrogen volumes with strength in the metals and chemicals markets as capacity utilization remains in the upper 70s, a full quarter of EPCO this year versus only month of last year was positive but helium argon were both down on limited supply.  As I mentioned we saw some improvement in the helium supply near the end of last quarter but still down for the quarter versus prior year. Contract signings for last year remain above last year’s strong results. Both helium and LOX/LIN pricing continue to be positive as we work hard to continue to recover the Q2 weather impact in LOX/LIN. In Europe sales were up 6% versus last year due to currency as volumes were down 1% while prices were up 1%. LOX/LIN and LAR volumes were positive but were offset by lower helium and cylinder volumes. LOX/LIN volume growth was solid in central and north Europe and we were pleased to see strong end user volume growth in Southern Europe. While construction remains weak and cylinder volumes were down versus last year, we were also encouraged to see slight sequential improvement. Contract signings for the quarter were up significantly from last year overall pricing was up slightly for the first time in a year and half as LOX/LIN pricing was flat and both helium and cylinder pricing showed improvement. The team is very focused on aggressively managing pricing. LOX/LIN plant loadings remain in the high 70s. We were pleased to announce the installation of a new air separation unit for AGC Glass in the Czech Republic, Asahi Glass, the world’s largest producer of flow glass is seeing real benefits from the new plant that are helping them to meet their goals to produce the highest quality glass in an increasingly competitive market. A great example of our industry expertise enabling us to growth relationship that began in also 20 years ago. In Asia, sales were up 5% versus last year on 6% higher volumes and 1% lower price. LOX/LIN and LAR volumes continue to be up double digits in China and across the whole region while helium was down on supply limitations. With the strong volume growth planned loadings have moved up to the high 70s despite capacity additions. Contract signings for the year remain above last year’s strong results. Pricing was down in the LIN, LOX and LAR business particularly in China driven in part by the whole steel market while helium pricing was up.  We shared a fair amount of detail on the China merchant market in last quarter’s call. As we said, we expect the supply demand dynamics to be challenging for a few years but it is encouraging to see an increase in our utilization rates. We remain focused on using our applications expertise to help our customers improve throughput, reduce environmental impact and lower cost while creating new demand for industrial gases. In Latin America, underlying sales were up 4% while currency reduced reported sales by 12%. Brazil volumes were up and we saw a slight improvement in the Rest of South America but slower growth global economic demand, mitigated growth in Chile. We are seeing the benefits of our cost reduction focus on our business. LOX/LIN plant capacity utilization remains in the mid 70s.  Now let me turn the cal over to Steve for a review of our Tonnage and Equipment and Energy segments.
Steve Jones: Thanks, Corning. Good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 9, excluding PUI tonnage gases grew profit this quarter as the positive contribution from new projects and strong base business demand overcame the expected negative expense and volume impact from a higher level planned outages. Base demand particularly hydrogen in the U.S. Gulf Coast system remain strong. Overall sales of $835 million were down 1% versus last year. Gases volumes were up 2%, a strong U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen demand and a positive contribution from new plants, more than offset the maintenance outage impact. I know many of you have asked about the potential impact of lighter, sweeter shale oil on the U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen demand. As you can see from our results over the last few quarters, we continue to see our customers running hard with significant hydrogen demand. While shale oil availability may moderate hydrogen demand growth going forward, our U.S. Gulf Coast customers are also adding heavy Canadian oil sands to a crude slate which bring significant hydrogen demand. And low cost natural gas creates an operating cost advantage for the refiners, allowing them to profitably export refined products. Overall, we may see some growth moderation but see no risk to our existing assets. Lower PUI volumes impacted sales by 4% or about $35 million and about $0.02 of profits. As a reminder, we fully exited this business in Q1 of fiscal year ‘14 and for the full year still expect PUI sales down about a $140 million and about a $0.l0 EPS headwind. Excluding the effect of the PUI’s business exit, operating income was up 3% versus prior year as the positive contribution from new plants overcame higher maintenance cost. Despite the cost and volume impact of the outages, our team executed well. Our maintenance cost is on budget and as we said last quarter, we expect to see a significant reduction in plant maintenance activities in the fourth quarter. We continue to execute on the projects in our backlog and while we may see the typical slight large plant schedule changes, we are seeing our customers successfully start-up their facilities. We talked last quarter about bringing on stream our new world-scale hydrogen plant in St. Charles, Louisiana. Just in time to provide volume to customers as other plants were down for plant maintenance, a great example of the value of world’s largest hydrogen pipeline network.  Now please turn to slide 10, Equipment and Energy segment continues to see strong growth as our leading LNG position had a positive impact on sales and backlog. Sales of a $104 million were up 1% versus prior year while operating income of $70 million was up 9%, higher margin LNG projects and less lower margin ASU activity drove the profit increase. The backlog of $584 million is up significantly, as we announced the PETRONAS second floating LNG project order and received other customer awards that have not yet been announced. The PETRONAS order represents Air Products third LNG order for the developing floating LNG market, great result for our technology and our team. Overall, LNG project development activity remains high.  Now, I will turn the call over to Guillermo for review of our Electronics and Performance Materials segment results.
Guillermo Novo :  Thanks, Steve. Please turn to slide 11, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment delivered another strong quarter as both businesses showed good volume growth and robust leverage to the bottom-line from our cost improvement actions. Segment sales of $618 million, were up 9% versus last year, driven by 9% higher volumes. Versus prior year, electronics sales were up 6% with strength across all segments. Advanced materials showed strong growth as our customers’ ramped production of their next generation nodes driving demand for our materials. Process materials also saw volume growth and moderation of recent pricing pressure. Tonnage grew our new projects on streams and the equipment business was positive versus last year. Sequentially electronics sales were up 2%. Performance materials was up 12% versus last year, as we saw strong growth across all regions and product lines. In fact this was a record volume quarter for the PMD business as we benefited from improved global economic demand, share gains and successful new product introductions. Sequentially sales were up 7%, higher than the typical seasonal improvement. Operating income of a $107 million was up 23% and operating margin was up 200 basis points to 17.3% as leverage from higher volumes was expanded with cost performance. We remain on track in our delivering, on our business restructuring and cost reduction programs. Sequential operating income was flat and margins were down 80 basis points compared to very strong Q2. Now, I will turn the call back over to Seifi.
Seifi Ghasemi:  Thank you, Guill. Now please turn to slide number 12. Our guidance for the fourth quarter is for earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.65. We do appreciate that this represents the significant increase from the third quarter and you can see it will be the highest quarterly earnings that this company has ever delivered. But this is what we have already promised to our shareholders during the last call and we will do our best to deliver what we have committed to. We have been pull all the operating levers under our control to deliver these results.  With respect to capital expenditure, we estimate about $2 billion for the fiscal year. I think it’s also appropriate to make a comment on our energy from waste project in Tees Valley, in the United Kingdom. We planned to begin commissioning the first project late in first fiscal quarter of 2015 and currently expect commission operation late in second fiscal quarter of 2015. I should also add that I’m fully aware that all of you want to know when we will communicate more about our strategy going forward. We just do this and give you an update in less than two months in mid September and by early calendar of 2015, we will have an investor conference when you will meet our team and we will report on the progress we have made in implementing our strategy. But today, I want to touch on another part of our effort to move that products forward that is our company culture. Please turn to a slide number 13. Our company culture is an important and essential part of implementing our strategy. I want to assess the words Air Products culture. We are a global company operating in more than 50 countries. Our people in these countries have their own unique cultures and we fully respect all of those diverse cultures. What I’m defining to in this slide is the Air Product culture that is the principals that we will follow when we are at work at Air Products. We will relentlessly focus to achieve outstanding and world class safety performance. Our goal is nothing less than zero accidents and incidents. We will work very hard to simplify our organization and we will focus everyday to simplifying our work processes so that our organization will move forward. I am very focused on this issue of simplified organization and simplified work processes because I think that is the key to improving our productivity. We will perform our job in the sense of urgency, we believe that the speed of execution is a competitive advantage. And finally, we will act with self confidence, believing that we can set high goals for ourselves and have the ability to achieve them. A positive can do attitude and culture at Air Products is a key element of success as we move forward.  Now we will all be delighted to answer your questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley:  Thank you and good morning, everyone. Seifi, I respect that you are not ready to talk about the go-forward yet. I am just wondering if you can kind of give us an overview of your macro view of the world. I am particularly interested in how you think about growth going forward in Europe and China both from a high level and then maybe from an industrial activity perspective.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, first of all good morning. I will be happy to do that Vincent but I will make a few comments and then I will ask it to turn it over to Scott, to give you a more detailed view of this but overall we see into economic activity in the United States. Overall Europe is kind of a stable and we do see significant improvements in certain parts of Asia, but as I said I will like Scott to make more detailed comments on that.
Scott Crocco:  Hi Vincent, good morning. So, our view of the economy here for fiscal ’14 is very much in line with what our expectations were when we entered the fiscal year. So, just to remind you we will talk about in terms of manufacturing output for fiscal ’14 we had projected manufacturing output to be up year-on-year from 2 to 4% and again we are expecting this is the year coming like that. In U.S. we also expect to see 2% to 4% year-on-year growth. In Europe 0 to 2% so the lowest area of growth recognizing it’s also coming out of the recession the latest of all the different regions. In Asia, we have the projection of 5% to 7% manufacturing output growth year on year principally driven by China. And then in Latin America for the one area we had a range at beginning of the year of 1% to 3% year on year growth frankly that’s the one are that’s coming in at the low end of the range and perhaps below the low end of the range. But again overall we’re seeing the economy in terms of manufacturing output play out larger like we expected when we began the fiscal year.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Okay, just as a follow-up, in Electronics, the equipment trends that were very strong in the prior quarter appear to have continued this quarter and my sense was that that was going to slow down. Has something changed and will this continue going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: I’ll have Guillermo answer that please.
Guillermo Novo: Good morning. The equipment orders are strong. We expect them to continue to remain strong through this year early part of next year and then start tapering down towards the backend of next year.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you very much I’ll pass it on.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And good luck to you Seifi in your new role.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you, John.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: So I guess a couple questions. With regard to your big focus on cash flow and cash generation, can you walk us through at least the types of metrics you think are important in terms of how we would be judging free cash generation for an industrial gas company? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think that the key area of focus is to make sure that you do projects that do generate cash that means that we will take a look at our hurdle rates to make sure that we have the kind of hurdles rates that then when these project come on stream they do generate the kind of cash that we would want to have. Are you referring to the absolute number John or just the relative number?
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Yes, if you’ve got a specific say target for say a best in class that’s more along the lines of what I was getting at.
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, it might be a little bit too soon for me to give you a target John. But we do hope that we will generate a lot more cash than depreciation obviously. So that what we want to do is that we want to be free cash positive even after dividend that’s for sure I’ll go.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, I know it is a little bit early in the process, but it sounds like you have had an opportunity to meet with a lot of the people at Air Products and I am sure review the business at least to some degree. So I guess I'm wondering at least at your first blush would you say there are any major issues with regard to the long-term contracts that may not be fixable quickly or would you say some of the operational difficulties for Air Products over the past and maybe the underperformance is more of an operational focus that is something that could be fixed?
Seifi Ghasemi: John I do not see any significant problems that cannot be addressed and cannot be fixed. Our job over here is not to find excuses and complain about the past our job is here to move forward and deliver results. And whatever issue is there, there might be Air Products is a great company, great people and we will be able to address them and solve them. I am very positive and very excited about being here. We have a lot of projects we have a lot of exciting things to do some of them more difficult than others. But that’s what makes life exciting and that’s what makes discovery exciting, and my team over here is very energized. We will climb many mountains. We need to climb up in order to create value for shareholders John.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Great, thanks very much Seifi and good luck again.
Operator: We’ll now move to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Yes, good morning. Seifi, just following along on your point too of kind of elements of success around the capital allocation, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about your higher return standards going forward, maybe as they would be used as a lens to look at some of the stuff that investors have argued back and forth in the history -- so coal gasification on-site in China, Tees Valley in the UK, the Indura acquisition and then kind of build it and they will come liquid capacity historically. As you look back at those capital decisions, can you walk through how you think those would fare in a new going-forward Air Products?
Seifi Ghasemi: Duffy first of all good morning. My job here is not to second guess anything the company has done. Right now as the CEO of the company I own everything whatever it is it’s Air Products and my job is to look forward not backward. The one thing that I can tell you is that we will look very carefully at every investment and make sure that the returns are risk adjusted based on the circumstances. Obviously if you are doing a project in the U.S. versus we are doing a project somewhere else the risk elements are different. So I do not want to give you a target because then that’s all competitive advantage I don’t want to announce our targets and our strategy on a public call. But the one thing that I can assure you is that we will be looking at all of these targets very carefully and I made the general comment that we will raise our hurdle rates, yes.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays.: Okay. And then you also made the comment that, as you talked to folks throughout the organization, they were ready for change. As an employee, what kind of change should I expect to see over the next year? Is it getting leaner, do we have major cost reductions we need to go through? Is it hustling more to go out and get new business? What kind of changes do you want to drive in the organizational look of Air Products going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think I’ve tried to address that in my last slide which was fundamentally creating a culture which is focused on delivering results. We are not running a country club here we are running a company. And everybody needs to contribute and pull their own weight that is the key issue. And I think people are ready for that, they understand that. And with respect to I delineated for you the focus on safety fortunately that already exist at Air Products and I am very happy about that, simplifying our organization, decentralizing our organization and a sense of urgency to get things done.  And I think as I said at the beginning, I have met with a lot of people. I am very encouraged about what I have seen. There is a very positive attitude and there is a great deal of pride in this company and people are going to rise up to the occasion and deliver and become the best gas company in the world.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays.: Great, thank you very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator: From Citi we’ll now take P.J. Juvekar.
P.J. Juvekar - Citibank: Thank you. Seifi welcome to Air Products.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much.
P.J. Juvekar - Citibank: Air Products has spent about $4.5 billion in CapEx in the last three years, but that hasn't really shown up in earnings. So what is your understanding so far why we haven't seen that impact yet?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, on that front the general comment that I had is that a lot of those CapEx has been spent on long term projects. I mean you need to judge us on the performance of these projects over the next 15 years better than on the first year that had comes in operation. Projects get delayed so the customer is delayed and all of that. So, I don’t think there is anything basically wrong with these projects and in time we will see the returns. Our job is that while these projects are coming on stream is to significantly improve our existing operations so that you see that at a better returns and better performance on a short term basis while these projects kind of get on line in the future and deliver the results. So, improving the short term results is something that we need to do that comes from improving productivity, increasing prices and all of the other things that one needs to do.
P.J. Juvekar - Citibank: Thank you. You have a plan of a decentralized model. Do you believe Air Products is too centralized and do you think decisions like pricing should be made locally? Thank you. 
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. Do I think that Air Products is too centralized, yes I do. I think we should decentralize a little bit more. Yes. Okay?
P.J. Juvekar - Citibank: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Sure.
Operator: We’ll now move to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan : Hi. You spoke about price competition in the merchant markets in China. When you look at your larger capital projects, your larger on-site projects in China over a multiyear period, do you now expect somewhat lower expected returns on capital because various piggyback efforts would be diminished by the price competition, which was probably unforeseen at the time that the projects were designed or is it independent?
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, that’s obviously very good question. I think Corning can answer that. Corning, please?
Corning Painter: Yes, thanks for the question. I think it’s fairly straight forward. So if the pricing comes in to be below what we had expected. Yes, it’s going to impact the return, maybe just give a little color on the China situation. So pricing right now I think has impacted impart by just real retail or wholesale price moving but also as we and others have brought on capacity very typical in the early years to low that with wholesale. And so as we get through the slug of capacity I think then there is a chance to move more and more to retail using our application skills to sell direct. And so I think we can look forward to some improvement from where we are today. And I think you can expect projects that are closer to the coast, let’s say the south of Shanghai, Pearl River Delta we’ll see that more rapidly I think in the north it trends a lot uncovering policy around the steel industry and it just take a little bit longer as we move further west. 
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay. And then for my follow-up, in the tonnage discussion, you spoke about hydrogen demand in the Gulf Coast being relatively strong, but volume for the quarter was only up 2%. So what is the magnitude of the hydrogen growth and what are the specific factors or what is contracting that is diminishing the overall level of volume growth? 
Seifi Ghasemi: Jeff, another good question, I think Steve will be able to answer that. We were discussing that this morning. Steve?
Steve Jones: Sure. I guess Jeff if you look at the Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes over the last seven quarters this quarter was the highest by a fairly large margin, so good hydrogen volumes in the Gulf Coast. What kind of comes out on the other side of that was to cover balances is the outages. So, if you look at the 2% volume growth. The strong volumes from U.S. Gulf Coast and a new project impacts are offset by the outages, right. So, the outages tend to have an impact on that and particularly it’s around, so I have talked to a lot of you over the years about we have base facility charges, they are generally paid during the outages but we also on a pipeline system, we have customers and we also customers who pay, have a minimum take or pay volume. That take or pay volume is over a 12 month period, so when we have an outage they won’t necessarily take volumes and they will make that up over the next 12 months, so you do have a volume impact that occurs when you have maintenance outages.
Unidentified Company Representative :  Jeff, if I may I think when it gets to the second quarter and third quarter of fiscal year next year, I think you will be able to see good improvement in the volumes which would validate the point because we can give you the outages by then.
Operator:  We will now move to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Very good, thank you. Seifi, there is a very well-documented margin gap between yourself and your US peer. How much of that gap is gettable, do you think, and in what timeframe? And even if you can't quantify it, maybe qualify your answer in that sense.
Seifi Ghasemi:  David, can you wait another two months, so that I can address this thing in mid-September.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: I will wait.
Seifi Ghasemi:  Yes, I appreciate that and then the other thing is that we always like to be number one not number two but we will address that for you in mid-September, okay?
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And may be just one more thing on first blush, does this entire portfolio to you make sense i.e. from the non-gas businesses, do they make sense to you longer term in this portfolio?
Scott Crocco:  Well, I believe that the entire portfolio of Air Products right now has room for improvement therefore we are going to take a look at that and right now push for improvement rather than saying we want to get rid of this part or that part. Once we have improved the rating then we have options to take a look at. So, I just want to say nothing is for sale right now, we are all focused on improving the performance of all of our businesses and there is room for improvement in all of our businesses.
Operator: From SunTrust we will now take James Sheehan.
James Sheehan - SunTrust :  Thanks. A question for Scott. On the second-half outlook being a little bit more muted than you thought a quarter ago, is all of that in base business improvement or are there other factors that are in play here?
Scott Crocco :  So, the top end of the range that we brought down was really driven more by the on streams from the new plants and it’s just timing. It’s difficult to predict exactly which plants are going to come up when, so the second half of the year as we have mentioned has got about two-thirds of the items are specifics and one-third for base improvement and there is no change to that. And so we are focused as Seifi mentioned on pulling all the leverage that we have at our disposal in order to deliver on the year.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Thank you. And then a question for Seifi. In terms of the way this business is organized, we've looked at the merchant business and having margins in that business potentially in the high teens when it's running at a steady state. Do you still see that as an achievable objective or do you look at the Company in a different way given your cash flow focus?
Seifi Ghasemi :  I believe that we have room for improvement and I like to turn to the gentleman who is going to deliver that for me and that’s Corning, so Corning?
Corning Painter:  So, I think we have no question in anybody’s mind in a merchant business that we can improve significantly from where our returns are now and get back to where we have historically been, I think in terms of timing and so forth I don’t want to steal Seifi’s funda for what we might say in September but absolutely positively the ability to improve this.
Operator:  And from Goldman Sachs we will now take Bob Koort.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Seifi, congrats on your move. Clearly, the market is excited. I think since the day you were announced, there has been a $3 billion market cap increase and -- you now trade at a 10% premium to all your industrial gas peers, so clearly the markets are embracing it. I'm curious, as you did your due diligence, you talked about the Company culture and what you are looking for in simplicity, speed and self-confidence. I'm assuming your view is there is quite a gap between where you want to be and where you are today. I am wondering if you could speak just a little bit about that. Or maybe what has caused that historically and how you can remove the impediments to being better in those regards.
Seifi Ghasemi :  Bob as usual you like to ask very difficult questions, right. I think that the best way for me to describe it is that we do have a lot of good people here who remember the past when they were the best in the industry and they want to get back to that. I think the key impediments to the organization in the past have been simplicity of the organization and the sense of urgency and the speed in making things happen. And the other thing is I think is the issue of empowerment. I mean your chance on it company the size of Air Products by having 1% responsible for P&L, you need to empower people to make decisions all the way down the line. So, if I wanted to kind of summarize it I think simplicity, the speed of execution and empowerment has been some of the issues that we will address and I think that would create a lot of, it has created a lot of excitement. I have spend a lot of time with our people as I said, I’ve talked to more than a thousand people here and I intend to cover all the 1,000 people but people are very excited about everything, I am not facing a resistance of pushing against the closed door. This is very exciting for me quite answering.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs:  So, Seifi, would it be fair to say you see it, and I agree with you. I mean if we went back to the 1980s and 1990s, you are right, Air Products was always considered sort of the premium in the industry. Is it just a function of we've had a couple decades of accumulated cultural headwind and so you think most of the change that is required is more around culture and less around assets? Is that fair?
Seifi Ghasemi:  I think as we go forward Bob, in my presentation you see what I said focusing on, I was focusing on the company culture and I think that is a significant opportunity for us then in addition to that we also need to look at the project as we go forward in terms of the returns and also in terms of the structure, our geographic focus, industrial gases is a local business, what is important is your strength in Southern Ohio, not your market share in all of the United States. So, we will focus on all of that but yes I do believe that the culture change is a big opportunity, yes.
Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs:  Terrific. Best of luck, Seifi. 
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you very much. Looking forward to seeing you soon Bob.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Good morning. Congratulations to you, Seifi. Given your increased focus on cash flow and your employment of higher hurdle rates in the future, can you comment, Seifi, on the shape of the project backlog and how much that might decline and how much your capital expenditures might come down in future years?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, good morning Kevin, first of all. I think that first of all what is I review is not going to add an effect in our backlog because the backlog is what we have committed and we are going to execute. In terms of what we will do in the future, it obviously depends on the opportunity but it also depends on the cash generation. One way to focus on cash generation is to cut expenditure and other one is to increase cash generation. So, we are going to focus to increase our cash generation by being more productive and doing a lot of the right things that one needs to do and getting more out of what we have but in terms of what the shape of the future will be, it will depend on opportunities, it will depend on our ability to generate the cash that we need and then we will see how it works out, I don’t see a significant drop off because we want to participate in the growth in the industry but we will obviously be a lot more careful about some of the things that we do.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And then second, I wanted to follow up on an earlier question. I heard your comment that you don't have any businesses for sale today. But are you generally happy with the composition of the portfolio or over the next several quarters, should we expect you to evaluate businesses in order to determine whether certain businesses may be core or noncore? Will you be engaged in that way or not?
Seifi Ghasemi: Kevin, my job is to constantly review our portfolio and see what can be done to maximize shareholder value. I’m sure you heard me say that I’m not enamored with size. Size doesn’t matter, what matters is the value of our stock. So, you should expect us to constantly review our portfolio and decide what is the best course of action to create value for our shareholder, I don’t want to pre-judge that, I do want to say that from what I see, all of our businesses have room for improvement. So, it would be kind of premature to take any action before you get these businesses performing to the best of their ability.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks very much.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Operator:  We will now move to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc:  Hey, good morning guys and congrats to you Seifi for coming to Air Products.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Can you maybe comment on what you see is the growth opportunities in the industrial gas industry, do you think that Air Products is positioned well to participate in the growth over the next two years as you change the culture?
Seifi Ghasemi: I think Air Products is very well positioned for participating in the future because we do have the fundamental technologies that are required, I mean the future in the industrial gases in terms of growth is going to be in the areas of energy environment and all of that products extremely well-positioned in not only large ASUs but the smaller ASUs, mid-sized ASUs. We are world leaders in hydrogen and micro applications. So there is opportunity I do not see Air Products having a technology gap to prevent us from participating on those growth areas.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, when you think about decentralizing the business and maybe the way you organize your segments, is the right way to manage an industrial gas business -- is it by segment like you have it now or is it by region? Any major changes in the way your operating management will be set up?
Seifi Ghasemi: Can I answer that question for even in middle of September so that I don’t get it ahead on myself?
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Absolutely.
Seifi Ghasemi: I would appreciate that. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies: Good morning. Two quick ones just at the end. First, do you have a metric for how much outages have been a drag to cash flow or EBITDA over the last three years? And secondly, in the past, there has been a tension between the Air Products long-term growth and [Indiscernible] focus and the stock market's relatively short horizon sometimes. And as you are looking at the realignment of the business, are you willing to invest in things near term because you see the cash flows three, four, five years out or are you committing to sort of a floor, so to speak, in terms of choppiness around cash flow in the near term as well?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I like to Simon to make a comment on that. But before that let me just say we are running Air Products for the long term, and this is not something that we are going to do to make ourselves look good in one year and then damage the company in the second year. I mean Air Products is going to be here for another 200 years and we are going to run the company properly for the long term, so just wanted to make that comment. But I’d like Simon to make a comment on the other two issues that you raised and also Scott if you want to. Simon?
Simon Moore: Laurence, just a couple of quick numbers, so as you know, we said this year we’d expect to manage cost we are at 2% headwind versus prior year. Fundamentally on average our total maintenance cost for the company is about $250 million a year of expense audit fees to so it’s also a capital component as well. So hopefully that frames it and we can follow up later on if you’d like.
Seifi Ghasemi: Okay, thanks Laurence.
Operator: From Susquehanna Financial we’ll take Don Carson.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Yes, hi, Seifi. Two questions, one on the capital structure side. Traditionally industrial gas companies have been pretty conservative on wanting to maintain an investment-grade rating. Are you willing to lever the Company up more to perhaps return cash to the shareholders a little quicker than you might get from an operational improvement in cash flow? And then, secondly, as you look at your North American position, do you think you are disadvantaged by not having a cylinder gas position to take advantage of this long forecast manufacturing renaissance?
Seifi Ghasemi: First of all, good morning, Don. Last time you asked me a question about industrial gases it was about 20 years ago but anyway good to talk to you again. I am, first of all we do value our investment grade rating and we would want to maintain that unless a phenomenal opportunity comes about but I don’t foresee that right now. So, maintaining investment grade is important to us. As far as the lack of the so called package gases business in the United States, I don’t consider it a significant disadvantage it’s something that is nice to have but is not a must have. If we can create that at a reasonable cost and a reasonable price that would be something that we will look at. But I do not consider that to be a significant competitive disadvantage we can compete the way we are.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Thank you.
Seifi Ghasemi: Thank you. We have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question will come from Mark Gulley with BGC.
Mark Gulley - BGC Partners: Yes. Return on capital was not mentioned either in your slide 4 or your later slide about the Ses. Can you comment on the fact that Air Products has been below double-digit ROC and how you might see that metric going forward?
Seifi Ghasemi: Well, I think that our ROC is going to kind of not improve very quickly in the short term because we have a lot of CapEx that is being spent that is not currently generating revenue. So I would see that being going down but our goal is to increase the return on capital to what I think the industry is capable of delivering which is to up to 13%, that is obviously will be our goal. But I think in the short term I mean you know this Mark in short term we will while these projects are being built you obviously have depreciation without much profit against it.
Mark Gulley - BGC Partners: And then if I dispose with an observation I welcome as well as others do the fact you are showing EBITDA for the company. You may want to show EBITDA for each segment as well so we track back to.
Seifi Ghasemi: We will, we will show EBITDA for the segment, for the business unit. EBITDA will be what we will guide us in terms of not only measuring performance but also for our reward system that we will be very focused on that market. And thank you for your remark, I appreciate that.
Scott Crocco:  Okay, thank you very much everybody. We do appreciate your participation in the call and we look forward to seeing many of you as we go on the road on next call. Thanks again and have a great day.
Operator:  Once again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Air Products and Chemicals’ Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) This telephone conference, presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products and all rights are reserved. Air Products will be recording this teleconference and may publish all or a portion of the teleconference. No other recording or redistribution of this telephone conference by any other party, are permitted without the expressed written permission of Air Products. Your participation indicates your agreement. Beginning today’s call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon Moore - Director, Investor Relations: Thank you, Derrick. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products’ second quarter 2014 results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I am pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO. John will make a few opening remarks, Scott will review our results and update our outlook, and I will provide perspective on each of our operating segments. After our remarks, we will be pleased to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. We issued our earnings release this morning. It’s available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today’s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on this slide, and at the end of today’s earnings release, the explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now, I will turn the call over to John.
John McGlade - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Simon. And let me also wish everyone a good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Please turn to Slide #3. Bottom line is we continued to deliver on our commitments during the second quarter. Earnings are within our guidance range despite a $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact from adverse weather in the United States and Canada, which to be clear we expect to recover the effects of in Q3 and Q4. We are executing on the projects in our backlog. We brought on-stream two major projects in our pipeline networks. One is the new hydrogen plant, Louisiana, supporting the world’s largest hydrogen system in the United States Gulf Coast and the second is the new nitrogen plant in the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan supporting some of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. We are driving asset loadings with strong volume growth in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials. We continue to deliver on our cost reduction programs. We were on track and seeing the savings from the program we announced last year and we raised the dividend by 8.5% making this the 32nd year of consecutive increases. However, we can do more. We need to continue to improve our productivity and the results from higher asset loadings and we are aggressively managing price and cost. Your products management team remains committed to driving increasing shareholder value. The investments we have made over the past several years, the strength and position of our portfolio and our ability to execute going forward will drive a very positive future for Air Products. I also realized many of you are interested in an update on the progress of the search for a new CEO. As I shared with you previously, the Board is working with an executive search firm to find the right high-quality candidate who has the skills and expertise to take our company forward. While I am purposely not involved in that process, I know that there has been significant productive activity and I remain confident that we will find the right leader for Air Products within the expected timeframe we previously shared. Now, let me turn the call over to Scott to review our results.
Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 4, let me now take you through our fiscal Q2 results. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 4% above prior year on higher energy pass-through and stronger volumes, primarily in our Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Underlying sales were up 2% excluding the polyurethane intermediates or PUI business. As we have mentioned previously, a significant number of our tonnage gases customers had scheduled outages this quarter impacting our volumes. Sequentially, overall sales increased 1% on higher energy pass-through. Underlying volumes were 1% lower primarily due to the impact from Lunar New Year, which more than offset the seasonal upturn in our Performance Materials business. Operating income of $385 million decreased 1% versus prior year as strong results in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment and Energy segments were more than offset by lower Merchant and Tonnage gases results. Tonnage was impacted by the customer outages I just mentioned and Merchant was affected by the unusually harsh U.S., Canada weather which impacted power costs and our operations. As John said we expect to recover the weather related costs over the next two quarters. Our operating margin of 14.9% declined 80 basis points versus prior year as the positive contribution from higher volumes was offset by the higher costs and the dilutive effect of higher energy cost pass through. Net income and diluted earnings per share were 2% and 4% lower respectively versus last year. Our return on capital employed declined 120 basis points to 9.7% as a result of higher capital employed, lower earnings and the Indura acquisition. This remains well above our 8% cost of capital. I want to remind you that the new projects we are developing, executing and operating will be accretive to ROC over the next few years. Turning to Slide 5, you can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter’s performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.32, decreased by $0.05 versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.12 driven by the strong performance in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment and Energy segments. Volumes were also higher in Merchant Gases. Pricing energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.07 due primarily the higher variable cost in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials including the impact of weather on power costs. Net cost performance was $0.04 unfavorable as higher costs primarily due to the planned Tonnage maintenance outages and inflation offset the benefit of our 2012 and 2013 cost reduction programs. The impact of the PUI business exit was about $0.03. Equity affiliate income was down about $0.03 due mainly to weaker emerging market currencies and some one-time items. In general the underlying business performance remained solid and we expect equity affiliate income to rebound next quarter. Lower interest expense contributed $0.01, a slightly lower tax rate and non-controlling interest together contributed $0.01. For FY ‘14 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, unchanged from last year. And finally higher shares outstanding reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Now for a review of our business segment results, I will turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Moore - Director, Investor Relations: Thanks Scott. Please turn to Slide 6, overall the Merchant Gases segment had a challenging quarter that included the negative effect of the adverse winter weather in U.S., Canada. However, we see this as a timing issue and expect to fully recover those lost profits in Q3 and Q4. We have a robust set of actions in place that we are confident will drive improvement in this business. Merchant Gases sales of over a $1 billion were up 4% versus last year on 4% higher volumes. All regions showed positive liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes, but this was partially offset by lower helium volumes globally due to supply challenges and continued packaged gas demand weakness in Europe. Sales and volumes were down 1% sequentially due to economic weakness in South America and the Lunar New Year slowdown in Asia. With regard to helium we continued to see challenges from reduced feedstock availability particularly driven by low LNG production levels in Algeria and the continuing decline in crude deliveries from the U.S. government. Our new helium plant in Wyoming has produced some product during a short period of acceptable feed gas supply. We expect to ramp production and begin exporting product this quarter as our supplier lines out their gas processing plant. We are just beginning to see an increase in crude from one of our existing U.S. suppliers as a result of working with them to expand their natural gas pipeline collection system. And our Colorado facility is on schedule for FY ’15. We expect this additional supply to roughly offset the declines from the U.S. government over the next year or so. Merchant Gases’ operating income of $143 million was down 15% versus prior year and sequentially. Segment operating margin of 13.8% was down 300 basis points compared to last year and down 230 basis points sequentially. There were a number of factors that negatively impacted profits despite volumes being up. To be clear, additional volume that improves loading on our existing facilities has in general been consistent with the 30% to 40% incremental operating margins we have shared with you in the past. While we are pleased with our EPCO CO2 acquisition and this is a profitable business in the first year, no new investment would show incremental margins versus the prior year. Going forward, loading of existing EPCO assets will provide similar incremental margins as the rest of our liquid bulk business. And in China, the pricing dynamic, new capacity, the economy and the wholesale market limit incremental profit growth. We took actions to recover the U.S./Canada weather-related costs in Q2 and expect to fully recover the net $0.03 to $0.04 impact by the end of the year. In addition to this weather impact, we continue to see price versus variable cost challenges and we did see fixed cost inflation. And finally, last year, we shared that we had a $0.02 positive impact from an asset sale. Now, let me share a few examples of specific actions we are taking to drive improvement in the business. The team is driving China liquid and Europe packaged gas volume improvements in part through enhanced sales incentive programs. We are focused on delivering productivity benefits, including product swaps, power management, distribution optimization and efficiently upgrading and replacing older plants, and of course, recovering the U.S./Canada weather impact through pricing. We are confident these programs will improve profitability going forward. Now, let’s take a look at the Merchant business by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In U.S./Canada, sales were up 11% on 6% higher volumes and 5% higher pricing. Despite the difficult weather conditions, liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen volumes were up 4% on oilfield services, food and metals market strength. We saw a positive volume contribution from the EPCO acquisition, but helium volumes were down due to supply limitations. Capacity utilization remains in the upper 70s. Both helium and LOX/LIN pricing were positive and we will continue to work hard to recover the Q2 weather impact. In Europe, sales were up 2% versus last year due to currency as both volumes and prices were down 1%. LOX/LIN and LAR volumes were positive, but were offset by lower helium and cylinder volumes. LOX/LIN volume growth was strong in Central, Northern and Southern Europe, with the food, metals and medical markets showing strength. Construction remains weak and cylinder volumes were down across the continent. Overall, pricing was down slightly as positive helium pricing did not fully offset negative liquid products and cylinder pricing. And LOX/LIN plant loadings remain in the high 70s. In Asia, sales were up 6% versus last year on 6% higher volumes. LOX/LIN volumes were again up double-digits across the whole region and in China all helium was down on supply limitations. Plant loadings remain in the mid 70s with capacity additions roughly matching the volume increase. Pricing was down in the LOX/LIN and LAR business, particularly in China driven in part by the wholesale market. Lower prices and higher variable cost impacted margins. Helium pricing was up. Let me provide a little more insight into the China market, where the liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon business has a slightly different dynamic. First, as manufacturing growth and resultant Merchant demand growth over the last few years has been below expectations, there is capacity available across the industry. We expect China’s strong underlying manufacturing growth to absorb this capacity, but it will likely take a few years. In 2014, the market is still absorbing new capacity additions from project decisions made a few years ago, but we have not approved any new merchant capacity in China in the last 18 months. Second, China has a wholesale market structure that doesn’t exist to the same degree in other regions. Although the outsourcing or onsite model is increasingly popular, traditionally large volume customers would buy and operate their own plants. In the case of steel mills, many also have their own liquid capacity. When the steel mill is running hard, they use all their own capacity and sometimes buy additional product from the market. When steel demand is weaker and the mills are not running as hard, they often export product into the wholesale market. Where we have capacity to sell, we are using the wholesale market as an outlet for product even at lower prices as the wholesale market doesn’t walk in the lower prices for a long period of time. As a result of the combination of available capacity in the larger wholesale market, we are likely to continue to see volume and price dynamics in China. We continue to see incremental margins in the context of additional load on existing facilities in the range of 30% to 40%. However, new capacity additions aren’t incremental and combined with the price pressure will prevent us from seeing those incremental margins in China in the near-term. We are taking actions in a number of areas to manage the situation. In terms of demand creation, while our volumes are impacted by manufacturing activity, we also have the ability to use our applications expertise to help our customers improve their operations or creating new demand for industrial gases. In February, we announced we have signed more than 20 contracts with recycled copper manufacturers in China providing oxygen, our patented burner, and fully integrated control equipment. Compared to the previous air fuel solution using oxygen, it improves productivity and material qualities or reducing emissions and fuel consumption. We are also optimizing capacity in regions where it makes sense. While we are reviewing each point in our system, we would not expect this to result in a significant impact. Turning to Latin America, as a reminder, the segment results include our wholly-owned business in Brazil and our majority-owned business Indura. While our market leading equity affiliate joint venture in Mexico is not in the segment results, our Mexico business continues to show volume growth driven primarily by nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery. As reported in the segment, underlying sales were up 5% on 3% higher volumes and 2% higher prices. There was a negative 14% impact from currency, primarily from the Chilean peso. Indura volumes and Brazil LOX/LIN volumes were up slightly as the region experienced slower economic growth than expected. LOX/LIN plant capacity utilization remains in the mid 70s and pricing was up, but still under recovered inflation. Please turn to Slide 8. As expected, Tonnage Gases saw both the maintenance expense and negative volume impact from the higher level of planned outages as we do required maintenance work on our plans during our customers’ outages. Base demand, including hydrogen on the U.S. Gulf Coast system, remains strong. Tonnage Gases sales of $840 million were up 4% versus last year. Gases volumes were down 3% as strong demand on the U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen system continued, but was more than offset by maintenance outages and lower Latin America volumes due to our prior year contract termination. Lower PUI volumes impacted sales by 5% while higher energy pass-through added 11%. We fully exited the PUI business at the end of Q1, but still se the effect in prior year comparisons, about $40 million of sales and about $0.03 of profits. For the full year, we still expect PUI sales down about $140 million and about a $0.10 EPS headwind. Excluding the effect of the PUI business exit, operating income was down 3% versus prior year primarily due to the impact of the planned maintenance outages partially offset by the positive impact from higher natural gas prices. We saw about $0.05 for maintenance costs and expect to continue to see an elevated level of maintenance activity in Q3 associated with non-refinery customers on the U.S. Gulf Coast and a few outages outside the U.S. Air Products continues to profitably grow the world’s largest hydrogen plant pipeline network in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We have recently brought on-stream our new world-scale hydrogen plant in St. Charles, Louisiana in part to support Valero’s St. Charles refinery. And just last week, we announced the long-term agreement to utilize the hydrogen rich off gas from enterprise in Mont Belvieu, Texas to provide additional capacity for our pipeline customers. A recent Gulf Coast refinery contract expansion with increased hydrogen supply of potentially up to 50 million standard cubic feet a day is an example of continued demand growth from our customers. Both of these facilities will be fully integrated with our hydrogen plant and pipeline network. Please turn to Slide 9. The Electronics and Performance Materials segment delivered very strong performance this quarter with both businesses showing volume growth and robust leverage to the bottom line from our cost improvement actions. Segment sales of $592 million were up 8% versus last year driven by 9% higher volumes and 1% lower price. Versus prior year Electronic sales were up 6% primarily driven by higher delivery systems equipment sales. Sales growth in advanced materials was offset by the impact of product exit through improvement actions in Process Materials. The strength of our delivery systems business reflects our leadership positions with key customers. However, given the lack of new fab projects currently being developed, we expect activity to normalize to more historical levels later this year. Sequentially, Electronics sales were down 3% on the expected Asia seasonality. Performance Materials sales were up 10% versus last year as we saw double digit growth from stronger demand and share gains across most product lines and growth in all major regions. Autos, protective and specialty coatings and oilfield continued to be strong. Sequentially, sales were up 9%, in line with stronger demand and expected seasonal improvements. Operating income of $107 million was up 38% and operating margin was up 400 basis points to 18.1% as leverage from the higher volumes was expanded with strong cost performance. We remain on track and are delivering on our business restructuring and cost reduction programs. Pricing was relatively stable across both businesses reflecting a strengthening in the electronics materials market. Complementing our previously announced bulk gas supply to Samsung in Xi'an, China, we announced the contract award for bulk specialty gas and chemical delivery systems equipment at the same location to support Samsung Electronics’ largest ever overseas investment. We also brought on stream the first phase of our expansion in the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan, home to a number of world scale semiconductor manufacturing facilities. We have been successfully supporting key customers in this science park for over 15 years. Now please turn to Slide 10, the Equipment and Energy segment had another strong quarter as our LNG leadership position continues to drive profit growth. Sales of $110 million were down 11% versus prior year, while operating income of $23 million was up 11%. More higher margin LNG projects and less lower margin ASU activity drove the profit increase. The backlog of $338 million is relatively stable. In general, we continue to see a high level of project development activity with a number of awards signed, but not yet announced. Now, I will turn the call back over to Scott.
Scott Crocco - Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Simon. Now, please turn to Slide 11 and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Economic activity in the second quarter of 2014 was in line with our expectations in most regions. Given current economic conditions, we continued to expect modest economic growth in the second half of fiscal 2014. Globally, for the regions we operate in we are maintaining a manufacturing growth forecast of 2% to 4% for our fiscal year. In the U.S. some policy uncertainty has been reduced, but harsh winter weather conditions restricted manufacturing growth in January and February. We expect the slowdown to be temporary. Although still weak, conditions in Europe have been improving. Austerity programs, restricted credit and high unemployment remain the largest obstacles to the European recovery. We expect stronger manufacturing growth for Asia in FY ‘14, despite a slight deceleration in China. Improving manufacturing conditions in Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan are driving stronger growth in Asia. And in South America, manufacturing activity continues to be below expectations. The easing of demand for global commodities, particularly from China has adversely impacted countries including Chile. We expect the electronics market will grow in 2014, but likely at a slower rate than anticipated. We continued to expect FY ‘14 capital spending to be approximately $2 billion and our backlog at the end of the quarter remained at about $3.5 billion. You can see an updated list of our major projects in the appendix; Slide 14. Based on our current outlook for the year, our FY ‘14 EPS guidance range is now $5.70 to $5.85 per share for the year. Our guidance for Q3 is for earnings per share of $1.42 to a $1.47 based on the following positive factors: the absence of the Q2 weather impact and the recovery of a portion of that in the Merchant business, volume improvements across the businesses, including new plant on-streams, higher equity affiliate results and further progress on our cost reduction initiatives. Now, let me turn the call back over to John to wrap up.
John McGlade - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide #12. In conclusion, I want to assure you that our management team and I remain focused on the strategic priorities we set out at the beginning of this year, executing on our project backlog, driving productivity and cost reduction, winning profitable business in the marketplace and delivering profitable growth from our existing assets. We are confident these actions will generate long-term shareholder value. Thank you. And now we are ready to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citibank.
P.J. Juvekar - Citibank: Yes, thank you. Couple of questions. First of all, can you quantify the weather impact and then if it’s increased cost, etcetera because of weather, how do you plan to recover that in the second half?
Scott Crocco: So, P.J., this is Scott. So again, in the second quarter here, we saw higher costs, particularly in the Northeast and the Midwest driven by power on the order of $0.03 to $0.04 per share. Now, what we have – and we have recovered some of that during the quarter, but going forward, we would expect to have a $0.02 recovery in the third quarter and again a $0.02 recovery in the fourth quarter. So, overall for the year, a $0.03 to $0.04 headwind in the second quarter and tailwinds of $0.02 in both Q3 and Q4.
P.J. Juvekar - Citibank: Okay, thank you. And secondly, can you update us on the six sort of coal to chemicals project that you are working on in China sort of the timing and the returns that you expect especially in light of your cautious comment on the merchant market in China?
John McGlade: So, this is John, P.J. Those projects are tracking with what we originally expected from a return point of view and from a schedule point of view within the context of recognizing that these are very large projects. None of these – well, few of these projects have liquid of any major amount on them. Sometimes there is just a little bit of co-produced liquid, but these were not justified or built on the basis of the merchant business. These were straight up onsite projects that had to earn a return on the onsite return and pricing to the customer and a risk profile of those projects.
P.J. Juvekar - Citibank: Thank you.
Scott Crocco: Thanks, P.J.
John McGlade: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We will take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning.
John McGlade: Good morning.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: I am wondering if you could talk a little bit on the electronics side, your margin starting to look pretty attractive again, where are you in terms of the realization of some of the cost cuts you have done there? And then also could you maybe give some help on the equipment sale, I know those tend to be lumpy. How much was that accretive to the margin during the quarter?
Scott Crocco: Right. So Bob, this is Scott. As you pointed out, we have got a variety of actions underway in electronics both from a volume growth, profitable volume growth as well as restructuring asset and other costs. And those actions are progressing very well. As you also pointed out, there was a bunch of a fair amount of delivery systems that we had in this quarter and while we would expect to continue to see them going forward not at the rate that we saw in the second quarter. So, the electronics team has done a nice job repositioning that portfolio, taking the actions that they had committed to and improving the margins, recognizing I would not expect to see going forward the same level of margins in the second half of the year that we saw in this quarter, but that said continue to see good execution on their part and really turned that business around.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: And I know when you guys addressed some of the capacity reductions for ammonia and NF3 you mentioned lackluster photovoltaic demand trends, but it seems like maybe things are starting to get better there. So, is there any risk that you maybe cut capacity just as things get better or you have sufficient ex-U.S. capacity to meet that demand growth?
Scott Crocco: No. So, just a reminder, so we have gotten out of the silane and so it was small to begin with and so there is not really any impact there from that market.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you, John. Just on Tonnage, it looked like it should be a better second half of the year and a much better 2015 given these new projects coming on stream and a few headwinds for us there, how should we think about that earnings progression Q2 – second half versus first half this year and ‘15 versus ‘14?
John McGlade: Yes, so I will take the top level here and Scott can give you a little bit more details. But I mean I think you hit it spot on. We have been saying for a while that the project backlog as we execute that and bring that into the portfolio is going to drive earnings into ‘15 and ’16. And as you well know, something like 85% of that $3.5 billion backlog is in the Tonnage sector. As we look to the second half of this year, two real key things are happening here. As you are going to forego some of the maintenance – you are going to get beyond the maintenance outages that hit us in Q1, Q2. They will be in Q3, but largely back to a fairly low level in Q4 and then we will begin to see the benefits of some of the new plant start-ups in three and then accelerating in four.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Great. And John just on the CEO search, what’s taking the Board so long, it’s been now seven months since you announced in late September, it shouldn’t be this long, what’s preventing the Board from making decision, it probably can’t be helpful to the organization not knowing who the next lead will be, so why is it taking so long to name a new CEO here?
John McGlade: Well, we could probably debate what long is, but that aside, I mean this Board takes and the search committee take this very, very seriously. And they are really focused on making sure that they get the right candidate in this role. I know that they completely understand their fiduciary responsibilities and the commitments we have made from a timing point of view and they are tracking to that.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Scott Crocco: David, this is Scott. Let me take you back to the first question about the second half of the year. And I would like to broaden it beyond Tonnage. As we look at the first two quarters and what we have delivered and compare that to our outlook for the full year, recognize there is a considerable step-up in the second half versus the first half. We will step back and take a look at what the drivers of those things are. And put about two-thirds of those drivers being specific things beyond just general base business improvement. Let me give you some examples and let me give you some numbers, right. So when you look at the second half versus the first half for the full year for the full company, weather in the second half versus the first half, because we don’t have any more inclement weather projected in the second half and we do have the recovery of those costs that we saw in the second quarter about $0.07 to 0.08 improvement second half versus the first half driven by weather. We continue to execute on the cost reduction actions. Second half versus the first half would be on the order of about $0.05. Maintenance, like we have talked about, is going to decline in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter there will be a reduction, second half maintenance expense versus first half maybe $0.04 or $0.05. And then a considerable step-up from new plants as we bring the projects on stream somewhere in the order of, call it $0.12 to $0.14. And that leaves about a third of the step-up in the second half of the year driven by base business improvement and general increases. So I just want to take you through that and give you some numbers and specifics around the drivers of our outlook.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much. I just want to follow-up on the cost recovery in the second half of the year. You said it’s related to largely related to power, what is the mechanism by which you actually get that back from your customers that such as you couldn’t get it back in the sort of in real time, I am just – it kind of feels like spilled milk to me at this point?
Scott Crocco: Right, so there is various mechanisms, whether that’s in the form of formulas as it works its way through various indices or surcharges or just straight price increases making sure that we are taking the appropriate actions given the current situation with the customer and the supply situation in that region.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just kind of on a follow-up as well to the succession or management issue, there is a fair amount as I am sure you are aware of speculation about what could change at the company when new leadership comes in. So, I am going to assume that, that’s also the case within the company. What if anything, have you been able to do to kind of keep everybody focused and executing on your plan or is it at all a concern for you?
John McGlade: Well, I think it’s not a concern. And in fact, I am a firm believer, when you look at certain external events, whatever they are you really sit down with your leadership team and say look, our job is x and in this case, our job is running this company and delivering on the commitments that we have made to our shareholders at the beginning of this year. And I believe that we are doing that. And to the extent that people aren’t on board with that, then there is another dialog with them. But from my perspective, making sure that there is no lack of clarity and/or accountability around what we need to do, we are not going to influence, they are not going to influence who the new CEO is. That’s the board and the search committee’s responsibility to do that. It’s one of the prerogatives of a board one of their key issues is on succession. And so it can be an interesting dialog, but not one that’s worth spending a lot of time on. And I have been very clear with the broad organization as well as (indiscernible).
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Yes, good morning. Wanted to probe a little bit deeper on your Merchant Gas segment margins, which declined about 300 basis points, I heard quite a few different issues here. I think I scribbled down five different ones. Trying to get a sense of how much of the decline might be attributable to transitory issues, such as the weather that you discussed versus more durable issues? It sounded for example like the China pressure might extend for a while, is there a way to disentangle the margin delta in that sort of simple fashion?
John McGlade: Yes, Kevin, I am going to let Scott give you the details, but I want to just be really clear to you and our other shareholders. I and the management team and the board are not happy with the performance of this segment. And I have been working very closely with Corning Painter who took over this segment in the early part of Q1. And with his leadership team, I think he has a really good set of actions that vary as you acknowledge by the different geographies and business environments that we are operating in. But I don’t want there to be any confusion that this level of margin performance in this business is not acceptable and that we are absolutely committed to getting the margins in this business back on track to where they ought to be and where they have been in the past. Scott could give you a little bit more granularity around the specifics to your question but I wanted to really reinforce that point.
Scott Crocco: Thanks, John. So, Kevin, let’s talk about operating margin versus prior year, right, for the Merchant segment, down 300 basis points. Of that, let’s call it, 100 basis points is the weather impact. And again as we talked about, that was costs seen in the second quarter that we are committed to recover over the course of Q3 and Q4, right. Then we also mentioned that there was a prior year sale, let’s call that impact – that’s a one-time item that doesn’t repeal, let’s call that impact about 50 basis points. Also then the dynamic that was talked about, Simon’s comments around – in China around the wholesale market, the pricing environment and the fact that we are bringing on new capacity, let’s call that another 50 basis points. And then the balance is what John was talking about, costs in excess of productivity actions of about 100 basis points that we need to make sure that we are taking the actions to drive improvement going forward.
John McGlade: I hate to jump back on this question, but just to reinforce the point we are answering the specifics because of the question. They aren’t acceptable in my views and we have got to be and are focused on not having this dialogue on this business going forward, because we are delivering on what this business is capable of.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I appreciate the color. It’s very helpful. If I can switch gears to the tonnage segment, you had outages as you mentioned in the quarter, it sounds like there will be some as well in 3Q. What is the sequential volume differential that you expect looking ahead to 3Q? How much of a pickup might there be as we move forward?
Scott Crocco: So, this is Scott, Kevin. So Q3 versus Q2, kind of flat, a similar sort of level of maintenance, with the fourth quarter seeing a reduction in maintenance expense and of course the corresponding impact on volumes as well.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you very much.
John McGlade: Just to clarify, Scott, right, that was a comment about the outages impact on volume, not a more general comment about volumes.
Scott Crocco: Yes, thank you.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Perfect, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Just a couple of questions, first on Merchant, a lot of people have been talking about economic improvement in Europe. You have got a large Merchant presence in Europe. I am surprised that wouldn’t have offset some of the weather related issues in North America. So perhaps you could comment on that. And then secondly, are you still looking for $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS from new project startups this year and more importantly how do you see that unfolding in 2015?
Scott Crocco: So first – this is – Don, this is Scott. So first on the Merchant Europe, we did see good volume growth in the liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen. The area that we saw the weakness was in packaged gases that offset that, right. Then your other question around $0.20 to $0.25 for the year, yes, that’s still our outlook. And in terms of FY ‘15, we haven’t quantified what that was – that’s going to be, but it will be higher than $0.20 to $0.25 as we bring on stream these projects that are in backlog. And again, I will reiterate that overwhelmingly these are take or pay contracts that don’t have volume risk.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: And Scott, you talked about the drag on return on capital from the build out of new projects and I know what about the drag on earnings, I know depreciation alone is up about $100 million over the last couple of years, that’s about $0.35 a share on a full year basis, what other drags do you see on earnings as you in advance are starting up these new projects?
Scott Crocco: So I guess if I just take a step back and think about the levers that we have in order to drive earnings going forward, right. So as we brought on capacity in the past, so we have talked about this, we have existing capacity that can be leveraged. This is the $1 billion or so of existing sales capacity that’s already installed when brought on stream is a 30% to 40% incremental margin given that we are already incurring the depreciation. Then there is the projects that are in backlog that we have already talked about and we are getting those executed on time and on budget, also drive earnings growth. And then execution and focus on productivity to more than offset the impact from inflation to again drive improvement to the bottom line and earnings.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Hi good morning.
John McGlade: Good morning Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Can you remind me when exactly Tees Valley comes on in 2015 and what’s the size of the PCEC Weinan, China oxygen facility that comes on in the fourth quarter?
Scott Crocco: So we have talked about kind of the commissioning in Tees Valley 1 to start at the end of fiscal ‘14, but frankly, that’s just the beginning of the commissioning. So we will be coming on line early in fiscal ‘15. And in terms of PCEC, I don’t think we have quantified the size of it. We are expecting that to be on stream here by the end of the year.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay. And then if I could just make a suggestion, your maintenance cost seems to be large and volatile quarter-by-quarter, perhaps you can disclose what they are. And I don’t think that it would harm you from a competitive standpoint and it might make the modeling of the divisions a little bit easier? Thanks very much.
Scott Crocco: Thanks for the feedback, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Sheehan with SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Good morning.
John McGlade : Good morning.
Scott Crocco: Good morning.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Just wanted to follow-up on the CEO succession issue, I understand these things do take some time, but maybe you could give us a little color on the process and what is – why does it take so long. I am sensing some frustration among investors I talked to you about the pace of the process, do you expect this to last weeks or months or is it going to last all the way through the current CEO tenure as it’s been disclosed?
John McGlade: So I said in my opening remarks, Jim that the Board takes this very seriously and they are committed to the obligations and their fiduciary responsibilities that we disclosed earlier this fiscal year. From a process point of view, what we said in the past, the process is not that complicated in the context of the process, which is you have got to hire an executive search firm, you have got to come up with a list of viable candidates, you have to vet that list of viable candidates and then you have to interview that list of viable candidates and that interview process is with the search committee and then ultimately our full board and that does take some time. But having said that, we understand what our responsibilities are, the board understands what their responsibilities and commitments are and they are executing to them.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Thank you, John. Just another question on Performance Materials growth, it’s been very strong recently, it seems to be broad-based. Do you think that growth is sustainable here and what gives you confidence that it will continue?
John McGlade: Well, I would just say, our focus in that business for a long time has really been to grow at two times the underlying growth in whatever market it’s in through new products that meet the technical, environmental and performance needs of our customers and that team in my opinion has done a very, very good job leveraging their knowledge of the markets they are pursuing, the technologies and product offerings they have to play and the customer base that’s going to help them drive new products into the marketplace and then broadly penetrate adjacent markets as well.
James Sheehan - SunTrust: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
John McGlade: Hi, Mike.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Good morning. If we could look at the margin performance in the merchant business by geography, I guess kind of relative to that overall 300 basis point decline year-on-year, where have we seen margins weaken the most and what regions have maybe been a little bit more stable?
Scott Crocco: So, this is Scott, Mike. So, obviously the weather impact is the North America comment, right. The Europe margin has been under stress, again as I mentioned due to the weakness in packaged gases, but I also just want to reiterate that we are taking steps in that business to right-size the organization and make sure that we are focused on the end-markets where we see long-term profitable growth. And then the South America, particularly with Indura, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that’s been an area where the economy frankly has been below what our expectations have been, but again our acquisition in Indura was based off of a integrated gases marrying a great business that they had from a packaged gases with our liquid bulk and onsite capabilities. And so we are happy with that investment and see growth opportunities going forward, even if we are at a current economic situation that is below our expectation.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: And then in Asia, would we have seen margin kind of weaker than that negative 300 basis points or not quite as bad?
Scott Crocco: So, again a little bit of a dip for the reasons that Simon described during the comments as well around some of the pricing pressures as well as the wholesale dynamics in that market.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Right, okay. And then looking at the 6% volume growth number in the U.S. and Canada, can you quantify how much of that was from EPCO? I think it’s been about 5% in the past couple of quarters and maybe comment more broadly now that you have owned that business for a few quarters, how is that business trending kind of – are you pleased with the acquisition and what has it done for your merchant capabilities, broadly speaking?
Scott Crocco: Right. So, you are right, it’s been in the 5% range or so similar to what we have said in the past. We are happy with the investment and it’s going well. We are obviously going through the integration and going after the synergies associated with that acquisition, at the same time recognizing it’s a nice complement to our offerings of CO2, particularly in the foods arena. And so – and we have already seen the impact and the synergistic opportunities from a end-market of having that offering as well.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: And then last question I have is just on tonnage and you have noted customer outages in the business creating pressure kind of a few times and it doesn’t sound like the pressure stops here in the third quarter. Over that time, we have seen volumes kind of flat to declining despite new projects, despite the Gulf Coast pipeline coming on-stream and these trends in volumes have been detrimentally returns as well. Can you just maybe delve into a little more detail in what explains the volume performance and why are we seeing such volume pressure at a time when refineries and other customers on the Gulf Coast, it would seem like they should be running about flat out right now?
Scott Crocco: Yes. So again, I will just reiterate, Mike that this is a high outage season and that’s what we are seeing the impact on the volumes coupled again with the termination that we had in prior years, so be careful of the comparison point, but that’s the main driver of the volume.
John McGlade: But to emphasize again as we have said is what’s really important is the demand from our refining customers on the U.S. Gulf Coast is strong. We talked about a couple of new capacity additions that we are bringing on there as well as some new business opportunities. So we remain optimistic and feel good about our position down there.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: But I guess is if we are talking about outages and having a seasonality around outages and maintenance costs, this quarter was bad, last quarter was maybe not quite so bad, but it was a factor last quarter and you are pointing to Q3 as also being kind of quarter-to-quarter flattish or similar amount of outages. So I guess again getting to maybe, Jeff Zekauskas’ point, maybe we need a little bit more detail on exactly what the drag is each quarter, so that we can understand kind of what the underlying performance looks like.
John McGlade: Yes. And I think Scott said we will consider that comment that when Jeff brought it up and I appreciate you reemphasizing. I think one of the things you have got to understand about this business and maybe we have got to do a better job explaining it is that you don’t take an outage on every hydrogen plant every year and it just so happened that a number, a greater number than typical given the size of our hydrogen fleet has occurred this year in these quarters. And so point noted about us being able to perhaps show some more light to that and we will go back and think about how we do that.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Alright, appreciate that. Thanks gentlemen.
John McGlade: Thanks Mike.
Scott Crocco: Thanks Mike.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question regarding the sequencing of earnings and you were pretty clear on the one half versus second half, but I guess if I look at your third quarter guidance, the midpoint is kind of $1.44, $1.45, that basically implies the fourth quarter has got to be somewhere in the $1.65, $1.66 kind of range. That’s a much larger jump than you have pretty much ever had going from a 3Q to 4Q. So I guess what’s driving that, is it the lumpiness of the projects or I guess how should we think about what’s different this time around versus kind of past second half sequencing?
John McGlade: So, John thanks for the question. The same fundamental drivers that I described in the second half versus the first half are true for the Q2 to Q3 walk and for the most part the Q3 and the Q4 walk, right. So again just to reiterate, about two-thirds of the increase is driven by specific items as opposed to just broad-based general business improvement. So again, let’s talk about the third quarter versus the second with the increment weather impact that we saw here in the second quarter, $0.03 to $0.04 not repeating and getting a couple of cents recovery on price, that’s going to be call it a $0.06 step up. Cost reduction efforts will continue again at a stepped up level for a couple of cents. Maintenance, as I mentioned before, roughly flat in the third quarter versus the second quarter and then we are going to start seeing even a bigger impact from new plans coming on-stream, and again, the rest is going to be from just base business improvement. And then again I will point out that the other element is in the fourth quarter, we will see a decline in maintenance relative to what we have seen in both the second and third quarter and we will see a bigger impact of the new on-stream.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. Thanks for the granularity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Hi, guys. Good morning.
John McGlade: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: John, given what you and Corning are working on, there was a time when you thought merchant margins could be closer to 20%, do you still think that’s an area of potential for the business longer term?
John McGlade: Absolutely. This business needs to be a high-teen business on a global basis when it’s at steady state. And I have made that very clear to Corning, I have made that very clear to his leadership team, we need to do that. Now, I believe while – and I want to be clear, we gave you some granularity on what happened this quarter and I don’t want anyone to walk away thinking those are excuses that they happen, they happen, but that’s not how we can run this business. And Corning and his team completely understand that and are focused on returning it to the level of profitability that it’s capable of.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Okay, great. And then just in terms of China, can you give us sort of your thoughts on where capacity utilization is either for the industry or for yourself just to give us a gauge of you sort of talked it might take a couple of years to fill that up?
Simon Moore: Yes, Mike, this is Simon. So, as we shared with you, in Asia our overall LOX/LIN capacity utilization is in the mid 70s. And I would say on balance it’s not hugely dissimilar in China. The slightly different dynamic you got to appreciate is we are absolutely seeing good LOX/LIN volume growth in China. Again, we are also though bringing on capacity additions. And I will just reiterate what I said earlier, these are capacity additions that we made decisions on a few years ago. We have not made any decisions that new capacity in the liquid business in China in the last 18 months. So, that’s clear for us. And I think you are seeing in the industry in a similar mode.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just quickly back on the merchant piece, where you talk about weather, it’s not so much the weather impact as it is. I am understanding this is a power increase that the cold weather led to higher natural gas prices, which led to higher electric power prices, which are your input in the merchant business, is that right?
Scott Crocco: Yes, that’s right. So, this is Scott, David. So, while there were some dislocations, the biggest driver of the weather impact that we saw in the second quarter was from power, including especially in the Northeast and the Midwest where on the increment power is going to be – the feedstock for power is going to be natural gas and there was a big run up in natural gas. And so that’s been – that was the biggest driver, so higher variable cost or power cost that we are committed to recouping here in the second half of the year.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Okay. It sounds like you may have started taking action, but given the fact that you are saying over the next two quarters that won’t hit a full sort of run-rate until sometime mid this quarter and then have a full impact the following quarter, correct?
Scott Crocco: Right. So, we saw little bit higher costs in the second quarter. We saw some of those costs that were recouped and that number that we gave you $0.03 to $0.04 is net. And now as we go forward, we are going to recover that couple of cents here in the next quarter and then we would expect again $0.02 in the fourth quarter kind of flat Q3 to Q4. And so overall, it will be a scratch for the year, $0.03 to $0.04 of bad news seen here in the second quarter, $0.02 favorable in both Q3 and Q4.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Perfect, okay. And then just last question on lower equity affiliate income, I believe you said that you expected that to rebound next quarter. I am just trying to understand what is the dynamic that’s going to make that improve next quarter relative to this quarter?
Scott Crocco: Right. So this quarter, there was some one-time kind of non run-rate items that were in there that won’t repeat. And so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the underlying performance in general in the equity affiliates is solid. And so it’s the absence of those non run-rate items that we are confident they are going to see an increase in equity affiliate in the third quarter.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird: Got it. Okay, thank you.
John McGlade - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer: Just to wrap up, thanks Derrick and thank you all for tuning in today. I just wanted to leave you with the thoughts that our focus on increasing shareholder value remains. Our future prospects are strong given our record project backlog and the significant leverage we have on our existing assets. We are committed to delivering on the strategic goals that we set out for ourself earlier this year and shared with you. And I’d like you to thank you for joining us today and have a safe and great day.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Whitney. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products' First Quarter Results Teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO. John will make a few opening remarks, Scott will review our results and update our outlook, and I will provide a perspective on each of our operating segments. After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We issued our earnings release this morning. It's available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on this slide, and at the end of today's earnings release, the explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.
John E. McGlade: Thank you, Simon, and let me also wish everyone a good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Please turn to Slide 3. We delivered on our commitments during the first quarter of fiscal year '14. We continued to execute on our strong backlog, including bringing onstream 2 new projects in China; execute on our asset loading plans, with strong volume growth in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials; deliver on our cost reduction programs. We are on track and seeing the savings from the program we announced last quarter and we remain focused on winning profitable new projects. Together, these factors enabled us to deliver the Q1 earnings results you see today, which are at the top of our guidance range. Our focus has not changed, and we remain committed to delivering on our priorities for 2014. The investments we have made over the past several years, the position of our portfolio and our ability to execute going forward are key drivers for Air Products' future. We believe shareholders will realize increasingly stronger returns as earnings growth from the profitable projects in our backlog contribute in 2014 and accelerate in 2015 and 2016. Now let me turn over the call to Scott to review our results.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 4, let me now take you through our fiscal Q1 results. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were flat excluding the PUI business. Overall, sales were 1% lower than prior year on slightly lower volumes and stable pricing, partially offset by higher energy passthrough. Volumes were higher in all segments except for Tonnage Gases. Last quarter, we told you that a significant number of our customers would have scheduled outages in 2014. The reduced volume you see in Tonnage is largely a result of this and was expected. Sequentially, overall sales decreased 2% on 3% weaker volumes. This was mainly due to seasonality in our Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials businesses and the outages in Tonnage. Operating income of $386 million increased 4% versus prior year on strong results in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment and Energy business segments. Our operating margin of 15.1% was up 60 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to a more favorable business mix as higher volumes across most businesses were partially offset by Tonnage outages. Sequentially, operating income was down 8% and margin declined 120 basis points, primarily due to volume seasonality and higher costs driven by Tonnage maintenance outages. Net income and diluted earnings per share were up 4% and 3%, respectively, versus last year. Sequentially, net income and EPS were both down 9%. Our return on capital employed declined by 130 basis points to 9.9% as a result of our higher capital employed and the Indura acquisition. This remains well above our 8% cost of capital. As a reminder, we are developing, executing and operating good projects that will be accretive to ROCE over the next few years. Turning to Slide 5, you can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.34 increased by $0.04 versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.12, driven by Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment. The positive impact on profits was partially driven by mix, primarily the positive impact of more higher-margin sales of equipment business. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.05, due primarily to higher variable cost in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials. Net cost performance was $0.01 unfavorable, primarily due to tonnage maintenance outages offsetting the benefit of our 2012 and 2013 cost reduction programs. Currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.01 unfavorable. Equity affiliate income was also $0.01 unfavorable. And lower interest expense was offset by higher shares outstanding. Overall, we delivered a good quarter, with earnings at the top end of our guidance range, based on strong execution and a more profitable business mix. Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 6. Overall, the Merchant Gases segment had a strong quarter with stable pricing and strong volume growth resulting in increased utilization rates in both U.S., Canada and Europe. Merchant Gases sales of over $1 billion were up 4% versus last year on 4% higher volumes. Liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes were again up in all regions, partially offset by packaged gas demand weakness in Europe and lower helium volumes globally due to supply challenges. Sales were down 1% sequentially on lower volumes, primarily due to weaker seasonal volumes in U.S./Canada and lower helium availability. We continue to see challenges with reduced availability from our helium feedstock suppliers. In one case, the large supplier moved an outage into Q1, negatively impacting available volumes during this past quarter. But this won't impact overall FY '14 availability as the unplanned outage was used to address maintenance that had been planned for later in the fiscal year. Let me now spend a minute updating you on how our helium projects are progressing and what we are doing to help improve the situation. Our Wyoming plant is ready. Our supplier's plant has been in operation and so we expect to receive our crude helium feedstock very soon, which will enable us to begin to provide product to the market as we move through the quarter. The Colorado facility we announced last quarter is on schedule for FY '15 startup. And we have worked with another of our existing U.S. suppliers to expand our natural gas pipeline collection system to increase available helium molecules. We expect to see this increase next quarter. With this new capacity, we are optimistic we will see increased helium supply volumes over the next year. But it is important to remember that the U.S. government supply, about a third of the world's helium supply today, is declining each year as the reserves are depleted. To frame this, our new Wyoming plant, when fully ramped, will offset about 1 year of decline in Air Products share of available helium from the U.S. government. In the Liquid Bulk area, contract signings were very strong, up significantly over last year, with Asia and U.S./Canada showing the most growth. We are seeing the positive impact of last year's strong contract signings on our current volumes and are pleased about future growth from the more recent signings. Merchant Gases operating income of $169 million was down 1% versus prior year and down 4% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.1% was down 80 basis points compared to last year and down 60 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, the higher volumes improved operating income, but this was more than offset by the impact of price versus variable costs, primarily power and fuel. Overall, pricing was flat, but this includes a positive price contribution from helium. LOX/LIN pricing was not able to fully recover increased variable costs. Sequentially, operating income was down primarily on the lower volumes, and margins were impacted by the under recovery of increased variable costs. Now let's take a look at the Merchant business by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In U.S./Canada, sales were up 4% on 2% higher volumes and 2% higher pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were up 4% on strength in the Oilfield Services, chemicals, food and metals markets. We saw a positive volume contribution from the EPCO acquisition, but helium volumes were down due to supply limitations. After 3 quarters of solid LOX/LIN volume growth, we have seen capacity utilization move up to the upper 70s. There's still capacity to sell in our system, but it's great to see the increased loadings. Overall, pricing was positive from both helium and LOX/LIN, but we did not fully recover higher LOX/LIN variable costs. We announced 2 new production facilities for our North America CO2 business in Wisconsin and Iowa, strengthening our position in the Midwest to support growth at existing and new customers. We are pleased with the EPCO acquisition, both in terms of the base CO2 business and the opportunities to provide a full product solution to customers who need CO2 and other gases. In Europe, sales were up 3% versus last year due to currency, as both volumes and prices were flat. We did see positive LOX/LIN and LAR volumes, but this was offset by lower helium and lower cylinder volumes. LOX/LIN volume growth was strong in Central Europe and Southern Europe, recognizing the growth is from the weak base last year. Cylinder volumes were down across the continent as construction remains weak. Overall pricing was flat, with positive helium pricing offsetting negative LOX/LIN and LAR pricing. While LOX/LIN variable costs were flat, the lower pricing did impact margins. And LOX/LIN plant loadings have increased to the high 70s on the stronger volumes. In Asia, sales were up 6% versus last year on 8% higher volumes and 2% lower price. LOX/LIN volumes were again up double digits across the whole region and in China. Liquid argon volumes and our micro bulk product line continue to show significant improvements while helium was down on supply limitations. Plant loadings remain in the mid-70s with capacity additions roughly matching the volume increase. Pricing was down in the LOX/LIN and LAR business, particularly in China, driven in part by the wholesale market. The lower prices and higher variable costs impacted margins. The Latin America results in the segment include our wholly-owned business in Brazil and our majority-owned business Indura. While our equity affiliate joint venture in Mexico is not in the segment results, our Mexico business did see strong LOX/LIN volume growth of mid to high single digits, primarily driven by nitrogen for enhanced oil recovery. Underlying sales were up 2% on 1% higher volumes and 1% higher prices, and there was a negative 7% impact from currency. Brazil LOX/LIN volumes were up as our new liquid plant in São Paulo enhances our ability to serve customers despite economic weakness. Cylinder volumes were down as we looked to optimize our customer mix. Indura volumes were up slightly, with modest economic growth moderated by delays in new mining and power projects in Chile and economic weakness in Colombia and Argentina. We were pleased to sign a new small on-site nitrogen plant, likely an opportunity that neither Indura nor Air Products could have won alone. LOX/LIN plant capacity utilization is in the mid-70s. And overall pricing was stable, with strength in helium and weakness in LOX/LIN under recovering variable costs including inflationary pressures. Please turn to Slide 8. As Scott mentioned and as we expected, the Tonnage Gases segment was impacted by higher level of outages. We take the opportunity to do maintenance work on our plants during our customers planned outages, and this impacts both maintenance costs and sales. Tonnage Gases sales of $808 million were down 10% versus last year. Gases volumes were down 10% as strong demand on the U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen system continued but was more than offset by planned outages and lower Latin America volumes. Lower PUI volumes impacted sales by 3% while higher energy passthrough added 2% and currency added 1%. We have now fully exited the PUI business as of the end of Q1. For Q1, PUI sales were down about $30 million and operating income was about flat versus last year. PUI will be a negative year-on-year comparison for the rest of FY '14 as we had positive earnings from PUI in FY '13. For the full year, we still expect PUI sales down about $140 million and about a $0.10 negative EPS impact. For the segment, sequential sales were down 3% on 4% lower volumes due to the outages, partially offset by 1% from currency. Operating income of $118 million was down 15% versus prior year and down 13% sequentially, primarily due to maintenance costs and lower volumes associated with these outages. Operating margin of 14.6% was down 80 basis points versus prior year on 150 basis points on the lower operating income. During the quarter, we brought the XLX project onstream in China and bidding activity remains strong. We would not be surprised if we had additional project announcement soon. Please turn to Slide 9. We'd strong performance in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment this quarter with solid volume growth and positive contribution from our cost actions. Segment sales of $579 million were up 5% versus last year on 6% higher volumes and 1% lower price. Sequentially, sales were flat, with currency offsetting lower volumes. Versus prior year, Electronics sales were up 4%, primarily driven by higher equipment and on-site sales while growth in our ongoing Materials business offset the impact of product exits. Electronics sales were up 3% sequentially on higher equipment activity. Performance Materials sales were up 8% versus last year as we saw positive growth across all product lines in all major regions. Autos, coatings and North America residential housing were strong while nonresidential construction continued to be weak. Sequentially, PMD sales were down 4%, which is less than the typical seasonal reduction. Operating income of $84 million was up 36% versus prior year on the higher volumes and solid cost performance. We are on track in delivering on our business restructuring and cost reduction programs. Compared to last year, we had good news from a specific equipment sale that was roughly offset with a negative impact from inventory revaluation. Operating margin was up 320 basis points to 14.4% on a higher operating income. Sequentially, operating income was down 13% and operating margin was down 210 basis points, primarily due to inventory revaluation. The first portion of our supply to Samsung in Xi'an, China came onstream during the quarter. We announced this project in 2012 and will continue to bring on additional facets throughout the rest of FY '14 to support the ramp up of Samsung Electronics' largest ever overseas investment. Now please turn to Slide 10. Equipment and Energy segment delivered strong profits this quarter as project activity remained robust. Sales of $111 million were up 4% versus prior year and down 6% sequentially. Operating income of $21 million was up 144% over a slow prior-year quarter and flat sequentially. Versus last year, more higher margin LNG projects and less lower margin ASU activity drove the profit increase. The backlog of $343 million is down 12% from last year and down 15% versus last quarter. In general, we continue to see a high level of project development activity, but a few projects have delayed their final decisions. However, just last week, we were pleased to announce an order to supply our leading technology and equipment to Technip and JGC to build Russia's largest LNG production and export facility. We will supply 3 exchangers supporting the overall 16.5 million tonne per year project on the Yamal Peninsula. And earlier in January, we dedicated our new LNG manufacturing facility in Florida that will enable us to support strong LNG market growth for many years to come. As we said last quarter, our Tees Valley energy-from-waste projects are on budget, on schedule and meeting our safety goals. We expect Tees Valley 1 to begin commissioning in late FY '14 and be fully onstream in early FY '15. Tees Valley 2 is expected to start up in early 2016. Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 11, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Economic activity in the first quarter of 2014 was about as we expected in most regions. Given current economic conditions, we continue to be cautious with regard to economic growth in 2014, expecting modest growth throughout the year. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we are maintaining a manufacturing growth forecast of 2% to 4% for our fiscal year. In the U.S., while some policy uncertainty is reduced, important issues remain, including a congressional debt ceiling debate and potential changes to the speed of tapering and interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve. Any mistakes in fiscal or monetary policy could dampen growth. In Europe, weak growth conditions remain due to the continuation of austerity programs, restricted access to credit and high unemployment. While there is positive manufacturing growth in most European countries, we expect improvement to be moderate. In Asia, manufacturing growth in China and Japan has stabilized since recovering from a trough in the second half of FY '13. Other Asian markets, including Korea and Taiwan, continued underperforming. We expect a gradual acceleration of manufacturing growth to continue, led by China. In South America, manufacturing activity has been below expectations. As the larger markets of the global economy improve, especially China, we expect modest but improving conditions through increasing global trade. We expect electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2014 after 2 years of weakness. However, electronics on-site bidding activity remains slow. Outside electronics, our project development activity and contract signings continue to be strong, and we would not be surprised if we had new project announcements soon. Our FY '14 capital spending guidance remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion, similar to last year's CapEx spending level. Also, our backlog for the quarter remain unchanged at approximately $3.5 billion. You can see an updated list of our major projects in the Appendix, Slide 14. We are maintaining our EPS guidance range of $5.70 to $5.90 per share for the year. Our guidance for Q2 is for earnings per share of $1.32 to $1.37, based on the following factors: on the positive side, volume improvement in both Merchant and Performance Materials. We expect to see higher volumes in North America and Europe, partially offset by some softness in volumes in Asia due to the Lunar New Year and in South America due to the summer vacation season. No inventory revaluation and further progress on our cost reduction initiatives. Offsetting this sequential improvement in Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to higher maintenance spending as more of our refining customers begin taking their annual outages. Another sequential headwind impacting our Tonnage results will be our exit from the PUI business. And in Equipment and Energy, we expect lower profits in the second quarter based on project timing. Now let me turn the call back to John to wrap up.
John E. McGlade: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 12. In conclusion, our performance this quarter was driven by our ability to execute effectively on the strategic priorities we set out at the beginning of this year. We continue to stay focused on executing against our backlog, winning profitable new projects, loading our existing assets and driving productivity and cost improvements. Let me now take a moment to briefly update you on our progress in the search for the next CEO. As you know, the board has retained an executive search firm and is looking at candidates who have the right skills and experience to take our company forward. I can't give much more insight than that, but I want you to know that the process is well underway and the board and I are confident that we will find the right leader for Air Products. Finally, as I said at our annual shareholder meeting last week, having spent 38 years with Air Products, I can say with the utmost confidence that while individuals may come and go, the values that drive our organization remain deeply rooted. These values define who we are and distinguish us from other organizations. I cannot speak highly enough to the employees at our company and I am immensely proud to be a part of this great group of people. With that, thank you. And now we are ready to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Two quick questions. First, can you help a little bit as you think about the next quarter bridge on a year-over-year basis, how much of a headwind you have on PUI and how much of a tailwind from cost productivity that you've achieved? And secondly, on the sort of customer negotiations, are you seeing sort of any sort of pushback on projected project timing as customers reevaluate project costs? Or can you give us some sense of how that is being balanced currently?
M. Scott Crocco: Sure, Laurence. This is Scott. So first the question regarding the PUI. We look forward to next quarter. I think if I got your question right, looking at Q2 versus prior year, what do we think the headwind would be for PUI? I would put that at about $0.03 or so. I think that's also in line with what we would expect to see from the cost saving actions, both for the provision that we took here in the last quarter as well as the full year impact that we saw from the provision back in 2012. And just a comment on that, I just want to reemphasize that we are on budget and on track to deliver the benefits from those provisions. The second question I think you had was in terms of the customer negotiation. Let me just make a quick comment and I'll turn it over to John. I think from a -- first of all, in terms of projects, they're underway. There's been no project stoppage. Big projects sometimes get delayed, but there's no shutdown or anything like that. Maybe I'll turn it over to John for additional comments.
John E. McGlade: Sure, Laurence. It's John McGlade. Yes, on -- in the current bidding activity, these are large projects, large projects that the front end take some time to work their way through feed typically. Bottom line though is when we look at our CapEx forecast for this year and when we look at the bidding activity as we go out, I don't think there's anything abnormal in the context of what we've seen in prior years.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Don Carson.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Question on Merchant. You had an uptick in operating rates. And I guess the question is, you'd talked in the past of 35% incremental margins on Merchant. So why wouldn't that additional business have helped you more than offset some of the increases in variable costs and lead to a margin improvement there?
M. Scott Crocco: Right. So, Don, this is Scott. So absolutely, when we look at the incremental loading impact, we'd still put it at 35% incremental margin or so. It's just a matter of the timing from the raw material increases, principally from power and fuel. We recognize -- we're trying to work the pricing environment as always, balancing it with volume. Sometimes, there's a lag when we see the cost step up from the time when we take the pricing action. But we've seen the capacity utilization increase and we're getting those incremental margins we expected.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then on the project backlog. You had 2 projects come off, startups in China. So can you quantify in dollar terms where the backlog -- where you started the quarter and where you ended the quarter, and how you expect that to unfold as the year progresses?
M. Scott Crocco: So I would say there's always going to be lumpiness as things come on and come off. And so we're trying to look at this on a total basis. We would expect it to be bouncing around a little bit, but roughly I would say 3.5 or so, maybe down a little bit just on the timing of when these things come onstream.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, you -- all of your earnings growth this year is back-end loaded. So what changes in the second half of the year? Is it acceleration in contribution from your productivity programs? Is it project startups? What -- if you can just go through some of those dynamics?
M. Scott Crocco: Sure. So let's think about it. Again, this is Scott. And let's think about it in terms of the things we've been talking about: loading the assets, bringing the projects on, and delivering on our productivity. So from an asset loading perspective, we continue to maintain our outlook from the economy, coupled with good signings that we've had. And so the combination of those 2 will see the asset loading continue. We continue to work to bring the projects on in the backlog. And as we said in the past, there'll be bigger impact in the back half of the year. And we're executing to the cost reduction program that we announced last quarter. So all of those things combined will translate into a robust second half of the year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: John, I'm just curious if you might give us some sense, maybe on a bigger picture question. Curious if you think the gases demand to GDP multiplier, could you tell me how it compares around the world and how you particularly see it changing, if any, in Asia?
John E. McGlade: So yes. Typically, you know that the demand, the GDP, we actually like to track it closer to the sort of an industrial output or manufacturing type of number. Varies almost on an S-curve as a function of the maturity of the particular geography you're talking about. Having said that, there have been -- and that typically is 1 to 2, somewhere in that -- in a very sort of middle part of the S-curve, it could be a little higher than 2. What's changed that, I think, to the positive in terms of demand for all gases if you want to speak to within that context, is the phenomena that's happened in hydrogen and the phenomena that's happened in gasification in particular in China in driving hydrogen for refining globally, if you will, as clean fuel standards translate around the globe and then oxygen specifically for gasification in China. So I think that those rules of thumb are good over a long period of time in any given year, obviously given in particular my comments around these larger tonnage type of volumes. As Scott used the word, they could be a little lumpy based on the timing on when those projects come in to the P&L. But if you think about, one last point, if you think about what ultimately drives the demand for industrial gases and try to sort of track that towards the macro trends in the world, I firmly and strongly believe the drive for energy efficiency, the drive for increased throughput or productivity in the manufacturing process, the drive for an improving quality of end products, whatever they may be and sort of the over arching environmental regulations and policies bode well for this type -- this industry as we go into the future.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And if I might ask a quick follow-up, can you discuss what the philosophy or basis for the -- those recent retention agreements were?
John E. McGlade: Sure. I mean, to me, they're normal course of business. We look at that all the time. And what we wanted to do was not tie any new CEO's hands, but really ensure that we have a smooth transition with the next management team here.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: The improvement in electronics you noted, are you seeing that now and -- or is that going to be a little bit more maybe June, September driven?
John E. McGlade: I'm sorry. I missed the second part.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Is it going to be more second half loaded in terms of the improvement there, or are you seeing the improvement in electronics now?
M. Scott Crocco: So some of the improvement that we've seen in electronics is driven by our delivery systems. And we also typically see a seasonal first half being a little bit weaker, second half being a little bit stronger. But I think we've focused our portfolio on the right products, materials and -- process materials and advanced materials. And in addition to the focus on volume growth, we're also taking the cost actions to get our portfolio where it needs to be long term.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, John, I think you've mentioned that signings of new projects continue to be pretty healthy here. Are the returns still pretty good in those areas? And then, when you think about the second half of the year, can you give us a feel for how much of those projects coming onstream will contribute?
John E. McGlade: Sure. First, on -- I think, Mike, you know, you can never fall in love with an on-site project because you're locking in the return on the day that you sign that project. And so we've been through in many of these other calls. We got a fairly robust process to decide how we're going to price a particular project. And if we can achieve the returns that we want from that project, we're going to walk from it. And that is at least how I view tonnage projects. And I'm very comfortable that the quality of the returns of the projects that we've been signing over the last number of years that are both in the backlog and the new bidding activities meet that criteria. At the beginning of the year, and Scott may want to add a little more comment to this, at the beginning of the year, we didn't really lay out quarter by quarter the impact of new projects. But I believe we said, it'd be $0.20 to $0.25 in earnings this year. And as we noted in this release, we started up 2 smaller of those projects. Scott, you might want to add a couple more comments.
M. Scott Crocco: Right, sure. So as John mentioned, I think I mentioned earlier, the second half is going to be a bigger impact from new projects coming onstream. Here in the first quarter, maybe we saw a few cents. However, we expect that to increase sequentially going forward.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: My question is on Tonnage. If I look back to the mid-2009 period, Tonnage was down 6% or 7%. And given the fact that it's down 10% in volume this quarter and based on your EPS walk on Slide 11, might be implying it gets worse from here. I'm just trying to get my head around why that would be given the current situation. It seems that, that decline is pretty severe for just some customer shutdowns.
M. Scott Crocco: So, David, this is Scott. So first of all, I just want to make sure as you're looking at it that you recognize there's the PUI divestiture.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Right.
M. Scott Crocco: And then once you adjust for that, I mean, the big impact has been the outages of our customers, and then we take our maintenance when they go down. And then going forward, we would actually expect to see a little bit of a step up in the second quarter as well from outages. And they had, as I think I mentioned in the call last quarter, we had a contract termination in Latin America as well. All those things contributing to volumes being down. That said, we are well positioned to grow in this part of the portfolio going forward.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up. On Merchant volumes in Europe, it seems like eurozone industrial production just started picking up maybe November, I don't want to say that one point makes a trend. But as you're looking at that, the outlook for Merchant gas volumes in Europe in 2014, are you more encouraged given the economic data that you're seeing lately?
M. Scott Crocco: There's always things that are bumping around in terms of headliners and so forth. I think as we said at the beginning of the fiscal year guidance was kind of manufacturing output for the eurozone to be in the 0 to 2%. And seeing sequential improvement, adjusting for seasonalities as we go forward, I think we've seen that, recognizing there's ebbs and flows and there's different strengths and weaknesses across the geographies. As well as acknowledging that from a LOX/LIN perspective, we've seen an increase, recognizing that we've seen more softness from the cylinder side as well, driven by construction.
Operator: We'll take our next question from James Sheehan with SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I was just wondering if you could comment on the Merchant Gases business a little bit. I think you referenced some wins that you had versus the prior year. Just what is the tone of your net of what you're seeing overall wins versus losses and what's the trend there?
M. Scott Crocco: Right. So this is Scott again, Jim. It's a good question. When we look across the portfolio, each of the different regions in the Merchant business, we've got solid signings, well up year-on-year. Team's done a very good job. If we all look at the different elements of the volume growth, and I'll take some broad brushes, largely applies to each of the different regions. We've seen the base volume growth in line with the economic environment that we're operating in. We've seen the impact from these signings. As we recall, we've seen improved signings now for some time and we're seen those volumes come onstream. And as we look at in a loss business, lost for any reason, including spot or seasonal activity, that's been in line with historical trends. And so overall, we feel good about the volumes that we've been able to deliver and we're focused on continuing to deliver profitable growth going forward.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: And just on LOX/LIN pricing, it's not moving up yet. I'm just wondering what level of utilization you think needs to be achieved before you get some leverage on price.
M. Scott Crocco: Well, so -- and you saw I think we moved up both to the high 70s in both U.S., Canada and Europe. Recognize, these businesses are very, very local. We're looking in managing the situation in each of those different sub-geographies, and making sure we're striking a balance between price and volume and focus on long-term profitable growth going forward. So as those utilizations move up into the 80s, that will improve the pricing environment. Again, recognizing that this is a very, very local business and we're managing appropriately based off of all the sub-geographies.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Scott and John, you mentioned the strong signings in Merchant. Are you gaining share do you think in merchant and if so from whom?
John E. McGlade: I don't think we're necessarily gaining share. I'd take you back to Scott's point, which is you really have to look at the sub-geographies to understand the specific loading in those particular areas. What we are doing though is getting the benefit from or the benefits from added commercial resources in the marketplace. So broader coverage and a stronger focus on applications in those geographies where we have product to sell. And so we've talked about this in the past. But over the last 18 months or so, we really have added in the U.S. market and target areas in Asia both sales and technology resources to really drive additions to unloaded assets.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Fair enough. And, John, just on the benefit from new plant startups $0.20, $0.25 this year. What will be for next year, given the high number of plant startups in the back half of this year?
John E. McGlade: So as I said in the script and I'm not sure we're giving you guidance to that at this point, but you can expect a lot more than that in both of those years as the full benefit of this backlog really starts hitting in '15 and '16.
Operator: We'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citibank.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: My the first question on Merchants. You mentioned you're building 2 new CO2 plants. What kind of return on investment do you expect from these 2 plants?
John E. McGlade: Again, we don't typically disclose specific project returns, but these projects fit right into the core of the strategy for acquiring the EPCO facility to give us broader market coverage and broader -- and better distribution supply chain advantages. And as Simon commented in our script, we're very pleased with how the EPCO acquisition has started up both in terms of EPCO performing at its own businesses is exceeding expectations, but also the complementary nature of having CO2 for the food businesses and having a CO2 offering for Oilfield Services has really further helped in the terms of this business and the Merchant business.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then on on-site, you talked about weaker tonnage business spend in Latin America. I'm wondering if you can talk about that in any particular end market where you're seeing that weakness.
M. Scott Crocco: No, obviously, this is really -- this is Scott. We had mentioned in the call last quarter that we had contract terminations. So that's where we're seeing impact to volumes there.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So that's all there is, it's all from the contract terminations?
M. Scott Crocco: Right. That's correct.
John E. McGlade: Correct.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then, you talked about increasing the geographic density of your assets. As the portfolio evolves, what can you comment on your asset density and how you can increase it?
John E. McGlade: So -- I mean, any good industrial gas business looks to continue to increase your density around a given set of assets. You have to have both the market opportunity to do that and that market opportunity means what are the other asset of competitors in that area and their particular applications. We're looking at that at a very local level, so Scott used the subregion area. But we're looking, if you will, at every concentration within a tight geography of a couple of hundred miles as to where can we enhance our position. So those CO2 assets that we were talking about are examples. Or building out a micro-bulk offering in China or in Korea or in North America are other examples of it. So sometimes you're looking at adding a LOX/LIN/LAR plant as we do in the Oilfield Services area. Sometimes you're looking at adding a complementary product line. Frankly, sometimes you're looking at adding those resources I talked from a technology sales point. Each and everyone varies greatly by the dynamics of the market and your position in that market at a very local level. And that's what the team is constantly looking at and doing.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just to follow-up on Tonnage volumes. As the outages come back on line and you anniversaried the contract expiration, would you expect volumes to turn positive in that segment by the end of the fiscal year?
John E. McGlade: So when we look at the outage profile here going through the year, we'd expect the second quarter to increase as folks take additional outages. And then in the back half of the year, we'd expect to see volumes increase, especially during the summer season, which is traditionally the high operating level for the industry.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then second question is for Scott on foreign exchange. We've seen a lot of volatility in the U.S. dollar versus emerging market currencies in particular. Wondering if you have made any changes in your assumptions in that regard in terms of your $5.70 to $5.90 EPS range for the year or whether there are other factors offsetting, how are you thinking about the dollar?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes. So obviously we're not in the business -- I'm not in the business of forecasting currencies. We're certainly not in the business of speculating on them. As we saw in our results this quarter, we saw the euro strengthening. We saw weaknesses in the Chilean peso, the Brazilian real, and I don't know where that's going to move going forward. Frankly, we're talking about just translation. And so it's going to be what it's going to be. What we are focused on is making sure in each of those different market, those local market that we understand the current business environment and we're driving profitable improvement.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then last question, if I may. Can you comment on helium pricing and, I guess more broadly, as you increase your available supply over the next, say, 1 to 2 years, how should we be thinking about the translation into your earnings stream?
John E. McGlade: Simon?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. Thanks, Kevin. I think just first of all was we talked helium prices have been increasing over the last few years while volumes have been declining. The team's done a tremendous job of, quite frankly, there hasn't been a factor we've talked about at the earnings line, it has impacted topline volumes. So as we look to the future and we're optimistic we'll see some increased volumes. I think the rate of the helium price increase probably moderates. But I think that will continue to be relatively neutral at the profit line going forward.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of questions. First on the down 10% volume in Tonnage x PUI, how much of that was outages and how much of that was the contract rolling over?
M. Scott Crocco: The biggest impact -- Duffy, this is Scott. The biggest impact was the outages, with the smaller impact being the contract termination.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, so this was an extraordinarily large turnaround season for your customers, is that the way to think about it?
M. Scott Crocco: I think if we look back at the last few years, last several years, just the timing of when customers are taking the outage, this year's a little bit above average. And again as I mentioned before, we saw outages this quarter, we'd expect to see a little bit of a step up in the number of outages in the impact next quarter and then trailing off in both Q3 and Q4.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. But then year-over-year into next year, that should be a nice tailwind, maybe 5% to 6%. So we should think about maybe the base to grow from next year was $100 million or $850 million as opposed to the $808 million because of the onetime large turnaround season?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes. I mean, there's always different turnarounds. But I think at this point in time, as we look forward to where our customers are telling us they're going to take outages, we would be at a tailwind next year versus this year. Recognize, too, we've done a nice job growing this business over many decades and so as we get more hydrogen, more hydrogen plants, we're going to have more outages, right, as just we -- as we are bigger in this part of the portfolio.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Fair enough. And then, if we jump to the Equipment and Energy business, you guys were fairly, I don't want to say negative on the last quarter, but certainly you were guiding down that segment quarter-over-quarter. Seemed to come in a lot stronger. I would think equipment has a decent lead time to it, but why was that, that it ended up being so much stronger than you guys would have expected a quarter ago?
M. Scott Crocco: Duffy, this is Scott again. This is just timing as we work through various projects. And so nothing major, it's just that the processing of the projects that are in backlog.
Simon R. Moore: We still have the same full year outlook for the segment.
M. Scott Crocco: That's right. It's just timing brought forward a little bit.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then just the last one on the nice number of signings that you've got recently in Merchant. How should we think about those as far as the effect on pricing? Is it fair to assume that they have a little bit of a negative influence on pricing?
M. Scott Crocco: In general -- so just to be clear, we're always managing the price volume trade-off, right. In general, when we look at new opportunities, the price, depending on the subregions, might be a little lower than average and then you are able to work the price up over time. But let's just be clear. We're making sure that we are managing that combination, we're not dropping price simply to be able to load the facility.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Gulley with BGC Financial.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: I want to dig a little bit deeper with respect to the margin pressure in Merchant, which is your largest business so clearly that's maybe a source of concern. You've talked about the lag effect of formulaic passthrough of input cost. Is that going to persist for a while or should we anticipate a catching up effect where you can get genuine margin improvement because of the incremental leverage you've already addressed?
John E. McGlade: So we need to obviously drive the margin up in Merchant. That's our #1 priority. And that's going to be a combination of loading, as you noted. And as Scott mentioned earlier, as we would see pricing, I'm sorry, loading in the market begin to cross the 80% at a local level, you have an opportunity I think to get more real pricing increases. And frankly, to your point, there is a lag effect. That lag effect is more pronounced when you have a big step function change in those inputs. And over the last several months, I think we could see where natural gas has gone, where diesel has gone and we've got to work that. But the team understands that they've got to work that and we're out doing that day in and day out.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: Secondly, I wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the Tonnage thing. You talked about customer outages particularly, as Scott referenced, the larger pipeline network of hydrogen. Is it possible that as the crudes slate get lighter and sweeter, customers have less need for hydrogen so they might call it an outage, that they've taken a unit down for HDS or whatever but in fact, just because they've changed their crude slate?
John E. McGlade: No, these are -- I appreciate the point, but these are really truly outages that turn around. This is very common part of the year where you go from home heating oils to transportation fuels in calendar quarter 1 and part of calendar quarter 2 as you start for the summer driving season, so to speak. The other point I'd make is on the whole light sweet crude thing, we've looked at that. And we've looked at that so many different ways, and we don't really see a material impact to our business. The other thing that you got to keep in mind is the refineries in the Gulf Coast that can use the heaviest, sturdiest crudes, they're going to tend to run those with a lot of that lighter, sweeter crude predominantly going into those refineries that haven't made the investment to be able to use the more challenged crudes. The other point that I think we got to keep in mind is when refining the amount of power and steam and hydrogen that goes in to refine a barrel of oil in the United States comes from a very advantaged natural gas price versus sort of the rest of the globe where you've got to create that energy and that hydrogen and that theme from $100 a barrel of oil or $90 a barrel of oil. And so there's an implicit invested or capital advantage already, further leveraged by a nice operating cost advantage on the spread between natural gas and oil.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: I appreciate that, John. If I could just wrap up. I know you listen to all your shareholders, but I'm thinking you listen maybe a little bit more carefully to your largest holder. Can you kind of update us on the kind of input you received from that shareholder and how you're kind of thinking about some of the things you've talked about?
John E. McGlade: So you hit the nail on the head. We do listen to the best of our ability to all of our shareholders. And to be quite honest, I would never disclose what one shareholder says to me versus another. I just don't think it'd be appropriate. However, those dialogues with any particular shareholder are all within the context of Reg FD. And each one of them has a little bit different view of how the business should be run, where we should invest, what we shouldn't do. But I think everybody has an aligned view of we need to improve our earnings, we need to improve our returns and I'm totally aligned with that as you've heard in this call and as you've heard from many of our calls and we're very focused on that.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So in thinking about your returns for the quarter, they're puzzling in that I think in response to Don's question you said, "Well, you know our Merchant incremental returns are 35%." And so absent the cost inflation you should have been up $13.5 million, but you were down a couple of million. So in Tonnage, you had these difficulties with contract terminations and turnarounds. Is the first half cost structure just tremendously, unusually high and that is the way that you can make your earnings guidance in the second half? Or can you quantify how unusually high the first and second quarter cost structure is?
M. Scott Crocco: Jeff, this is Scott. So maybe -- first of all, I wouldn't call the cost structure unusually high. But if we step back and think about the impact from the Tonnage outages, maybe in broad brush, kind of $0.05 or $0.06 from both the combination of higher maintenance expense that we saw as well as the impact from the volume. So the combination of those 2 are going to reduce the return. And again going forward, we expect to see continued outages and would see a step up from maintenance cost of another $0.03 or so going forward. And again, I'd reemphasize the other things going on in the portfolio, including PUI, which, accounting rules preclude us from putting in discontinued operations. But it's a wind down and, as Simon mentioned, we exited that business in December, but it's going to be a headwind both from a sales and from an earnings perspective. And so I think as we mentioned at the beginning of the year, PUI, I think we said about $0.10 headwind, really driven by the earnings that we saw last year and then having the full year impact in '14. Recognize we did have one quarter's worth of results here in this year.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is it looks like you're going to earn $2.70 in the first half and the low point of your guidance is $5.70, so you've got to earn $1.50 a quarter in the second half and going -- up $0.15 a quarter is about $45 million or $43 million in operating income. So how do you do that? How do you get such a big change in the second half?
M. Scott Crocco: So as I mentioned, so we've got the impact from our signings. We recognize the economy is going to be a factor, but what we've seen so far this year is consistent with our original guidance. You couple that economic environment with the signings and bringing those signings onstream. And I think you can see in the Merchant results from the loading perspective. We've seen those impacts. We also then, through the year, we're going to see the impact from the provision actions that we announced last quarter. And again that's broad brush across the Merchant business as well as restructuring actions we're taking inside of the Electronics business, as well as some corporate functions and then focus on bringing onstream the projects that are in backlog, good, profitable projects that when they come on will be accretive to earnings, return on capital, cash flow.
Simon R. Moore: We'll take one more question.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. I guess this is just a follow-up. In the last quarter, you gave some very specific bridge guidance from last year to this year. It sounds like you're still expecting the $0.20 to $0.25 from new plants and you're not going to make a call on FX rates, but is everything else the same, principally the base business $0.05 to $0.15 and the cost being plus 15 and any of those other items, has anything changed?
M. Scott Crocco: No, Vincent. This is Scott. No change from the -- for both from the guidance as well as the walk that we gave for you this day.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then quickly, just do you have -- do you know offhand what your ROCE would be x Indura sort of on the same-store sales basis?
M. Scott Crocco: Roughly, the impact from Indura would maybe be 50, 70 basis points, something on that nature.
John E. McGlade: Let me just wrap up by saying our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering and our future prospects are strong given our record project backlog and the significant leverage we have on our existing assets. I, and the whole team, thank you for joining us today. And have a great and safe day. Thank you, Whitney.
Operator: This now concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Air Products' fourth quarter results teleconference. This is Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO. John will make a few opening remarks and summarize our results. Scott will provide more detail on our quarterly and fiscal year results and update our outlook for 2014, and I will provide perspective on each of our key operating segments. After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We issued our earnings release this morning. It's available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, are also available on our website. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides, and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.
John E. McGlade: Thank you, Simon, and let me also wish everyone a good morning. We greatly appreciate you joining us on the call today. I want to start off by providing you with my perspective on our fiscal year. In 2013, Air Products delivered on our key priorities: cost reduction, productivity improvements, disciplined project execution and portfolio management. While the economy was weaker than expected, our volumes improved, and our productivity initiatives more than offset inflation. All of this produced clear benefits for our shareholders. As you can see on Slide 3, we had a solid year. We grew sales by 6%, and our underlying volumes x PUI grew by 1%. We grew both operating income and EPS by 2% each, short of expectations at the beginning of the year but consistent with our recent guidance. We increased the dividend by 11%, making this the 31st consecutive year of dividend increases by Air Products. And we also bought back 5.7 million shares during the year at an average price of just under $81 or a 24% discount to our year-end closing price. Overall, we have returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks since 2008, and we delivered a total shareholder return of 33% for the year, well in excess of the S&P 500 DSR of 19%. In addition, we continue to make significant progress with our portfolio and productivity actions. We delivered cost savings of $60 million from our 2012 European focus reorganization, both on time and on budget. And we are taking additional actions aimed at reducing cost by a further $75 million, up from our target of $60 million in new savings that we discussed on our Q3 earnings call. These actions, which include product exits and asset rationalizations, as well as organizational improvements, are focused on strengthening our electronics business, particularly focused on products that serve the LED and photovoltaic, or PV, markets. In addition, we are restructuring our global operation functions and further optimizing our European cost structure. We delivered solid cost performance and productivity, and our SG&A to sales of 10.5% remains the best in the industry. And we are on track to exit the remainder of our Polyurethane Intermediates, or PUI, business in the next several months as we satisfy our final contract obligations. We delivered on our commitments to our customers and shareholders by executing on our backlog of projects safely, on time, on budget and at returns that are well above our cost of capital. We brought on stream more than a dozen major new projects, including hydrogen plants and air separation plants in the United States, Europe and China. These investments are backed by long-term, take-or-pay contracts, and will drive cash flow and earnings growth in the future. And we successfully integrated the Indura acquisition in South America, strengthening our position in this fast-growing market. Now please turn to Slide 4. On the new business side, we had a very successful year winning new and profitable projects. We continue to see exciting growth in the oxygen for coal gasification market in China, the hydrogen market globally and the LNG market around the world. And finally, our energy-from-waste business in the Tees Valley 1 project are going very well. I visited the site earlier this year and I was very impressed. We are on schedule, on budget and meeting our safety goals. We remain confident in the business strategy I shared with you when we announced the first Tees Valley project, including the proven on-site business model supported by long-term contracts with firm prices, we do not take the price of volume risk for any of the inputs or outputs of the plant, a clear and compelling market need in the U.K. to reduce waste and create clean and renewable energy, and we have proven expertise in every unit of operation: oxygen production, gasification, syngas clean-up and power generation. With that, we have decided to proceed with the second facility adjacent to the Tees Valley 1 project. The schedule will be optimized to take advantage of project synergies and the Renewable Obligation Credit, or ROC, program. Simon will provide more details, but as a result, we expect Tees Valley 2 to be more profitable than Tees Valley 1. Before I conclude, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to delivering on our priorities for 2014. These priorities have not changed. We are focused on executing against our backlog, winning profitable new projects, loading existing assets and implementing further productivity and cost initiatives. The investments we have made over the past several years and our ability to adapt to changing economic conditions are key drivers for Air Products' future. We believe shareholders will realize increasingly stronger returns as earnings growth from the profitable projects in our backlog contribute in 2014 and accelerate significantly in 2015 and 2016. Now let me turn the call over to Scott.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 5 for a review of our 2013 results. Sales of $10.2 billion increased 6%, with acquisitions contributing 5% and higher energy pass-through contributing 2%. Our underlying sales were 1% higher on strength in our North American and Asian Tonnage businesses, higher Performance Materials volumes and LNG equipment orders. These were partially offset by weakness in our electronics equipment area. The impact of our wind-down of our PUI business was unfavorable by 2%. Overall volume growth was more modest than we had expected. While this is primarily due to weak macro economic environment, particularly in Europe and Asia, we remain focused on loading our existing assets. Our operating income and earnings per share were both up 2%, while our operating margin for the year was 15.4%, down 60 basis points, primarily due to higher pension costs. Our return on capital employed, or ROCE, declined by 140 basis points to 10.1% as a result of higher capital spending, including the Indura acquisition. This is well above our 8% cost of capital. As a reminder, we are developing, executing and operating good projects that are accretive to ROCE over the next few years. Turning to Slide 6, let me now take you through our fiscal Q4 results. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 1% lower than prior year on lower volumes and stable pricing, partially offset by higher energy pass-through and currency. Sequentially, overall sales increased 2% on a 3% stronger volumes across all business segments. Operating income of $421 million increased 3% versus prior year and 10% sequentially. Our operating margin of 16.3% was up 60 basis points versus prior year, despite higher pension costs. Sequentially, our margin improved 130 basis points, primarily due to higher volumes and lower costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were up 3% and 4%, respectively, versus last year. Turning to Slide 7, you can see an overview of the factors that affected this quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. The non-GAAP items include the cost reduction program John mentioned, a charge of $232 million before tax, $158 million after-tax, or about $0.74 per share. We expect to see annual benefits of about $75 million beginning in fiscal 2015. The fiscal '14, benefits we expect to see are about $45 million or $0.15 per share. This charge includes $141 million for actions within our electronics process materials business. The charge includes the final contract settlement and exit from the silane business, a restructuring of our NF3 and ammonia positions in the U.S. and a number of headcount reductions. The lack of growth in the PV market overall and the collapse of the thin-film PV sector specifically led to overcapacity in both NF3 and silane. As you can see, we have taken decisive actions to exit the silane business, where we were not a basic manufacturer, and to optimize our NF3 capacity by reducing production in the U.S. The LED market also suffers from overcapacity and we have reduced our U.S. ammonia production accordingly. To be clear, the rest of the electronics portfolio continues to deliver value, and we are comfortable with its place on our portfolio. The on-site business is stable and grows as we renew nitrogen plant orders for new fabs. And the advanced materials business is driven by new product development as it is focused on providing solutions for customers' advanced node manufacturing. We believe the strength of our on-site, advanced materials and delivery systems businesses, combined with the positive impact of these decisive actions, positions our electronics business for continual profitable growth in the future. The charge also includes $61 million of other costs, including further restructuring of our European Merchant organization, rightsizing our Asian Merchant organization for the expected slower growth environment, restructuring our global operations team and the elimination of additional administrative costs. Finally, there's an additional $30 million of other asset actions within the Merchant and Tonnage businesses for the shutdown of underutilized facilities. Also included in this quarter's non-GAAP items is $0.03 of costs for advisory services. In discontinued operations, we had a $0.06 impact from lower expected proceeds for the divestiture of the U.K./Ireland Homecare business that we are continually actively marketing. As a reminder, we recorded a $0.70 per share gain in the third quarter fiscal '12 when we completed the sale of the larger continental Homecare business. Excluding these items, our continuing operations EPS of $1.47 increased by $0.05 or 4% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.08, with each business segment up year-on-year. The positive impact on profits was driven by mix, primarily the impact of less lower margin sale of Equipment business. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.04, due primarily to the higher raw material costs in Merchant and Electronics and Performance businesses and lower pricing in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. Net cost performance was flat, including a $0.05 unfavorable pension impact. Our productivity efforts more than offset inflation. Excluded from the volume and cost lines is a net $0.01 unfavorable impact from our decision to exit the PUI business. This is a smaller impact than last quarter due to our asset management efforts. Currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.01 favorable. Equity affiliate income contributed $0.01. Noncontrolling interest was $0.03 unfavorable, primarily due to stronger Indura results. Lower interest expense, tax rate and shares outstanding each contributed $0.01. And overall, we delivered a good quarter on solid execution and cost performance. Now for a review of the business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 8, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of over $1 billion were up 4% versus last year, driven by 3% stronger volumes and 1% improved pricing. Liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes were up again in all regions, partially offset by lower helium volumes globally due to the supply challenges and packaged gases demand weakness in Europe. Sales were up 2% sequentially on stronger volumes and flat pricing. Volumes were stronger in U.S., Canada and Asia, while Europe saw the normal seasonal summer slowdown. Helium volume was below our expectations and was again down versus prior year, driven by reduced availability from our helium feedstock suppliers in the U.S. and Algeria. It was certainly positive that an agreement was reached to avoid shutdown of the U.S. government helium supply. However, we expect helium to remain relatively tight over the next few years until some of the longer-term sources we are developing come on stream. We do expect modest sequential improvement through next year as we begin to get product from our Wyoming facility late in Q1 and additional Middle Eastern supply helps the industry. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to actively develop new sources. We announced yesterday a new project to extract helium from a Kinder Morgan facility already in operation in Doe Canyon, Colorado. This new facility is expected to produce 230 million standard cubic feet per year of pure helium, replacing more than 15% of the BLM supply as that system declines. We expect the new facility on stream in early 2015. Globally, for the full year, contract signings continued to be strong, up double digits from last year's record level. In addition, customer retention improved significantly. Merchant Gases operating income of $177 million was up 10% versus prior year and up 7% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.7% was up 90 basis points compared to last year and up 70 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on the higher volumes, improved pricing, particularly in U.S./Canada and lower costs, particularly in Europe, from last year's cost reduction program. Sequentially, operating income was up on higher volumes and lower costs. Let's now review the Merchant business by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In U.S./Canada, sales were up 12% on 7% higher volumes and 5% higher pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were again up 5% on strength in the oilfield services, food, metals and petrochemical markets as we continue to see positive contributions from last year's strong contract signings. Liquid argon volumes were also up on strong demand, and we saw a positive volume contribution from the EPCO acquisition, but helium volumes were down due to supply limitations. LOX/LIN capacity utilization is up slightly to the mid-70s. Overall pricing was positive, primarily driven by helium. LOX/LIN prices were slightly positive, reflecting our price increase and recovery of higher power costs. We announced a new West Texas liquid nitrogen facility to support the Oilfield Services business in the Permian Basin. We expect this facility to deliver solid profitability when on stream in 2015 as a result of the expected strong Oilfield Services demand growth. In 2012, we started up a similar facility in Oklahoma for this market, and it has more than exceeded our expectations. These targeted capacity additions are great investments. In Europe, sales were up 1% versus last year on 2% lower volumes, flat pricing and a 3% increase from currency. LOX/LIN volumes were flat versus prior year, with some strength in Central and Southern Europe. Argon and CO2 volumes were up, while helium volumes were down on supply constraints. Cylinder volumes were down on lower demand across the region. Overall pricing was flat with positive helium pricing offsetting negative LOX/LIN pricing, and LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the mid-70s. In Asia, sales were up 5% versus last year on 7% higher volumes, 3% lower prices and a positive 1% currency impact. LOX/LIN volumes were up double digits across the region and in China. Liquid argon volumes and our Microbulk product lines showed significant improvements, while helium was down on supply limitations and cylinder volumes were down slightly on customer profitability actions. Plant loadings remained in the mid-70s with moderate capacity additions. Pricing was down in the liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon business, particularly in China, driven in part by the wholesale market. Latin America is an increasingly important part of our global portfolio and a significant emerging market opportunity. With the acquisition of Indura 1 year ago, we believe it is important to begin to provide a Latin America regional commentary. As a reminder, Air Products has a wholly owned business in Brazil; a majority-owned business, Indura; and an equity affiliate joint venture in Mexico. So our sales and operating income commentary won't include Mexico as their results are included in equity affiliate income. Underlying sales were up 1% on flat volumes and 1% higher prices. There was a negative 5% impact from currency. Brazil volumes were flat overall, with some LOX/LIN growth offset by cylinder weakness. We brought onstream a new liquid plant in São Paulo that is providing significant productivity benefits. Indura volumes were flat with delays and mining projects in Chile and economic weakness in Colombia and Argentina. The LOX/LIN plant capacity utilization is in the mid-70s. After our first year of the Indura acquisition, we remain pleased with the team and the business. The integration has gone well. We've exceeded our expectations for synergies and are seeing more new Merchant liquid and small on-site opportunities than we had anticipated, a real credit to the combined Air Products and Indura teams. Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $835 million were down 1% versus last year on higher energy pass-through, offset by lower PUI volumes. Volumes x PUI were down 1%, as strong U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes continued but were offset by a contract termination in Latin America. We are particularly pleased to see continued strong U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen volumes leveraging our pipeline system. The exit of our PUI business by January 2014 is proceeding as we expected. For the quarter, PUI sales were down about $55 million versus prior year, and operating income was down modestly as we continued to reduce the remaining cost structure of that business. For the full year, as expected, PUI sales were down about $160 million, and operating income was down about $25 million. For the segment, sequential sales were down 1% on higher volumes, offset by lower energy pass-through. Operating income of $135 million was down 4% versus prior year and down 2% x PUI as we saw higher maintenance costs due to more customer-planned outages, higher pension costs and the impact of the contract termination. For the Tonnage business, our maintenance cost timing is primarily driven by the timing of our customers' planned outages. Obviously, it's beneficial to take our hydrogen plants offline for maintenance at the same time our customer has reduced demands due to their maintenance activities. With more planned customer outages in FY '14, we do expect an increase in costs before we return to more typical and lower levels in FY '15. Operating income was up 12% sequentially. X PUI, operating income was up 9%, primarily on the higher volumes. Operating margin of 16.1% was down 60 basis points versus prior year on a lower operating income and higher energy cost pass-through. Margin was up 190 basis points sequentially on the higher operating income and lower energy cost pass-through. As we said last quarter, we continue to see strong project development activity in the global hydrogen business, and we're pleased to recently announce 2 significant projects. First, we will build, own and operate an industrial gas complex to supply Bharat Petroleum's Kochi, India refinery and petrochemical complex. Air Products will be supplying 165 million standard cubic feet a day of hydrogen and steam from 2 steam methane reformers, syngas from our purification system, nitrogen and oxygen from an air separation unit, and we'll produce our own power from a gas turbine. As more regions focus on cleaner fuels and more customers see the value in outsourcing their industrial gases through the on-site model, we believe our leadership position in global hydrogen will continue to drive growth. We also announced that we will build, own and operate a new 150 million standard cubic feet a day hydrogen production unit to supply Shell Canada's Scotford facility near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This plant will also supply North West's Sturgeon refinery with approximately 25 million standard cubic feet a day and will be connected to our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline system, supplying customers throughout the region. We expect to continue to see growth opportunities as refiners and upgraders expand operations in Western Canada. Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $580 million were down 6% versus last year, with volumes down 5% and pricing down 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 3% due to higher volumes. Versus prior year, Electronics sales were down 15%, primarily driven by lower Equipment sales, both delivery systems and sales of equipment in the on-site business last year. Tonnage was up, and process materials was down, primarily due to our decision to exit the silane business. Electronics sales were up 4% sequentially on improvement in delivery systems in both process and advanced materials. Performance Materials sales were up 7% versus last year as we saw positive growth across all regions and all major product lines. Orders were strong, construction markets improved, while marine coatings continued to be weak. Europe was stronger on export-driven markets. Sequentially, PMD sales were flat, which is better than the typical seasonal reduction. Operating income of $96 million was up 12% versus prior year, primarily due to an inventory revaluation last year. Operating margin was up 270 basis points to 16.5% on the higher operating income. Sequentially, operating income was up 10%, and operating margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to the higher electronics materials volumes Now please turn to Slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $118 million were down 7% versus prior year as lower ASU activity was only partially offset by higher LNG activity and up 14% sequentially on higher LNG activity. Operating income of $21 million was up 16% over prior year and up 28% sequentially, primarily on the higher LNG activity. As we said before, margins are higher on LNG projects than on ASU projects, so product mix impacts the results. The backlog of $402 million is down 11% from last year and up 23% versus last quarter, as we continued to see the sequential benefits of new LNG orders. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce a mid-scale LNG order for Technip in ShaanXi, China, reinforcing our commitment to supply all spectrums of the LNG market. In addition to this exciting order, the engineering and manufacturing activity, in support of our LNG business, remains at a high level and the outlook for the next several years is very promising. We expect to have a number of additional project award announcements soon. Air Products liquefaction technology has been selected for several of the LNG export projects being planned for North America. As these projects progress to the necessary licensing and permitting processes, we expect that one or more will reach final investment decisions in FY '14 and '15, resulting in firm equipment orders for Air Products. These projects are in addition to the Dominion Cove Point order, which was announced in April of 2013. Meanwhile, work is continuing on the 2 major floating LNG projects that we have in-house for Shell and PETRONAS, and we see continued opportunities in this market. In support of this increased activity, our second coil-wound heat exchanger manufacturing facility under construction in Florida will be coming online early in 2014, just in time to meet expected market demand. As John mentioned, we are excited about the progress in our Tees Valley 1 energy-from-waste project and the decision to proceed with the Tees Valley 2 project at the same site. Tees Valley 1 is on budget, meeting our safety goals, and on schedule to begin commissioning in late FY '14, and we expect the plant to be fully onstream in early FY '15. The Tees Valley 2 schedule is optimized to take advantage of project execution and startup synergies, with startup expected in early 2016. The schedule will also allow us to take full advantage of the Renewable Obligation Credit, or ROC, program. We've already secured the key contracts for waste and ROC sales with the same partners at Tees Valley 1, and we're pleased that the U.K. government cabinet office will purchase all the power from Tees Valley 2 under a similar long-term committed price contract. As a result of the project synergies, the capital cost is roughly 10% lower than Tees Valley 1, and we expect Tees Valley 2 to be more profitable than Tees Valley 1. The 2 projects combined also have very strong asset management opportunities. We're very proud of these projects and the Air Products innovation and expertise that are bringing them to life. These plants offer efficient, clean generation of power from waste. Together, these 2 facilities will create 1,500 construction jobs and 100 permanent jobs, divert as much as 700,000 metric tons of nonrecyclable waste from landfills each year and power as many as 100,000 homes. Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 13, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Economic activity in the second half of 2013 was slower than we had initially anticipated in most regions. Given the current economic conditions, we are planning for economic growth to be modest again in 2014. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we are forecasting manufacturing growth of 2% to 4%. In the U.S., uncertainty in the economy remains despite the government restart. The combination of unresolved fiscal challenges, weak job growth, low consumer confidence and diminished global demand are likely to continue to act as a headwind on economic growth despite the positive drivers of lower energy costs and strength in housing. We are forecasting a range of 2% to 4% growth. However, even the low end of the range assumes no significant impact from any potential government shutdown or debt ceiling crisis. In Europe, challenges remain, with low confidence levels and weak job markets. We are hopeful that we've seen the bottom and anticipate growth of 0% to 2%. This is dependent upon trade-offs between austerity and growth reforms. In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration in manufacturing growth to continue, particularly in China. However, recent government focus on reform is expected to temper growth. For the region, we expect growth of 5% to 7%. In South America, we expect growth in the range of 1% to 3%. This is dependent on global economic demand driving the export market. We expect that Electronics will begin to rebound in 2014 after 2 years of weakness. Overall, for the year, we forecast square inches of silicon process to be up 3% to 5% next year. Our project development and contract signings continue to be very strong. As Simon mentioned earlier, we've recently announced 2 large hydrogen projects, one in India and one in Canada. You've heard us talk about the increasing demand for hydrogen around the world and increased acceptance of the outsource or sale of gas business model. This represents a great hydrogen opportunity for Air Products. We also continue to see opportunities in China for oxygen for coal gasification, driven by the government's goal of developing domestic sources of energy and feedstocks utilizing their vast coal reserves. And our LNG business leadership continues with new orders for floating projects, U.S. export terminals, midsized plans, as well as the traditional baseload projects. The new and profitable on-site projects would drive earnings in 2016 and beyond. Fiscal '14 capital spending is expected to be similar to the $2 billion level we saw in fiscal '13, although we are bidding a number of large and profitable investment opportunities. If a number of these move ahead, we could see our CapEx rise. Our continued success in winning profitable new projects has increased our backlog to $3.5 billion, securing additional future profitable growth. You can see an updated list of our major projects in Appendix Slide 17, along with the geographic and business segment capital spending split on Slide 18. Now to help you with historical comparisons, Slide 19 in the appendix shows non-GAAP CapEx, which includes capital lease expenditures. Given our economic outlook for fiscal 2014, our EPS guidance range is $5.70 to $5.90. Walking from our 2013 EPS of $5.50, we have the following factors. New plan onstream should add about $0.20 to $0.25. These are projects that are either onstream now or will be onstream soon and the on-site projects are backed by contractual commitments. This number is slightly below our previous expectations due to project timing and slower merchant floating ramps. We expect a greater contribution from new plants in FY '15 and FY '16. The base business should add $0.05 to $0.15 per share through a combination of higher volumes and increased LNG business. The higher volumes in Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials will be the factor most influenced by the economy. Higher maintenance costs will be about a $0.05 headwind as a significant number of our hydrogen customers have scheduled outages next year. Our cost reduction efforts should add about $0.15 a share. The shutdown of our PUI business could be a $0.10 headwind. Pension expense will be about a $0.05 tailwind as the rise -- due to the rise of interest rates. We expect taxes, currency and interest costs to be roughly flat to last year. And the number of shares outstanding will increase modestly, resulting in about a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. Now let's turn to our first quarter outlook in Slide 14. Our guidance for Q1 is for earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.35 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new planned onstreams, further progress of our cost reduction initiatives and lower pension costs. Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials we expect to see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to seasonally higher maintenance spending and lower volumes as refineries begin taking their annual outages. We will see lower Equipment and Energy profits in the first quarter based on project timing, although we do expect a significant rebound to the rest of the year. Finally, we expect to see an adverse impact from inventory revaluation and lower OIE. Now let me turn the call back to John to wrap up.
John E. McGlade: Thank you, Scott. Please turn to Slide 15. In conclusion, our performance this quarter was driven by our ability to execute effectively on the strategic priorities we set out at the beginning of this year. We continue to stay focused on driving our global competitiveness and improvement in our overall returns and profitability. Moving into fiscal year 2014, the leadership team and I, with the full support of the board, will continue to move forward aggressively on the priorities we have outlined for our investors, customers and other stakeholders: continued cost reduction and productivity improvement; disciplined project execution; loading of our existing assets; and winning new projects, creating profitable growth to drive shareholder value into the future. And while we do not expect to see some continuing -- while we do expect to see some continuing economic headwinds in fiscal year '14, we also see great opportunities for good projects at attractive returns in our core hydrogen, oxygen for coal gasification, electronics and LNG leadership positions. Before we turn it over for questions, let me also take this opportunity to welcome the new directors we've recently added to our board: Seifi Ghasemi, Edward Monser and Matthew Paull. The management team and I have met with each of them as part of their onboarding process, and we look forward to the insights these 3 highly qualified individuals bring to Air Products as we work to continue to create value for our shareholders. In addition, as you all know, I've announced my retirement in 2014, after 38 great years with the company. It's something the board and I have been discussing for some time now as I approach 60 years old. To ensure we find the most qualified CEO candidate, we have formed a search committee and retained a global search firm. Our goal is to have our new CEO in place in the first half of 2014. And with that, thank you. And now we are ready to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Scott, you mentioned that the impact from new plants will also be higher in '15, '16, and '14? Could it be a double the $0.25 number you put out there for '14?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes, David, so if you look at the projects that are in our backlog, I think the impact that we're going to see in '14 moving forward, you could see that doubling in '15 and even higher in '16, again, for those projects that are currently in our backlog. So good ramp-up as we bring those projects onstream. And as a reminder, over 85% of our projects in backlog are take-or-pay terms, so we don't have volume risks. So we feel confident about the growth in earnings, particularly in '15 and '16.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And Scott, I would have thought the base business could do more than a $0.05 to $0.15 in 2014, given the loading that you should get on your base business and in Electronics. What's limiting the growth in that base business next year or in 2014?
M. Scott Crocco: So we are in a current situation economically that there's a lot of uncertainty, right? And you heard my comments around each of the different geographies, recognizing that we've begun to see some modest sequential growth, but there's a lot of risk, there's a lot of uncertainty and there's weak confidence. So we are optimistic that we're going to be able to load the facilities, not only from the economy but also our applications. I also mentioned that in that $0.05 to $0.15 is all the base business. So we're driving productivity efforts to offset inflation, and we're trying to manage pricing and offsetting increases in a raw material situation.
Operator: Next we'll move to P.J. Juvekar at Citi.
John Hirt: It's actually John Hirt, filling in for P.J. today. In Electronics and Performance Materials, your operating margins were higher than they've been now for a couple of years. And if I recall, the low end of your 2015 margin target that you talked about in the past is 18% for that segment. Now that you've done some rightsizing, and it sounds like there's more in the pipeline, do you think you've done enough to get to that 18% number?
Simon R. Moore: So John, it's a good question. And obviously, we're very pleased by the improvement in the segment. As we pointed out relative to last year, that was driven by an inventory revaluation last year. But we have seen some sequential strength in the business. And when you look at the year-on-year sales numbers, particularly on Electronics, that's primarily a function of the Equipment business, which is really tied to new fab CapEx. So if you take a look at the on-site business in Electronics, it's doing well. If you take a look at the advanced materials part of Electronics, it's doing well. And you see the decisive actions we're taking to drive improvement in the process materials. At the same time, the Performance Materials part of the business is going well. We said we had good sales growth across all major product lines in all regions, driven by some of our new activity. So we're comfortable and confident that with the changes we're making in Electronics, that segment is positioned well to improve going forward and drive margins improvements.
John Hirt: Okay. And then on the restructuring, if you had to allocate the expected $45 million of benefits that you anticipate for 2014 to your segments, how much would you anticipate falling into Merchant, how much in Electronics and Performance Materials, and how much outside of those 2 segments?
Simon R. Moore: So, yes, it's a great question, John. If I could just follow up with that. So roughly speaking, I mean, in Electronics, we probably see -- I don't know, $10 million, $12 million, $14 million of the savings. Okay? And then the rest of the savings probably will be about 2/3 Merchant and 1/3 Tonnage.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: If I could just ask what your cash flow expectations are for '14, both maybe cash flow from operations and then ultimately free cash flow? And I'm just thinking I've seen that higher shares outstanding but I see the interest flat. And how much of those charges are cash-oriented? If you could just reconcile that would be helpful.
M. Scott Crocco: Yes. So this is Scott. So we'd just take a step back and talk briefly about '13. When we look at our cash flow from operations, short of $1.6 million. And then look at PP&E, equity affiliate acquisitions, we define cash flow from operations, less that as free cash flow, we're negative by roughly $200 million, recognizing that we've made a voluntary pension contribution at the beginning of the year for about $220 million. So absent that we're about scratch. I'll also point out that through the course of this year, each quarter we improved the cash flow from operations sequentially quarter-to-quarter, and we're going to continue to focus on that going forward from both loading our existing assets and bringing the projects in the backlog onstream. We would expect next year to be breakeven to probably positively slightly positive from a free cash flow perspective. And in terms of the provision, we've got a fair amount that was paid in this quarter associated with the final contract termination. The lion's share of the provision, though, from an asset perspective, is not going to be cash but rather just the people actions will be cash that we'll see next year.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just as a follow-up, on the cylinder demand in Europe, it sounds like the cylinders are starting to come back. Is that something -- could you give a line of sight on where we are? And is that something that sort of took place in this quarter and we shouldn't expect to continue going forward, or how should we be thinking about that?
Simon R. Moore: Yes, Vincent, I think it's really, if you do year-on-year comparisons, right, we're still seeing weakness in the cylinder business. But I think sequentially, as we've said last quarter, we think in general, we're seeing some bottoming and there could be some signs of things starting to improve, but that's something that we definitely want to see some more improvement on next year.
Operator: We'll move next to Don Carson at Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes, a question on Merchant loading in the U.S. John, what penalty do you think you'd undergo because of your lack of a cylinder business? I mean, what impact do you think that might have on your loading, and what efforts are you doing to try and offset that? I know you started a Minibulk effort. How successful has that been? Has that helped loading at all in the liquid business? And then just as a follow for Scott, you've outlined how you expect earnings to improve new projects in '15 to '16. How does return on capital unfold? What construction, what's going to be the change in construction progress from year end '13 to '14 and '15?
John E. McGlade: Okay, Don. This is John. Thanks for the questions. Let me take the first one. Certainly I'm not sure we've ever quantified it in the context of a percent. Obviously, if you don't have a packaged gas business, you miss certain parts of the market verticals. However, having said that, and I appreciate you acknowledging it, we've really ramped up our commitment in terms of sales resources, our commitment in terms of Microbulk product offerings, the EPCO acquisition and strong applications, and I believe the 5% or so LOX/LIN growth you're seeing really is a result of that activity. As we talked, when we started doing that, it takes a little while for these projects from the signings that you bring on to come onstream, but I think we're starting to see that in the P&L. And I actually feel pretty good about the progress that, that team has made. Scott?
M. Scott Crocco: Don, to your return on capital employed comment. So I think first about the backlog, say, last year from a SIP [ph] perspective, maybe it's $1 billion. We end this year maybe $1.3 billion. And given the size of the backlog going forward, maybe it's more like $1.5 billion or so in '14. I would see '14, FY '14, as kind of being roughly flat with '13 from an ROCE bottoming out during the course of the year and then turning and coming up and improving second half of '14 into '15 and '16, as we bring the projects on the backlog. And again, re-emphasize that over 80% of this is in take-or-pay terms, and so that doesn't have the volume.
Operator: And we'll move next to John McNulty at Crédit Suisse.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a couple of questions on the Tees project #2. I believe the first one was going to take $500 million of capital and should have been about $0.10 accretive. So is that the same level -- I know you talked about a 10% discount on the capital side. So should we be thinking about that as $450 million or is it going to be a bigger facility? How should we think about capital requirements for that? And then in terms of the synergies and the opportunities around that, that you mentioned, what does that mean for the EPS accretion?
John E. McGlade: So let me take this, John. So I think you have it captured correctly in terms of we see some execution synergies that will reduce the capital circa the $50 million or so that you mentioned. It also, as Simon mentioned in his words, it really gives us the opportunity, frankly, beyond the cost synergies to take the experienced team that's already executing 1, move them right to 2 and be able to take advantage of the Renewable Obligations Credits at their maximum levels that are out there today. The really exciting parts, though, of this project are the asset management opportunities that 1 offered us that when I mentioned that I was, in my words, that when I was at the site and reviewed with the team and if you just think of putting fundamentally a duplicate size and duplicate process facility next door, you just really get to leverage those up. So I think we would say in total the contribution, when both facilities are lined out, is on the order of $0.25 to $0.30 a share in EPS.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then with regard to the Merchant business, you've got -- you had some pretty decent volume growth, and yet you're still kind of looking at mid-70s utilization rates. I guess, I'm wondering if there's room for any rationalization of any of the existing capacity that you've got there, if that could potentially make sense going forward or not.
Simon R. Moore: Sure, John. I mean, one of the things that I believe I've said in a number of these calls is we always look at the opportunities for portfolio management, whether it be at a segment level or an asset level. And obviously, we're looking at that as we speak. I think, however, what you've got, you have to think about the loadings sort of from a regional perspective because there's different dynamics going on there. If I start in Asia, China largely, the turndown there came sort of as -- quite a bit of capacity was being added to the market in an environment where you had low double-digit growth, and now you've ratcheted that back 300 or 400 basis points. And so I'm pretty comfortable that we'll grow back into that capacity. It's just going to take a few years to do that. Europe, obviously, if the economics scenario we continue to look and ask ourselves where we are on that, and do we have the right assets. And as you've seen and heard, we've taken a lot of actions in Europe both in '13 and then are projecting some additional actions here in '14. In North America, those came down a little more by some of the targeted additions we've brought in. So we mentioned the Oklahoma facility that came into the map, if you will, so that's more of a mathematical issue that, again, I think would be signings that we're achieving in that marketplace, we'll get there. And if I go to Latin America and talk Brazil, specifically, we did bring on a new plant in Brazil that added some incremental capacity, although the primary reason for that was really to shut down a 35, 40-year-old asset, and there was significant productivity benefits from that. And right now, if you go to the sort of the Chile area, a lot of that is export-driven, which is tied to global economies. But I think we're pretty comfortable that, that'll come back on track as the global economies strengthen over the next year or so.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer at Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was wondering 2 things. The first is, if you just go to your Slide 13, where you go through the worldwide manufacturing growth numbers outlooks for next year, where did those come in on your calendar year or your fiscal year? Just so we know kind of what the delta is going forward for the next year if you walk through those for the last 12 months.
M. Scott Crocco: Sure, Duff. This is Scott. So low end of the range, overall, we would say that the global manufacturing growth came in roughly about 2%. Now inside of it, U.S./Canada would be at the low end, 2.2% or so. Asia came in about the middle of the range. Europe, being the big disappointment, that came in, call it, 2% negative, so well below the range. And then South America, likewise, is kind of at the low end of the anticipated range. So overall, the manufacturing environment that we saw was the low end, for some regions, particularly Europe below the low end. I'll also point out that from a square inches of silicon perspective, we anticipated in '13 growth of mid-single digits, call it, 4% to 6%. And while we're still looking at what the final numbers come in at on our fiscal year basis, it might be just modestly favorable but nowhere near where we had anticipated.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then if you walk back, you laid out about the same slide 1 year ago. Coming off a base of $5.40 in '12, you expected to grow midpoint $0.35 EPS during the last year. Now looking forward, do you expect to grow $0.30 off of $5.50 base over the next year. But when you look through your growth numbers, Asia and Europe are meaningfully better, and those are 2 very big markets for you as you're look forward over the next year. And probably more important, you put another $2 billion of capital in the ground, which should give you leverage. So I guess, I struggle to see why you would only expect to grow $0.30 over the next year when you expected to grow $0.35 if we go back 1 year over the future year. But yet, things seem to look better both from a macro perspective and certainly much larger from a capital base perspective.
M. Scott Crocco: All right. So if I step back and think about our view last year this time, we anticipated that each of the geographies had bottomed out and we're going to see sequential growth through the course of FY '13 with a particularly strong second half of the year in FY '13. We didn't see it. For each of the different geographies, we kind of saw the slow point, the low point of their manufacturing output sometime during FY 13. U.S., maybe the beginning of the summer. Europe, maybe late winter. And Asia, somewhere in that same timeframe. So from a momentum perspective, we're projecting going forward solid sequential growth, but again, recognizing there's a lot of uncertainty in the economy, but it's off of a lower base than what we had anticipated last year at this time. The other thing, again, that we are focused on are those things that we can control. So given the fact that the economy didn't play out, we delivered on the provision that we took last year, which, as you know, was more focused on Europe. And now, today, we've announced a larger provision that is focused on a variety of different areas, both from a portfolio perspective in Electronics, like we talked about, as well as supply chain, Europe, and then rightsizing in Asia as well. While we see growth in Asia, we have to make sure that we have the right level of resources given the economic environment that we're projecting. And then just lastly, around your comment around the investment that we put in the ground. We look back at the investment that we've made, and the issue is the loading of the merchant investments that we put in the ground compared to the long-term take-or-pay contacts that we have on the Tonnage side. So as we've said in the past, our focus is loading the investments that we've already made and bringing onstream those projects that are in backlog to make sure that we have profitable growth, not only in '14 but also '15 and '16.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Harrison at First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: Just a couple of questions related to the NF3 capacity rationalization. How much capacity is going to be taken out at the hometown plant? What portion of the total NF3 production does that represent? And are we just seeing some lower demand overall driving the overcapacity, or are you starting to see competition from increasing use of on-site fluoride?
Simon R. Moore: It's a good question, Mike. So first of all, we are really not seeing any penetration of on-site fluorine. That's being talked about in the industry for at least 10 year, and we have not seen any significant impact. As Scott mentioned, what has really driven the NF3 supply demand dynamics is the lack of expected growth from PV. That was expected to grow and use up a fair amount of NF3. It hasn't happened. So over the last year or so, you've been hearing us talk a little bit more about volume pressure and price pressure. So we've taken an action to rationalize some capacity in the U.S. We're still going to manufacture in the U.S. There are still demand for NF3 in the U.S., but we expect to take about 20% to 25% out of our NF3 global manufacturing footprint with these actions.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And then looking at the weakness in Asia Merchant pricing. Last quarter, you had noted some competitive pressures you saw. It looks like those may have intensified this quarter. Are those pressures showing any signs of easing? And are you guys working to increase the amount of Merchant sales under contract as opposed to selling through wholesalers in China?
Simon R. Moore: It's a great question, Mike. And really, I'm glad you've made that last point because that's a really interesting dynamic in China. That isn't as common in other regions for the Merchant business, and that's the presence of the wholesale market. So a couple of things here. First of all, existing Chinese on-site customers, who also build some liquid capacity, when they're running hard, particularly a steel mill, they'll use up all their own capacity and sometimes actually import some product. When they're not running so hard not only do they not import, but they can export as well. And you have a set of folks who play kind of a wholesale place in the supply chain there. So there is more volume/price dynamic in the wholesale market in China than we see -- there isn't a similar market in other regions. So we would not be surprised to see a little bit more volume/price changes as a result of the wholesale market. To answer the other part of your question, we absolutely are working hard and are increasing, if you will, the retail side of the business, but at the same time acknowledging the wholesale market is a good place to move product, particularly when assets are unloaded.
John E. McGlade: And I think this isn't too unusual if you think about the evolution of the various markets across the globe. The more mature markets have gone pretty much to the industry -- the customers who supply for the industry. You're going to have this mix for a while, but it's something I think we understand and absolutely something we'll be driving to the points that Simon made as it relates to how we contract and how we make investment decisions in that market going forward.
John Hirt: And just to get to the crux of the question though, are the competitive pressures easing and you're seeing some improvement in the pricing dynamics or not really?
John E. McGlade: I would say it continues to be a competitive market, Mike.
Operator: And we'll go next to Mike Sison of KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of, I just wanted to get your perspective. You have another year under your belt in thinking about this 20% operating margin goal that you have out there. Do you feel better about Air Products potentially getting there? Any structural reasons that hinder that potential longer term? And I'm not going to pin you on when, but when you think about that goal, is it still something that you think the company can get to?
John E. McGlade: Yes. Well, from my perspective, those goals were put at a time where we expected a much different economic environment. I think the important thing, though, for us to focus on is our return on capital employed. And as Scott mentioned earlier, we, when we begin to bring these new on-sites on and put it behind us given the stepped-up investment that we have, I see a way to continuing to improve our return on capital employed and moving towards one of the industry-leading return on capital employed numbers out there from a spread over our cost of capital. And so looking forward, if I look at our portfolio, if I look at how we position the business, the world sort of played out a little differently than we anticipated. But on the plus side, the opportunities in some of our leading marketplaces like tonnage and hydrogen and electronics have played out better.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And a quick follow-up, Scott, maybe on the new projects, the $0.20, $0.25. It sounds like maybe Merchant is going to be a bigger portion of that than we might have thought in the past as some of the tonnage got pushed out. Any thoughts on the split between the 2?
M. Scott Crocco: There's a lot of Tonnage in there. I mean, recognizing that as the backlog gets worked in, as we mentioned, previously the split was more evenly balanced Merchant and Tonnage, but recently the backlog has been over 80% -- 80%, 85%. And so it's a combination of both, but there's a heavy element of take-or-pay terms. And so we feel good about that volume growth projection from new assets into '14 as well as '15 and '16.
Simon R. Moore: John?
John E. McGlade: Yes. Let me just wrap up by saying, first, thanks to Audra, and then conclude with saying our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering. Our emphasis on cost reduction, productivity improvement and disciplined project execution remains key priorities. Our future prospects are strong given our record project backlog and a significant leverage in our existing assets. Please go to our website to access the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. And thank you for joining us and have a great and safe day.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.

Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon R. Moore: [Audio Gap] welcome to Air Products' third quarter earnings teleconference. This is Simon Moore. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO. After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, are also available on our website. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides, and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.
John E. McGlade: Thanks, Simon, and good morning. Before we take you through the details of the quarter, I would like to make a few comments. While we did see signs of improvement, the quarter generally continued the pattern of weak economic growth and a soft electronics market. Despite this, our earnings did come in above the midpoint of our range. Our underlying volumes were flat versus prior year, excluding the impact of our decision to exit the Polyurethane Intermediates business. As we said last quarter, we expect this slow growth environment to continue for some time. Most importantly, we continue to stay focused on actions within our control. Last year's European restructuring is complete and delivering the full $60 million per year run rate benefit we expected. The integration of our Indura acquisition is proceeding as planned. And while early, the initial results of our EPCO acquisition announced last quarter are encouraging. Through the quarter, we remain focused on execution and continue to drive improvement through cost discipline and productivity. Further, we are confident our $3 billion project backlog, which is over 80% on-site/pipeline business with long-term take-or-pay contract terms, will drive earnings growth into the future. In our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials businesses, we are taking proactive steps to continue to improve the performance of the business today, and we see significant opportunity when the economy improves to load our existing assets at high incremental margins. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we are actively assessing additional actions we can take that would result in improved margins and returns, and increase value to our shareholders. That process is ongoing, and we are making good progress. As a result of these new actions, we expect to take a charge of approximately $100 million to $150 million pretax, or $0.30 to $0.50 per share in our fiscal Q4, with savings beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year '14. Once fully implemented, we expect the savings to be of the same order of magnitude as the $60 million per year benefit we achieved through the actions announced in 2012. Our plan is focused on improving our cost position in those regions and businesses that are facing the greatest challenges from slower market growth. We will have more specifics to share with you about this on or before next quarter's earnings call. I want to be clear that these cost actions do not mean our assessment is completed. We are continuing to actively review additional opportunities available to us to further improve our operations and increase shareholder value, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. Finally, our cash priorities remain unchanged: invest in our businesses at returns that create increasing shareholder value; increase our dividend each year, which we've now done for 31 consecutive years; strive to maintain an A bond rating; and repurchase shares. Now let me turn the call over to Scott to review our results.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 3. As we look back at this past quarter, manufacturing growth was weaker than expected when we developed our prior guidance. As a result, while we did see a pickup in our volumes versus the previous quarter, the improvement was modest relative to the seasonal uptick we typically see in this quarter. Let me provide you a few comments around what we are seeing. In North America, we continue to experience modest growth as the economy decelerates due to the impacts of higher taxes from the fiscal cliff and sequestration spending cuts. In Europe, the economy is worse than we expected and continues to contract versus last year despite some weak sequential growth during the quarter. In Asia, China continues to grow below trend line as the new government policy is focused on reforms in addition to growth. And the slower growth in China and the developed markets is impacting other emerging economies in Asia and South America. The electronics industry has remained soft with new fab construction delays, and the outlook for silicon processing remains below last year. Non-residential construction did not pick up during the quarter as we had expected, and this has impacted our Performance Materials volumes. As I mentioned last quarter, the LOX/LIN pricing environment in Merchant has become more difficult due to softer volumes, particularly in Europe and Asia, thereby impacting our ability to completely recover variable cost increases. While pricing was stable in North America, we were not able to fully recover power cost increases. Despite these challenges, and as John mentioned, we did deliver EPS above the midpoint of the guidance we provided in April. Let me now take you through our overall results. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were 9% higher versus prior year, with acquisitions contributing 6% and energy and raw material pass-through adding 5%. On an underlying basis, sales were down 2% due to our previously announced decision to exit the Polyurethane Intermediates or PUI business. Excluding PUI, higher volumes in our Merchant Gases and Equipment businesses were offset by lower volumes in our Electronics business. Sequentially, overall sales increased 3%, primarily due to seasonally stronger volumes in our Merchant and Performance Materials businesses. Simon will provide additional segment and geographic detail shortly. Operating income of $383 million decreased 3% versus prior year and 2% sequentially. Our operating margin of 15% was down 200 basis points versus prior year due to higher pension costs, higher energy pass-through and the underrecovery of increased variable costs, primarily in the Merchant business. Each of these had about a 50-basis-point impact on margin. And consistent with past quarters, the Indura acquisition has about a 20-basis-point dilutive impact. Sequentially, our margin declined 70 basis point, primarily due to pension settlements and higher merchant costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were down 5% and 4%, respectively, versus last year. Our return on capital employed of 10.5% was lower due to an increase in our capital in part due to the Indura acquisition. Turning to Slide 4. You can see an overview of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.36 decreased by $0.05 or 4% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.10, including $0.06 from Indura. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.05, due primarily to higher power costs in our Merchant business. Net cost performance was $0.06 unfavorable, including a $0.05 unfavorable pension impact. Our productivity about offset inflation and higher planned maintenance. Excluded from the volume and cost lines is the net $0.04 unfavorable impact from our decision to exit the PUI business. We saw no impact from currency translation and foreign-exchange year-on-year. Equity affiliate income contributed $0.01, and noncontrolling interest was $0.01 greater due to the addition of Indura. Interest expense was $0.03 higher due to increased debt. Our tax rate was 24%, slightly lower than last year and contributed $0.01. And lastly, lower shares outstanding as a result of our $460 million share repurchase in Q1 contributed $0.02. Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases' sales of just over $1 billion were up 18% over last year, driven by stronger volumes and the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were up 2% on 2% higher volumes and flat pricing. Liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon volumes were up in all regions, partially offset by lower helium volumes due to supply challenges and packaged gases demand weakness in Europe. Sales were up 3% sequentially on 4% stronger volumes, flat pricing and a negative 1% impact from currency. Volumes were notably stronger in Asia, rebounding from the Lunar New Year slowdown in the prior quarter. Helium volume was below our expectations and was down versus prior year, driven by limited availability from our helium feedstock suppliers, particularly in the U.S. We expect helium to remain relatively tight over the next few years until some of the longer-term sources we are developing come on stream. We do expect a slight improvement in Q4 and more into FY '14 as we get product from our Wyoming facility and additional Middle Eastern supply helps the industry. We are also actively developing additional new sources and expect to make a specific announcement soon. Merchant Gases' operating income of $165 million was flat versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16% was down 280 basis points compared to last year and down 80 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on profit from the Indura acquisition and the higher volumes but was offset by higher pension costs and higher power costs that were not fully recovered with price increases. Sequentially, operating income was down on higher power, maintenance and other operating costs. Overall, the Indura business continues to operate well. We have delivered on the expected synergies with good cost performance, saw improved margins this quarter and are seeing growth opportunities in a variety of end markets. We announced the new plant and the expansion of a second plant earlier this quarter. As we expected and said in the past, given Indura's business mix, their margins are in the low double-digits. As a result, for the quarter, Indura negatively impacted segment margins by about 50 basis points. Margins were also negatively impacted by increased pension costs and higher power costs that were not recovered in the marketplace as pricing was flat overall. Let's review the Merchant business by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In U.S./Canada, sales were up 6% on 2% higher volumes and 4% higher pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were up 5% on strength in the oilfield services, metals processing and petrochemical markets. The strong LOX/LIN volume performance reflects the benefit of our recent robust contract signings coming onstream. Liquid argon volumes were also up, but helium volumes were down due to supply limitations. We had our best quarter so far this year for new contract signings, and lost business was below last year. LOX/LIN capacity utilization is in the low to mid-70s. Although, overall pricing was positive, this was primarily due to helium and the contractual recovery of higher natural gas prices in liquid hydrogen. LOX/LIN prices were down slightly, and given the increase in power costs, this had a negative effect on margin. We announced earlier this quarter the acquisition of EPCO, the largest independent liquid CO2 company in the U.S. Liquid CO2 is a great complement to the rest of our liquid bulk offerings and improves Air Products' supply to those customers who use multiple products in key markets such as food freezing, oilfield services, pharmaceutical and metal fabrication. The integration is going well. In Europe, sales were down 2% versus last year on 2% lower volumes and 1% lower pricing, partially offset by a 1% increase from currency. LOX/LIN volumes were slightly positive, helped by wholesale volumes, but underlying end-market demand remains weak, particularly in metals, glass and cement and food. Helium volumes were down on supply limitations, while cylinder volumes were down throughout Europe, particularly in Central and Southern Europe and U.K./Ireland. Overall pricing was down 1%, with positive helium pricing partially offsetting negative LOX/LIN pricing. The LOX/LIN price decline was driven by both lower price and the mix effect from the increased wholesale volumes. New contract signings were comparable to last year but down relative to the last few quarters, and LOX/LIN plant routings remain in the mid-70s. We have fully completed the cost savings program announced last year and are seeing the savings in the P&L. In Asia, sales were down 1% versus last year on flat volumes, 2% lower prices and a positive 1% currency impact. LOX/LIN volumes were up across the region and up mid-single digits in China, both x conversions. Liquid argon volumes showed improvement after a few quarters of weakness, and helium was down on supply limitations. Cylinder volume growth was moderated by customer profitability actions and conversions, and we continue to see good growth in our Microbulk product line. Pricing was down in the liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon business, particularly in China. Power costs were up, negatively impacting margins. Plant loadings remain in the mid-70s. Capacity additions will continue to impact loadings despite volume growth as we bring on projects under construction. And new contract signings were stronger than last quarter, which have been the best in years. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases' sales of $846 million were up 10% versus last year on higher energy pass-through, partially offset by lower PUI volumes. Base volumes are relatively flat as U.S. Gulf Coast customer maintenance outages and 2 steel customer outages offset fewer customer outages in Europe. The exit of our PUI business by January 2014 is proceeding as we expected. For the quarter, PUI sales were down about $50 million versus prior year, and operating income was down over $10 million. Our expectations for the full year haven't changed. We expect PUI sales to be down about $160 million and operating income to be down about $25 million. For the segment, sequential sales were up 5% on slightly higher volumes x PUI and higher energy pass-through. Operating income of $120 million was down 11% versus prior year. X PUI, operating income of $118 million was down 2% on higher planned outage maintenance costs. Operating income was down 3% sequentially. X PUI, operating income was flat as lower bonus payment timing was offset by lower overhead costs. Operating margin of 14.2% was down 330 basis points versus prior year and down 100 basis points sequentially on the lower operating income and higher energy cost pass-through. As we said last quarter, we continue to see strong project development activity in the global hydrogen business. Customers are making decisions, and we expect to have project announcements in the near future. Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $566 million were down 6% versus last year, with volumes down 5% and pricing down 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 3% on 4% higher volumes, partially offset by a negative 1% currency impact. Versus prior year, electronic sales were down 11% with significantly lower equipment sales and weaker processed materials, somewhat offset by new on-site projects. The lower equipment sales are due to the slowdown in new fab CapEx, but we do expect equipment sales to rebound next quarter. Processed materials was impacted by lower fab utilization, PV market weakness and competitive activity affecting both volume and price. Sales were up 1% sequentially, a modest increase, below our expectations based on historical seasonal patterns, with improved materials volume somewhat offset by the negative currency impact. Performance Materials' sales were down 1% versus last year as higher volumes were offset by lower prices. Autos and the U.S. housing market continue to be positive, while non-residential construction was weaker than we expected and marine coatings continue to be weak. Sequentially, PMD sales were up 5% on improvement across Asia, Europe and North America. However, this growth was below our expectations. Operating income of $87 million was down 4% versus prior year on the lower electronics volumes and the combination of lower prices and product mix in PMD. Operating margin was up 30 basis points to 15.3% on mix, primarily in the electronics equipment business. Sequentially, operating income was up 12%, and operating margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to the higher electronics materials and PMD volumes. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $104 million were up 9% versus prior year, primarily on higher LNG project activity and down 16% sequentially on lower LNG and ASU activity. Operating income of $16 million was up 63% over prior year on the higher LNG project activity and lower development spending. Operating income was down 22% versus prior quarter on the lower project activity. The backlog of $327 million is down 25% from last year and unchanged versus last quarter as new orders were modest. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce our first major LNG order in the U.S. for Dominion's Cove Point, Maryland LNG export terminal, designed to produce over 5 million tons per year of LNG when operational in 2017. LNG development activity remains strong, and we expect to have additional announcements soon. Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 10, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Given the weaker-than-expected conditions we saw in Q3, we remain cautious on our expectations for near-term economic growth. In the U.S., growth in manufacturing output is expected to come in at the low end of our range. Uncertainty in the economy remains and unresolved fiscal challenges and diminished global demand are likely to continue to impact the pace of the recovery. In Europe, FY '13 will show negative year-over-year growth in manufacturing, below our expectations. We are hopeful that we are approaching the bottom and anticipate sequential growth going forward. In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration in manufacturing growth to continue, particularly in China. However, the recent government focus in China on reform is expected to temper growth going forward. And in South America, we expect the year to be at the low end of our original expectations. Our backlog remains robust, about $3 billion including a few projects that have not yet been announced. We still see a number of opportunities in oxygen for coal gasification in China and in hydrogen projects around the world. CapEx is expected to be about $2 billion this year, consistent with our most recent guidance. For Q4, our EPS guidance is $1.44 to $1.50, based on the following factors: on the positive side, we expect to see improved sequential volumes in Merchant; higher volumes and lower maintenance and tonnage following a number of customer outages this past quarter; less of an impact from the PUI business; and Equipment and Energy results should show some sequential improvement as well. A partial offset is expected from a higher share count. This results in our full year EPS guidance range being $5.47 to $5.53, within the range we shared with you last quarter despite the slower economy. Now let me turn it back to John to wrap up.
John E. McGlade: Thanks, Scott. We delivered earnings results within our commitments for the quarter despite the more modest economic activity. This earnings performance is a result of us taking decisive actions to manage what is within our control, with a particular focus on reducing costs, driving productivity and disciplined project execution. As I said earlier, we are actively assessing additional actions we can take that would result in improved margins and returns and increase value to our shareholders. The process is ongoing. We are making good progress and as a result, expect to take a charge in our fiscal Q4. Our plan is focused on improving our cost position in those regions and businesses that are facing the greatest challenges from slower market growth. We will have more specifics to share with you about this on or before next quarter's earnings call. And we continue to actively review additional opportunities available to us to further improve our operations and increase shareholder value. I believe our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering. We are executing well on our strong backlog of projects that will drive earnings and cash flow growth as they come online. We have significant leverage in our existing assets that leaves us well positioned for a recovery, and we remain focused on productivity, improving our core businesses and delivering on our cash priorities. Thank you. And now we are happy to turn your questions -- turn to your questions. Jessica?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. One, power costs continue to be an issue you guys talk about. And I'm just curious, is there anything that's changed about the time it takes you to get through power increases? And what regions did you see the greatest inflation in power?
Simon R. Moore: Yes, Bob, good question. So certainly, there, you are acknowledging that there is a lag delay in recovering the power costs, and I think we really saw the power cost impact. We saw it primarily in North America, certainly with the increase in natural gas costs and that significantly impacting power costs, where gas is on the margin for power producers. We also saw increased power costs in Asia. And I guess it's important to note that we did see these power costs increase. At the same time, while we wouldn't have been expecting to recover all of that in price this quarter, we are also seeing some pressure on the liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen pricing as well.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then would there be a similar benefit from the natural gas in your Tonnage business? I know when the business was struggling, that was certainly a factor in margin compression. So have you not seen any symmetric benefit as gas has gone back up here to the $3.70 range?
Simon R. Moore: No, Bob. We've seen it -- and consistent with the rough rules of thumb we shared, both in terms of the impact on sales and operating income, we have seen that in the Tonnage business.
Operator: We'll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just to get on the LOX/LIN pricing pressure, anything changed, fundamentals in the market in terms of increasing competitive intensity that's coming forth right now?
Simon R. Moore: So I think if we're talking about -- I made a comment on the LOX/LIN pricing. Perhaps -- John, you want to comment on kind of the broader competitive dynamic, particularly on the big projects?
John E. McGlade: Certainly, on the larger projects that -- we still see very, very good bidding activity. We've been quite successful. We mentioned the fact that we've had about a $3 billion project backlog when you consider projects that are in execution and a few that we'll announce shortly. In my mind, in this business, it's always been about where you have your skills, your competitive differentiation. And to be clear, and I think I've said this many times, there's no strategic project when you're making a $100 million bet or more on a long-term take-or-pay contract. You really have to earn the return expectations that are accretive to the strategy of the business and the corporation or you don't take it.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just lastly, on China, given the slowing growth in that region, have you seen any slowing of bidding activity in that region on new projects?
John E. McGlade: Yes, David, a couple of points. Really, China is really a tale about 2 stories right now in the context of the slowing Merchant business, although, as Simon noted, it's starting to improve a little, is really a function of decisions made in China to slow down the sort of manufacturing-driven economy in favor of urbanization, in favor of consumer opportunities, et cetera. The projects that we're pursuing -- and the answer specifically to your question is we have not seen a slowdown once the new government had gotten in place. For a couple of quarters there, as the government transition was happening, projects weren't getting approved at the national or the provincial level until they understood where the new government is. But frankly, the policies of the new government, whether they'd be around the energy policy of self-sufficiency, around energy and feedstocks or environmental policies, has really put a pretty strong focus on opportunity. And so we see the bidding continuing at levels now that it was, say, before the government changed. And one of the hidden opportunities in this new government's focus, frankly, is their real drive to stronger environmental standards, particularly around transportation fuels in and around the large urban cities, we believe is going to start generating a hydrogen opportunity that's kind of a new opportunity in China. We're executing a couple of hydrogen plants as we speak there, but we see more of that opportunity coming.
Operator: We'll go next to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes, 2 questions, John, on these additional actions you're taking to enhance the margin. Is this just going to be cost-driven? Are there any further portfolio moves like your exit from PUI? And then secondly, can you just give us the progression of the backlog? What projects are starting up in the next 3 to 6 months? And I know in the past you'd talked about a $0.20, $0.25 EPS benefit from new projects this year. Is that still the number? And what would you expect that number to be in fiscal '14?
John E. McGlade: Yes, Don. Let me take the first part and I'll look to Scott on the second part, if you don't mind. Look, what we're looking at is really overhead and asset, but not business, adjustments to really reflect sort of our current and future view of where the economic growth of the world is going. I think in the last call, I was pretty clear that we like our portfolio as it is. I think good companies continually do assessments of their portfolios, asking the questions around, "Are you the high-value owner or not?" And as I sit here today, I'll go back to my comments last quarter and my comments a moment ago that I like the quality of the portfolio we have, but that we will continue to focus to improve the underlying margins and returns of those assets.
M. Scott Crocco: In terms of your second question, Don, this is Scott, the $0.25 we would expect to see for FY '13 is still our number. Recognize that there's been some adjustments in terms of the timing. We have not seen any project cancellations. Obviously, with large projects, delays are not uncommon. But for the year, we would expect to see earnings per share year-on-year growth of $0.25 from new projects coming onstream. And while we haven't yet developed our guidance for next year, as we work through the backlog, we would expect a commensurate amount next year as well as we bring onstream those projects in backlog.
Operator: We'll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: John, you guys have been aggressive in bidding for coal-to-gas projects in China. These are much bigger ASUs so presumably, risk is much higher as well. So how do you make sure you have the right customers? And can you cite the risk for us on these projects?
John E. McGlade: Sure. That's a great question, P.J. And maybe if I go back to when I was in the Tonnage business here in the early 90s and we began looking at hydrogen for refineries, you got a similar set of questions. And the way we looked at that in terms of our own view of risk was really to do pretty robust assessments of the economics of that particular refinery in that case, or this particular gasification project in China. And what I'm really trying to say is will that project, one, with the economics that meet the needs of the energy costs or the feedstock costs that they're producing as opposed to who the ownership of that project is. And the reason we started doing that, if you will, back in the hydrogen days, is you were having a lot of refineries bought by unknown entities. They weren't multinational oil companies operating them anymore. So it's really critical to get an assessment of that project's economics in the context of the marketplace that they operate in. We do the same on these projects in China. And frankly, we've passed on quite a number of them, where we didn't even place bids if we didn't feel either the end product they were going into. So the end products ranged from methanol to synthetic natural gas to chemical building blocks, and we've passed on frankly a lot of the projects that we're in, in areas that we felt, long-term, the economics weren't sustainable. Many of the projects -- most of the projects that we're involved in now and most of the new projects are really in the coal to liquids and the synthetic natural gas, and the economics, the scale, we believe, are competitive with alternative energy sources or feedstock sources in China. But rest assured, it's a question that I ask the team long before we've submitted a bid as to whether or not we should deploy our resources on a particular project. We do earn, as we've talked many times before, higher risk-adjusted returns because of the nature of cost of debt and equity and country risk factors and all of the things that you would expect when you're not operating in other geographies. As you know, we adjust that by the geographies we operate in, and we do ensure that we get a high-quality take-or-pay on-site contract to underpin these projects.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just on the project backlog, I think you mentioned your $3 billion backlog. Do you believe that the backlog has peaked? And where do you see CapEx going? Or do you see CapEx declining over the next 2 or 3 years?
M. Scott Crocco: So, P.J., this is Scott. So as you mentioned, we've got a $3 billion backlog currently and recognize that's going to move around, especially with these projects being fairly large. We would expect for the foreseeable future going forward that the backlog would remain roughly at $3 billion. And in terms of capital spending, this year we said $2 billion, and we think that, that's probably going to be about the range where we come in next year as well, about $2 billion CapEx.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A question for you on returns. John, on Slide 16, you were kind enough to give us the time series of returns on capital employed in your appendix, and I guess if I exclude items, it looks like we're at a multi-year low here. But based on your instantaneous calculation, fairly flat over the last 3 quarters. So my question would be, when you take into account the restructuring efforts you have and the new projects that will be flowing through your financials, what is your outlook for returns from here? Do you think we're near bottom?
John E. McGlade: So one of the things that obviously has depressed the returns is, if you think back over the last maybe 18 months to 2 years, our CapEx has picked up both because of the organic opportunities that we have in the marketplace, so hydrogen, large ASUs, as well as the Indura acquisition. And you've got to grow into that quite frankly. And the way we calculate that return, which is a rolling 5-quarter or 4-quarter average, you begin to feel the impact of that gradually over sort of the next year to 1.5 years going forward. As Scott mentioned a moment ago, with CapEx and bidding activity sort of in the range, minus the acquisitions that we have, we should grow into that, if you will. And then the combination of the actions we're taking to drive the performance in the business, the addition of the new project backlog to the P&L now as they come on stream, and some continued gradual economic recovery, one, I would expect returns to improve; and two, they need to return -- improve. And let me turn it over to Scott, and I'm sure he can provide a little bit more color on that.
M. Scott Crocco: Right. So just to build on what John said, Kevin, so I would see the year coming in on a low 10. As John mentioned, we're working through the projects that are in backlog. And as we've talked about in the past, we've got a lot of existing leverage to load the facilities we have. So I would see kind of a bottoming out, either where we are now or maybe in '14. And then as those projects come on from the backlog, immediately start contributing both to earnings and cash flow, as well as loading the existing capacity we have in our system that will then start driving up both returns on capital, cash flow, as well as earnings.
Operator: We'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Another way of looking at the backlog is, as you think about the cadence of projects over the next few years, is the average life cycle extending? I mean, that is, is it taking longer to bring projects onstream once they get into the backlog? And if so, do you have a rough sense for by how much?
John E. McGlade: So -- I mean, let me weigh in a minute, Laurence, and certainly, Simon or Scott can add some additional commentary to what I'm about to say. The reality of it is we get into -- whether it's a refinery project, a gasification project, although the projects in China tend to be quicker perhaps sometimes than the refinery expansions, these are long-cycle projects, 4 years, 3 or 4 years in the making. We get brought into the process maybe a year into the customer's project, and I would argue that projects are 2.5 years on average, some a little less, some a little more depending on where they're located and the customer, frankly, that's building the project. So I can't -- within months, I can't really see a definitive difference in the cycle if I'm comparing it to large hydrogen additions to refineries as we've seen a lot of historically.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: I had a couple of questions around the LOX/LIN strength that you saw in the U.S. and Canada. Are we really just seeing some of the new accounts that have come onstream over the last several quarters? Or are there other things that you could point to that are driving the strength? Kind of how sustainable do you think those volumes could be?
John E. McGlade: Well, good question, Mike, and I appreciate your acknowledging that the team has done a great job with growing those volumes. And I think what you're really seeing is we've been sharing with you some insight into our contract signings over the last year or so, and we're really seeing a benefit of that step-up and that new business coming on stream. As we've said in the past, though, the overall volumes are also dependent on kind of what's happening with our base business, and I think we've seen some good performance in our base business as well. As I mentioned today, contract signings continue to be strong, so we're optimistic that we'll continue to see good volume growth in our U.S./Canada LOX/LIN business.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: All right. And now that we've gotten some improvements there, I think the expectation is that we would see some pretty big incremental margin. It doesn't look like that's showing up. Obviously, you've got a lot of moving pieces within Merchant. So if we looked at the U.S. and Canada margin on its own, would that margin have improved sequentially? Or there are enough moving pieces and power costs that, that's still creating some pressure?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes, Mike, this is Scott. So between the -- principally, from the power perspective, that would have been the pressure on the margins, recognizing also the Merchant business will pick up its share of the pension impact as well.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And then question on the Mexico business. Have you seen any weakness there related to some of the budget issues that have been going on at PEMEX?
M. Scott Crocco: No, we haven't seen that. Our business in Mexico continues to be very robust, performs well.
John E. McGlade: And, Mike, quite frankly, in the past, we've added that in. To give you some insight in there, if we did add in those Mexico LOX/LIN volumes, it'd be up a little bit more than even the U.S./Canada.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: Got you. And then last one I had is on equipment and energy. You noted the earnings are progressing about in line with the initial guidance, which was for a $0.05 EPS tailwind this year. If I do the math, it looks like you're a little bit ahead of that piece, and it would suggest that Q4 would be down sequentially, but the guidance slide calls for that to be up sequentially. So is it fair to say you're now looking for more than $0.05 of EPS tailwind? And what are your thoughts, maybe kind of early thoughts, on what next year looks like in terms of LNG activity and the Equipment and Energy business?
M. Scott Crocco: Mike, this is Scott. We know that in this business, it's a little bit lumpy. And so just directionally, maybe it's a little bit higher than $0.05 year-on-year, but not huge. And I think as we mentioned before, we continue to see opportunities out there on a global basis, and we continue to not only work down the backlog but look for additional orders and look to have announcements in the not-too-distant future.
Operator: We'll go next to James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Guys, could you just comment a little bit about Merchant pricing trends in Asia?
Simon R. Moore: Yes, Jim, this is Simon. It's a good question. And again, I think one of the things that we need to make sure we're keeping an eye on is not just price on its own, but also kind of the price/cost trade-off. And so specifically in Asia, we have seen some price pressure in our LOX/LIN/LAR, liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen and liquid argon business. So we've seen some negative pricing in Asia in those businesses, and that's come at the same time that we're seeing some power cost increases. So we're seeing -- as we commented, that's one of the key issues that's creating a little bit of a margin squeeze for us in that business. Now if I could just -- the helium scenario is different than what I've just described. Helium pricing has been strong and positive in all the regions.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Gulley with BGC Partners.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: Well, I was going back to the strong backlog of $3 billion. Can you give us an indication and, of course, the whole gasification opportunity in China, about how much of that backlog is in China? And would that number change materially when you get to include some of the hydrogen projects that you've just alluded to?
M. Scott Crocco: So, Mark, this is Scott. I would say about half or so of the backlog is in China. And again, we've got a lot of different opportunities on a global basis, so I would see that number staying about that -- in that range going forward.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: And then secondly, as a follow-up, you talked about the additional restructuring actions, so we're going to hear more a month or so. Looking at the low operating rates, particularly for LOX/LIN in U.S. and Europe, is it safe to assume that you've got to have some asset write-downs, plant closings there to tighten up capacity, maybe get some pricing flexibility? And could that be a big part of the margin improvement you expect to see in Merchant?
M. Scott Crocco: Mark, this is Scott. So we're looking at each -- as we've said before, we're looking at each of our businesses and identifying opportunities to make sure that we are rightsized given the economic environment and the level of business activity. And so there's -- every area of the company is under evaluation.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: And a housekeeping question on PUI being a negative factor. Do we finally lap that in the second quarter of fiscal '14?
M. Scott Crocco: Well -- so it's going to go away at the end of this calendar year, and so we'll see -- in '14, we'll see a year-on-year impact, 1 quarter seen in '14 versus a full year that we saw here in '13. That will take us a while before we lap it.
Operator: We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I had to hop off for a minute, so I apologize if this has been covered, but I wanted to just dive in a little bit into working capital and also pension. The working capital increase so far year-to-date, I believe that's not including Indura. But correct me if I'm wrong about that. Can you just help me understand what's driving it and how that might play out over the balance or, I guess, the one remaining quarter, and then what you might be able to do to improve it going into next year?
M. Scott Crocco: So this is Scott. So working capital does in fact include Indura. We track closely all our accounts and look at past dues, day sales outstanding and so forth. And so there's not -- recognizing there's a mix across the different geographies, we are diligently managing that, and we don't see any issues in terms of working capital.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So x Indura, it looks fine. And then on the pension, given the idea that rates may be increasing in the near future and you made a big pension contribution, I see here, how should we be thinking about that relative to your liability going into next year?
M. Scott Crocco: Let's separate it into 2 pieces. First, the cash and ERISA requirement versus the book accounting. From an ERISA perspective, we feel good about the level of contributions that have been made and don't foresee any large additional contributions in the near term. If I shift then to a book perspective, as you point out, rates -- who knows where they're going to go? But to the extent that they do go up and then reduce the liability on a present value basis, there might be some tailwinds going forward from a book accounting perspective and pensions in the future.
Operator: We'll go next to John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
Ernie Ortiz: This is actually Ernie Ortiz filling in for John. Just on the helium project, with the startup of the project, you've been benefiting with some good pricing recently. Can you just talk about the supply/demand impacts from the new project? How should we think about pricing going forward? And just on overall industry, kind of how it affects it?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. So, Ernie, let me just make a few comments broadly about helium. And so first of all, setting a context that we think over a multi-year time frame, helium remains tight, why is that? We've got increased demand, customers are utilizing more helium in medical applications, in the electronics industry and in welding applications. And at the same time, today, 30% of the world's helium comes from the U.S. government, and that opportunity to supply is declining over time. So there are new sources that are needed to come on to replace some of the decline in existing sources, and we have increasing demand. So that's the kind of long-term time frame. If we step back from that a little bit, we have our project in Wyoming that we expect to get product from later this year. You've also seen, for the industry, some new projects come onstream here just recently. So those projects will help. But quite frankly, again, it's in a framework where the demand is increasing and some of the existing supply is coming down. I would also just note that you might have heard me mention that we have another project, separate from this Wyoming project, that we would expect to have an announcement on fairly soon.
Ernie Ortiz: Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, on Electronics, can you talk about like where industry operating rates are and kind of your outlook for '14 for Electronics?
Simon R. Moore: Sure. I think Electronics -- so first of all, maybe reset for FY '13, our fiscal year, we expect Electronics square inches of silicon demand to be down somewhere in the 0 to a few percent, and that's different than what we had expected of mid-single digit growth when we set out for the year. So clearly, the industry has not grown the way we and others expected for the year. I think -- as we look to 2014, I think the industry forecasts we see are generally up in that mid-single digits range, but we're going to have to take a very hard look at that as we get closer to the end of the year here. I think if there's one good thing in the industry, while it hasn't been a strong growth period, you've seen a relative amount of stability, where inventory levels have maintained relatively stable levels for our customers along this time.
Operator: We'll go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A question on Indura. If you look apples-to-apples, what would margins look like this quarter versus a year ago?
M. Scott Crocco: For Indura? Just to clarify.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, for Indura. Yes.
M. Scott Crocco: They'd be up modestly as we go through the integration and deliver on the synergies that we've expected there as part of the implementation.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And then just last one, quick on Tees Valley. On-time, on-budget there? How is that progressing?
John E. McGlade: Yes, it's progressing quite well. I was over there a month or 2 ago, and the project is on budget, on schedule. The team's really, really charged up about the opportunity and already looking at ways to further improve the existing project authorization through some of the opportunities they've been able to identify.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then just on the Tees Valley and that concept, from a timing standpoint, will we get that plant up and running and proven out before we announce new projects? Or is there a chance that we get new projects before we've actually proven out that system?
John E. McGlade: Well, first, what I'd suggest is every unit op in that facility is a unit op that we operate or have operated across our assets over the years. It's just really the combination of those unit ops. So from a technology point of view and an operating point of view, while we've done very rigorous assessments across -- with internal and external experts, I'm very comfortable with our ability to do this. And I'm very comfortable in our ability to do it with the reliability and capabilities that we've committed to our customer base. So we're going to make decisions on the opportunities for these projects based on the market availability of them, and then frankly, being a first mover into the market, given the profitability of these projects and the opportunity of that to deliver value to our shareholders.
Operator: We'll go next to Basili Alukos with Morningstar.
Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: I commend the work you guys are doing on kind of re-looking at the portfolio and all the cost structure, but I kind of want to go back to that issue. If I go back to 2010 when you had your Analyst Day, you talked about -- originally, there, you had 17% margins. We're looking to get to 20%. There are a lot of puts and takes that have happened from then until now. Obviously, Europe is probably worse than what you expected. I think you talked about Indura maybe being a little bit of -- pulling down margin, at least in the near term. So maybe, at best, we can say the company is at a push for margins relative to that time frame. So kind of in that context, I'm just wondering how you're thinking and taking into account the commentary that you like the portfolio. It looks like margins really haven't kept up, so I'm just wondering, in that context, how are you further thinking about kind of the portfolio?
John E. McGlade: Well, certainly -- let me start with -- where our margins are today aren't acceptable to me. I understand that we need to improve them. And what I was really trying to say, both in the actions we've said we're evaluating, that will help us in that context. As it relates specifically to the portfolio, my commentary there is I like our business positions. I don't necessarily -- around the globe, I don't necessarily like the economic scenarios today in all of those positions, but the combination of the actions we're taking and an expectation, as Scott mentioned in his talk, that Europe is bottoming, Simon's comments on Electronics a little bit ago, where we're probably getting towards the bottom of the cycle there as well, really, I believe, will be accretive to margins as we begin to see some economic uptick over the next number of quarters. The other point I'd make relative to the discussion that you referenced back to in the '10, '11 time frame was one of the things that -- on the positives that has developed is the on-site opportunities driven either by the energy or policy or environmental regulations in China and more broadly, around the globe, that gives us a higher mix of Tonnage. In the short term, that higher mix of Tonnage has some depression on margins as you work through the capital in construction. So you have a depression on margins. Frankly -- typically, on the Tonnage businesses, you have lower absolute margins because of the nature of the energy pass-through, but frankly, also lower absolute risk because of the contract.
Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division: Great. So I guess if I think about it in hypotheticals, speaking, if the economy and the rest of the regions were some type of normal growth and margins were still depressed, then it would be more likely in that scenario to see further pruning and divestitures of the portfolio? And that's more trying to get cost structure in line until the economy, at least in Europe, turned around?
John E. McGlade: Yes. I mean, to be clear -- and I meant what I said. I do like the portfolio that we have today. There are assets and overhead opportunities broadly across the globe, and we'll work on those.
Operator: We'll go next to Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered, but on Electronics, revenues were a little bit lighter than expected, but your margins improved. Was wondering what was driving the margin improvement. Was that mix or cost-cutting?
Simon R. Moore: Well -- so it's really -- I mean, it's a combination of both. Right? We obviously aren't in a robust growth environment from Electronics, and it's still a good job by the team to share margin improvements. Specifically year-on-year, we did have a mix effect in the electronics equipment business that helped that as well.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. Got it. And one thing that struck out at me with your slide on Merchant Gases and just the different pricing trends across the different geographies, the operating rates, the LOX/LIN capacity utilization rates are actually lower in the US and Canada, but you had positive pricing. And in Europe and Asia, you're in the mid-70%s and you have negative pricing. So what accounts for the deltas there in terms of pricing? Is it just the quality of competitors? Or is there anyone out there that's being particularly disruptive on pricing -- or had been in the past, as being less disciplined?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. So I think you make a good observation. And I will say, for the last few quarters, we have seen pricing dynamics that aren't necessarily exactly correlated with overall regional loading rates, right? And so this isn't a commodity business, right? It's a very local business. So specifically, your question on what's happening in pricing, we've got some price pressures across all of the regions, particularly, again, I'm speaking of the LOX/LIN/LAR business. So we are seeing some price pressure in Europe, where prices are coming down. In the U.S./Canada and LOX/LIN, while prices are stable, we've got input costs going up. And in Asia, quite frankly, we've got higher power costs and higher -- and LOX/LIN prices coming down. So I don't know that we would necessarily select one competitor as creating this competitive pressure, but I think you are seeing some price pressure across LOX/LIN, again contrasting that with helium, where pricing continues to be strong.
Operator: This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over for any closing or additional remarks.
John E. McGlade: Thanks, Jessica. Let me just wrap up by saying our focus on increasing shareholder value remains unwavering. Our emphasis on cost reduction, productivity improvement and disciplined project execution remain key priorities. Our future prospects are strong given our record project backlog and the significant leverage we have in our existing assets. You'll have an opportunity to see a replay of this call at 2 p.m. today. And thank you for joining us, and have a great day.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Alicia. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Second Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our CEO; and Scott Crocco, our CFO. After our remarks, we'll be pleased to take your questions. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.
John E. McGlade: Thanks, Simon. Before we take you through the details, let me make several overview remarks. While there were some bright spots, the second quarter was certainly a challenge given the softening of the global economy. Our earnings did come within guidance, but slower-than-expected economic growth and a weak electronics market resulted in lower volumes than we had anticipated. We expect this slow growth environment to continue for some time and are no longer anticipating that stronger second half economic improvement as we had originally planned for. Most importantly, we continue to stay focused on actions within our control. We completed the European restructuring provision that we announced last year on schedule and with the full benefits achieved. We remain focused on execution and continue to drive improvement through cost discipline and productivity. As a result, we saw a good cost performance again this quarter, helping to offset the weaker volume. Over the long term, we are well positioned to grow via our $3 billion project backlog, which is over 80% Onsite/Pipeline business with long-term take-or-pay contract terms, and we've continued to be successful signing new business. In February, we announced another oxygen order for coal gasification in China for Lu’An Mining and just last week, another LNG order from PETRONAS in Malaysia. In our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials businesses, we have a tremendous opportunity to load our existing assets when the economy does improve, and our cash priorities remain unchanged. Invest in core projects that have good returns; increase the dividend each year, which we've done now for 31 consecutive years, having announced an 11% increase in March; strive to maintain an A bond rating; and repurchase shares, which you saw us do in Q1 for $460 million. In addition, let me assure you we will continue to take decisive actions to improve our operation and deliver value to shareholders regardless of economic condition. Now let me turn the call over to Scott to review our results.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 3. As we look back at this past quarter, the economy came in at the low end of what we anticipated when I provided you with our guidance in January. March volumes were a disappointment relative to the normal historical uptick we typically see to this month. Moving around the globe. In North America, we experienced modest growth. Europe sunk deeper into recession, with Southern Europe remaining particularly weak, while the Northern continent and Central Europe worsened. And in Asia, there was a lower-than-expected ramp up after the Lunar New Year holiday. As I'm sure you've heard from other sources, the electronics industry has remained soft. We have seen new fab construction delays, and the outlook for silicon processing has been reduced significantly. MSI forecasts are now flat to down for our fiscal 2013 versus previous forecasts of 4% to 6% growth. For Air Products, both electronics materials and equipment sales were below our expectations. The pricing environment has held up to date, but is increasingly more difficult due to softer volumes. However, we continued to deliver good cost performance. As a result, we delivered EPS within the range provided in January. With that backdrop, let me take you through our overall results. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were 6% higher versus prior year, with the Indura and DA Nano acquisitions contributing 6%. On an underlying basis, sales were down 2% due to our previously announced decision to exit the Polyurethane Intermediates or PUI business. Excluding PUI, higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment and higher equipment segment sales were offset by lower volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant segments. Sequentially, overall sales declined 3%, primarily due to lower volumes in our Tonnage segment as a result of planned customer maintenance outages. Simon will provide additional segment and geographic details later. Operating income of $390 million increased 4% versus prior year and increased 5% sequentially. Our operating margin of 15.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily on acquisitions and higher pension expense, partially offset by better cost performance. Sequentially, our margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to last quarter's inventory revaluation and cost improvement. Net income and diluted earnings per share were up 3% and 5%, respectively, versus last year. Our return on capital employed at 10.9% was lower due to our higher capital spending, acquisitions and the lower asset loadings. Turning to Slide 4. You can see an overview of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations EPS of $1.37 increased $0.06 or 5% versus last year. Volumes increased EPS by $0.07, including $0.06 from acquisitions. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased EPS by $0.04 due to higher energy and distribution cost primarily in our Merchant business. Net cost performance was $0.07 favorable despite a $0.03 unfavorable pension impact. Base business costs were positive, primarily due to the impact of our European cost reduction and improved operating efficiencies. Also, our other income and expense P&L line item typically averages about $10 million to $12 million of income per quarter. This quarter's results were a bit higher than average as they include a gain of about $0.02 from an asset sale. Excluded from the volume and cost lines is the net $0.02 unfavorable impact from our decision to exit the PUI business. Currency translation and foreign exchange, taken together, were $0.02 unfavorable as we experienced a small FX loss this year compared with a small FX gain last year. Equity affiliate income contributed $0.01 on a continued strong results from our Mexican affiliate. Noncontrolling interest was $0.01 lower due to the addition of Indura. Interest expense was $0.02 higher due to acquisitions and last quarter's share repurchases. The tax rate was unchanged versus last year. We now expect our tax rate for the year to come in between 24% and 25%, slightly lower than previous guidance. And finally, lower shares outstanding contributed $0.02. Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Scott. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of $1 billion were up 14% versus prior year driven by the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were down 1% on 2% lower volumes and 1% positive price. Volume weakness was most apparent in lower demand in Europe and in helium due to supply limitations globally. Sales were down 1% sequentially. Underlying sales were down 1% on flat pricing and 1% lower volumes due to helium and the Lunar New Year in Asia. Helium production was lower in the U.S. and Algeria driven by operational challenges with our helium feedstock suppliers. We expect these issues to improve in our third quarter. Going forward, we expect supply from our Wyoming facility by the end of our fiscal year and further Qatar supply to the industry into early next year. We are also actively developing additional new sources and expect to be able to make a specific announcement soon. However, we expect supply to remain tight over the next few years until this longer-term capacity can be brought on stream. Merchant Gases operating income of $168 million was up 10% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.8% was down 50 basis points compared to last year and essentially flat sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on profits from the Indura acquisition and improved productivity, including the benefits from our Europe cost reduction programs. As Scott mentioned, we also saw a $0.02 benefit in merchant from an asset sale. This was partially offset by lower volumes and higher energy and distribution costs that were not fully recovered with price increases. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the Indura business. We have delivered on the expected synergies with good cost performance and are seeing growth opportunities in small on-sites for a variety of end markets. As we expected and said in the past, given Indura's business mix, their margins are in the low double digits. As a result, for the quarter, Indura negatively impacted segment margins by about 80 basis points. Excluding the Indura impact, segment margins were up 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily on improved productivity. Versus prior quarter, we did see the impact of lower seasonal volumes in Asia with a slower post-Lunar New Year recovery. Let's look at the business -- the Merchant business by region, please turn to Slide 6. In U.S./Canada, sales were down 1% on 2% lower volumes and 1% higher price. As I mentioned, helium supply remained a challenge this quarter accounting for the negative volume variance. Liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen volumes were up on strengthened metals processing and primary materials. Liquid argon volumes were down on lower demand. Contract signings were solid and lost business was minimal. LOX/LIN capacity utilization remained in the low 70s. Pricing continues to be favorable led by helium but overall did not fully recover recent power and distribution cost increases. We continue to work hard on pricing and you probably saw that we announced a price increase just last week. In Europe, sales were down 5% versus last year on lower volumes across most markets, particularly food, metals and construction. Regionally for LOX/LIN, while the U.K., Ireland and Southern Europe continued to decline, we did see an even more significant drop-off in the northern continent and Central Europe, particularly Poland. And for packaged gases, we saw declines across Europe, but particularly in central and southern Europe. Overall pricing was flat with some pressure on liquid products offset by positive helium pricing. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the mid-70s. The new contract signings were up significantly versus last year as the team leveraged the integration of our liquid bulk and packaged gas sales teams in Europe. In Asia, sales were up 4% versus last year. Underlying sales were up 2% on flat volumes and 2% higher price. Currency had a positive 2% effect. LOX/LIN volumes were up across the region and up mid-single digits in China. Liquid argon volumes continue to be weak across the region on lower PV and fabrication demand. Cylinder volume growth was moderated by customer profitability actions, and we continue to see good growth in our Microbulk product line. Pricing was up 2% primarily on helium strength as we are seeing some price pressure in the liquid oxygen and nitrogen business, particularly in China. Plant loadings were made in the mid-70s. Additional capacity will continue to impact loadings over the next few quarters despite the volume growth, and new contract signings for the quarter were the best in years. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $809 million were up 3% versus last year on new plant volumes and higher energy passthrough, partially offset by lower PUI volumes. As expected, base volumes were relatively flat as plant customer maintenance outages in Europe were mostly offset by stronger U.S. Gulf Coast volumes. We are proceeding with the exit of our Polyurethane Intermediates business. For the quarter, PUI sales were down about $50 million versus prior year, and operating income was down about $5 million. For the full year, we expect PUI sales to be down about $160 million and operating income to be down about $25 million, more than expected due to higher shutdown costs and lower volumes. For the segment, sequentially, sales were down 10% on 8% lower volumes ex-PUI. As expected, planned customer maintenance outages and lower spot volumes impacted sales. Operating income of $123 million was down 2% versus prior year. Ex-PUI, operating income of $117 million was up 3% on stronger new plant volumes and improved plant efficiencies. Operating income was down 11% sequentially on lower volumes and higher maintenance costs due to the expected outages. Operating margin of 15.2% was down 80 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to bonus timing and the higher energy cost passthrough. Margin declined 20 basis points sequentially on the lower volumes. We are pleased to have announced a new long-term agreement with Shanxi Lu'An mining, a large provincial state-owned coal mining company. We will supply over 10,000 tons per day of oxygen, as well as nitrogen, air and steam to their coal gasification project in Shanxi Province, China. Lu’An will use the oxygen to gasify coal and produce diesel fuel. Including the Lu’An project, we are now executing 7 projects to supply oxygen for coal gasification in China, totaling over 38,000 tons per day, all under long-term contracts with take-or-pay terms. Great success by the team, and we continue to see strong bidding activity in this growing market. We also have seen strong project development activity in the global hydrogen business. Customer are making decisions, and we expect to have more to say on this in the near future. Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $549 million were down 3% versus last year, with lower base electronics volumes partially offset by the DA Nano acquisition. Sequentially, sales were flat. Versus prior year, electronic sales were down 3% with the DA Nano acquisition, partially offsetting lower equipment sales in an overall weaker materials market. The lower equipment sales are not surprising given the slowdown in new fab CapEx, but we do expect this to rebound by the end of the year. Tonnage continues to show growth with new projects coming on stream. In the more advanced materials, we continue to see customer adoption of our solutions, creating growth opportunities even in the weak market. However, for the more mature process materials, we are seeing volumes impacted by lower fab utilization and competitive activity impacting both volumes and prices driven by the much lower outlook for the rest of 2013. Sales were down 5% sequentially primarily on lower equipment sales. Performance Materials sales were down 3% versus last year on both volume and price impacts. While the auto market remains consistent, we have seen weakness globally in construction, industrial coatings and particularly marine coatings. Prices were down slightly more than costs. Sequentially, PMD sales were up 7% on seasonal improvement, particularly in Europe and North America. Operating income of $78 million was down 9% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 100 basis points to 14.1%. Operating income and margin were impacted by lower volumes and price pressure. Sequentially, operating income was up 26% and operating margin was up 290 basis points, primarily due to the inventory revaluation last quarter. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $124 million were up 12% versus prior year and up 17% sequentially primarily on higher LNG project activity. Operating income of $21 million more than doubled prior year and prior quarter on the higher LNG project activity and lower development spending. This is consistent with the guidance we provided for significant improvement in the business for 2013. The backlog of $326 million is up 5% over last year and down 16% versus last quarter as new orders in Q2 were modest, but bidding activity remains strong. As an example of the strong LNG activity, we just announced a new order with PETRONAS in Malaysia last week to support the expansion of their Bintulu LNG complex. This is the second order we announced with PETRONAS over the last year following the floating LNG project announced last July. We would expect additional LNG announcements through the rest of the year. Now I'll turn the call back over to Scott.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 10 and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. Given the weakness we saw coming out of fiscal Q2, we are tempering our expectations for economic growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Manufacturing output has slowed globally, and we now expect a more muted recovery off this lower base. As a result, we think it is appropriate to reduce our full year EPS guidance to $5.45 to $5.60. In the U.S., slower growth in manufacturing output is expected to come in at the low end of our range. Uncertainty in the economy remains and unresolved fiscal challenges may impact the recovery. In Europe, the recession worsened during Q2 due to widespread austerity programs and high unemployment. We now expect Europe and particularly the countries, where we have higher exposure, to so show negative year-over-year growth in manufacturing for FY '13. In Asia, we expect a gradual acceleration in manufacturing growth to continue, benefiting from more stimulus spending on infrastructure projects, particularly in China and Korea. And in South America, Chilean manufacturing was strong in January but slowed through the rest of the quarter. We expect the year to be consistent with our original expectations. Our backlog is back up to $3 billion, primarily from the addition of the Lu'An coal project. We still see a number of outstanding opportunities in the oxygen for coal gasification market in China and in hydrogen projects around the world, but continue to see decisions being delayed on electronics projects. Based on the strong backlog of projects, we signed long-term contracts with take-or-pay terms. CapEx is expected to be about $2 billion this year, consistent with our most recent guidance. And as I mentioned, we now expect our tax rate for the year to come in between 24% and 25%. For Q3, our EPS guidance is $1.33 to $1.38 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see improved sequential volumes in our Merchant and Performance Material businesses, slightly improved economic activity in seasonality, as well as improved volumes in our Tonnage Gasses segment due to less planned customer outages. Partially offsetting the sequential improvement, we expect a lower level of activity in our Equipment and Energy segment similar to the level that we saw in fiscal Q1 with an uptick in Q4, a greater impact from the PUI business exit, and we expect further headwinds from higher pension settlement costs and lower gains from asset sales. Now let me turn it over to John.
John E. McGlade: Thanks, Scott. As I reflect on the first half of fiscal year '13, Air Products delivered earnings growth in a very challenging economic environment, where our base volume growth was well below what we had anticipated. This earnings growth is a result of the actions we have taken to tackle things within our control, with a particular focus on reducing costs, driving productivity and disciplined project execution. We also repurchased $460 million in shares in the first half of the year and raised our dividend 11%. You have seen us take a number of steps to optimize our portfolio over the last year, including selling our European Homecare business, exiting the PUI business and restructuring our PV market position. And in light of the continuing slow growth environment, we are actively assessing whether there are additional actions we can take that would result in increased value to our shareholders. In closing, I believe Air Products remains well positioned to deliver increased shareholder value. We have a strong backlog of projects. We have significant leverage on our existing assets that leave us well positioned for recovery, and we remain sharply focused on productivity, improving our core businesses and delivering on our cash priorities. Thank you, and now we are happy to take your questions. Alicia?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I guess 2 quick questions. First, given the current outlook, can you give a little bit more of a sense on the restructuring in Europe? I mean, and how much more you might need to do to see significant margin improvement there if demand doesn't recover? And secondly, with the slower demand environment this year, does that change the way you think about how much of a backlog-related tailwind you should have next fiscal year because some of the projects that come on stream this year would fully -- would be ramping up with a bit of a lag?
John E. McGlade: Thank you, yes. Laurence, this is John. On your first question, as we noted, we did complete the restructuring in Europe on schedule and on budget delivering the benefits that we forecasted. Certainly, and my comments in the script are we're going to continue to look across our portfolio as to what the current business environment looks like and we'll make judgments around any additional actions we need to take as we go through our planning cycle this summer and as we link that planning cycle with the business environment we see going forward. From the standpoint of the backlog impact for next year, and then I'll let Scott add some commentary here as well, I think we've talked a number of times around the fact that while the general economic environment in a lot of the markets that we operate and particularly impacting, say, our Merchant and Electronics businesses, the bidding activity in sort of the energy and the environmental areas, whether it be larger separation fracs for gasification, hydrogen LNG continues to remain strong, and the majority of those projects are currently in execution and meeting what we would have anticipated to be schedules associated with large, complex projects like that.
M. Scott Crocco: And just to build, this is Scott. I just want to reinforce that over 80% of our projects and backlog are tied to long-term take-or-pay contracts, and so we're not exposed to the general economic uncertainties that we are when we put in merchant capacity.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Then just a very quick clarification on the helium. The BLM is talking about shifting to market-based pricing supplies. Would that be neutral for you or negative?
Simon R. Moore: Laurence, this is Simon. It's a good question. There's obviously a lot of dynamics going on in the helium supply. There's different bills in front of different sections of the government to extend the helium program. What we believe is the BLM will want to continue to provide helium that will help enable industry as best as it can, and we're going to be a key player in that helium business going forward. At this point, it's unclear exactly how that's going to shake out but we think helium will continue to be a good part of Air Products going forward.
Operator: We'll go next to Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. Just looking to understand how much the firmness in the general outlook for natural gas prices over the quarter would have been a tailwind in the guidance prior to the back half macro headwind?
M. Scott Crocco: This is Scott. There really hasn't been any change in our outlook for natural gas in terms of our results or guidance.
Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in the past, you've a bit more aggressive with the purchases around the current share price levels. Is the lower outlook going to change the strategy? Or should we expect a similar case?
M. Scott Crocco: There's no change to our strategy and our cash priorities, just to reemphasize. We're going to focus primarily and foremost on core projects with good returns, focus on raising the dividend and striving to maintain an A rating, and then buy back shares. I will remind folks, too, that we did do a share repurchase last quarter of about $460 million. And if I look back over the last 7 years or so, we did about $3 billion of share repurchases. That said, at this point in time, we're always looking at it, I wouldn't see anything on the order of what we did in the first quarter going forward in terms of share repurchase.
Operator: We'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So I think you reduced your guidance for the year by $0.27. And if you look at the midpoints -- and so that's about $57 million after tax, $76 million pretax and so your margins are roughly 15%. So what that would imply is something like a $500 million reduction to your self expectations, which seems like an awful lot. So is that really what you're trying to do with your guidance? And of the $76 million in pretax income that should disappear versus your previous expectation, where should it disappear from by segment?
M. Scott Crocco: So the 2 areas -- Jeff, this is Scott. The 2 areas that we've seen the biggest decline is in electronics. As we talked about previously, we had expectations of MSI growth being in the 4% to 6% range, now flat to down year-on-year. And then additionally, as we also mentioned in Europe, while things haven't been robust there all year, we expected a turn for the second half of the year as -- and instead we've continued to see a decline here in the second quarter, and so with particular weakness now emerging in Central and Northern Europe. So the 2 areas that we're going to see the biggest decline are in the electronics area for the materials and the Europe merchant business.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. That's clear enough. It's funny when you look at TSMC volumes or UMC volumes, they looked reasonably good on a monthly basis but it really doesn't come across in your electronics results. Can you just describe a little bit more precisely why -- it looks like there are winners and losers in the electronics area and how that might affect your overall volumes?
John E. McGlade: Great question, Jeff. And I think it's a reminder that the electronics market is certainly dynamic, and while we can talk in general about what's happening to the overall industry, and again as Scott has said, it looks clear that the forecast for industry growth this year are much below expectations, were at the beginning of the year. You're absolutely right. In addition, within there, certain companies have strengths and weaknesses. The foundries continue to benefit from the idea that folks want to outsource production of chips. At the same time, you see some other companies perhaps that are more tied into PCs that are showing a little bit less growth. But I think again, as we have said before, we touch all the key players in this segments. We're the leading supplier to Samsung, Intel and TSMC, which we believe over the long term will continue to be the right companies to be with. They're making the capital investments to drive growth going forward. And so really the industry, again, flat to down for the year, and that's one of the big reasons why our expectations are below what they were.
Operator: We'll go next to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Could you -- maybe we could triangulate some of the comments in terms of the -- staying within that A rating and considering other strategic actions, which sounds like might include further divestitures and then your comments on not being as aggressive mostly likely with share repurchases relative to what we saw last quarter and then just sort of the negative free cash flow year-to-date. I mean, if the economic environment sort of continues as it is and earnings are going to be flat, I think, for about the third year in a row, where does all this settle out from balance sheet perspective and how aggressive do you think you can be?
John E. McGlade: So, first, let's try to take this from the top and go down. We've taken a lot of actions over the last number of years, both from a portfolio point of view and from a restructuring point of view, which I quite frankly feel we've got the right portfolio for success going forward. Certainly, the economic environment hasn't helped us, and we made the comment that we have a fairly large amount of leverage on our existing assets in merchant and electronics that we believe will provide benefits as we see slowly recovering economic growth as we look out beyond '13, our fiscal year '13. And so from that perspective, I'm pretty comfortable that we're in the right place. What I was commenting on is we'll look and we'll calibrate what that economic environment is as we go through our planning process for '14 and make adjustments to -- more to our cost base than to, let's say, our portfolio of businesses, which I did comment on I was comfortable with. The other point I'd like to make is right now as where the opportunities are in the gasification and then the hydrogen area, and that's an area as I mentioned earlier where we do see growth, and that will be good, solid growth under our tonnage business model for the future and so we're going to continue to pursue those opportunities.
M. Scott Crocco: So, this is Scott. So just to build on those comments. As we've said in the past, our focus is on executing the projects that are in the backlog, again, over 80% of which have take-or-pay terms. And while we have a terrific opportunity to load the existing assets in our Merchant business and our Electronics business, given the economic environment, we're not waiting for the economy to come back in order to load them, rather we're taking the actions in the areas that we can control to improve the margins as quickly as possible and improve our cash flow going forward.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And can I just ask a quick follow-up on -- I don't think you've covered this in the prepared remarks. The inventory revaluation in Electronics and Performance Materials, can you just go through what that was?
M. Scott Crocco: So, yes, just to refresh folks, back in the end of last year, we -- typically during the course of the year, we have inventory held at standard, when we get to the end of the year and we moved it to actual. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we moved it back to standard. Typically, when you make that move between year end and the new year, there's not that big of a movement in terms of the inventory carrying value. However, we've taken actions to reduce our cost, both from a supplier perspective, as well as bringing in some manufacturing capability in-house. And so while there was an inventory adjustment down in the first quarter, we're going to get that back over the course of the year as we see higher margins. And so that was, just to remind you about a $10 million impact that we saw in the first quarter, which did not repeat here in the second quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of questions on oxygen for gasification of coal in China. If I think about the, I guess, the 7 large projects that you've won there, would you comment on how the aggregate returns would compare to the company average return on capital employed of 10.9% on Slide 3? Is it lower or similar or higher? How should we think about that as those begin to flow through?
John E. McGlade: Kevin, yes, this is John, and then I can let Scott add color to this as well. Bottom line, you know that well that we do risk-adjusted returns that look at the project risk, the country risk, the cost of debt, inflation, et cetera. And when you add all of those together, China is going to have an absolute higher hurdle rate, if you will, than the corporate average and such that, while I'm not going to disclose the average returns, we feel good about the overall returns of these projects when they achieve their potential to be accretive to the returns of the company. Recognize that a project like this when you make an investment day 1 takes time for it to grow into its return on capital because, if you will, because you're putting all the capital out 3 years before you begin to produce any cash flow from the project.
M. Scott Crocco: That's right. So just to build on that. So there's the whip spending before it starts contributing back to earnings. And then just to remind folks, when you bring it on, it would be completely undepreciated. And so as you go through time, depreciation comes down, as depreciation comes down, you'll see an improvement in the ROC.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Understood. So if I look at it on an IRR basis, it sounds like the returns will be higher due to the error [ph] for country risk. Is that fair?
John E. McGlade: That's a fair statement.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, do you think the pace of coal gasification-related oxygen activity in China will be similar the next couple of years or any faster or slower than what we've seen for the last 2 years?
John E. McGlade: So I think what you've seen in, say, to the latter part of this past year is a slowdown in, frankly, in approval of some of the projects, as China was going through its governmental changes at different levels of leadership, and so they slowed things down. Our view is that the pace of this market will continue at or above sort of if you look over the last several years the trend line rate that you saw there. It's an absolute key to both their goals around energy independence and frankly, environmental benefits by really driving these projects to really typically 1 of 3 output products. So right to diesel fuel, so a clean diesel fuel or to a synthetic natural gas, again, a more cleaner burning fuel that will be put in pipelines and pushed to the Eastern Seaboard or directly into olefins as a chemical feedstock, our building block. And our assessment of the market is that there's multiple opportunities of the scale and quantity of projects that you've seen if you looked over a trend line of the last several years.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then final question, John, if I may. You've taken action in European health care and PUI. Are there any businesses remaining in your portfolio that you would consider noncore?
John E. McGlade: So I made a comment earlier, and I'll go back to that. I actually like where the portfolio is today. I'd like to see more improvement in terms of the underlying profitability of the businesses, and I believe that will be there as we see some economic recovery in them because we have gotten a lot of the cost structure right, and we've taken a lot of actions on productivity. But the composition of the portfolio, and what I believe either their current or future contributions, the value to be are solid.
Operator: And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I have a question on Indura. The hardgoods business at Indura was a big piece of the portfolio. How is that business holding up? And I know that Indura was not big in Brazil, but Brazil sort of drives the Latin American growth. And with slowdown in Brazil and the rest of Latin America, what's the risk to Indura's portfolio?
John E. McGlade: So P.J., obviously, South America or Latin America in general has slowed down some. It's still growing more robustly than most of the other geographies that we're operating in. Indura is meeting our expectations across a the broad business. The area that's probably weaker as we sit here today in Chile in particular is the mining segment, and that's obviously a piece of what Indura supplies in, more on the equipment side of things than the gases side of things. The good news on Indura is, first, it is holding up in terms of what REAR expectations were on costs and our being able to deliver the synergies, and then second what we bring to the table with Indura is a broader portfolio of offerings that's allowing us to enter into new market segments, if you will, from a merchant point of view and into the small on-site and Tonnage businesses that Indura hadn't been focused on historically. From a Brazil point of view, you're correct. Indura really doesn't operate in Brazil. I think you know that we have a business in Brazil that Air Products has had for many years and obviously, that business has followed the way the Brazilian economy has performed. And frankly, there, what we're doing is we've taken a lot of actions around improving our productivity, driving down our variable cost of production there, and we'll continue to look at what the opportunities are to leverage the significant investment that we now have in a fairly strong #2 position in South America and frankly, in some countries the #1 position. So how do we get the benefits, if you will, of the Indura position within the geographies they play in with some of the offerings that they have that might make sense in Brazil.
M. Scott Crocco: And just to build on John's comments, we are very pleased with how the integration is going. At the beginning of this fiscal year, we gave you guidance that year-on-year, we would expect to see a $0.10 increase in our earnings per share based off of Indura and a smooth integration in delivering the synergies, and we're on track to deliver that.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Your overall CapEx spending is still about 2x D&A. And with the slowdown in growth around the world, maybe outside of the U.S., are you seeing any delays in projects given this -- given sort of lower stimulus spending you talked about in China?
John E. McGlade: Yes, I think so. I think we really have to think about it in 2 buckets, P.J. Certainly, from the standpoint of -- and I don't know that we're not unique relative to our competitors. Certainly from the standpoint of investment in merchant capacity, yes, there's a slowdown in the investment in merchant capacity. And also obviously, in -- as you've seen in some of the electronic sectors, where people have announced not sort of a cancellation of fabs, but perhaps a several quarter delay until either they see a stronger market coming back. More importantly, though, I think, if I go back to the large oxygen for gasification in the hydrogen area, they're being driven by different macro dynamics than the underlying economy. They're being driven either by, in China, a combination of energy independence and environmental regulations around how they get to cleaner fuels or how they get to substitute fuels, and then sort of China plus the global environment, cleaner -- the demand for cleaner transportation fuel is continuing to drive hydrogen. And as Scott mentioned, 80% of our backlog is in those 2 product lines fundamentally to support the tonnage business segment and have tonnage type of terms and conditions.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just I want to clarify something that Scott said. Scott, did you say that you saw weakness in Southern Europe now spreading to Central and Northern Europe?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes, we've seen in both Central and Northern Europe. While there's always been a decline -- we saw an acceleration of decline in those 2 regions here in the second quarter.
Operator: We'll go next to Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A question -- I apologize you'll have to follow some math here. But in 2008, you guys did roughly $5 of EPS. This year on your guidance, you'll do mid-point $5.50 or so. So roughly a $0.50 increase. But if you look from 2008 to 2012, you spent about $8.5 billion in capital or about $39 a share. And the way I break that down $15 was for maintenance, $24 a share was for growth. So if you just use simple math and say, okay, we want a 10% pretax return on that capital at $24 a share, that should be about $2.40 a share, tax effective, that's about $1.80. So the capital should have grown earnings by about $1.80 a share where we've only grown $0.50. So can you help me triangulate that missing $1.20 or $1.30? How much of it is my assumptions on returns are wrong? How much of it is maybe the base business that was there in 2008 and significantly smaller now? But it just feels like we're not getting the bang for the buck when we're spending the capital that we should.
M. Scott Crocco: So 2 big elements, Duffy, and I appreciate you providing the math. I have to look at it after the call. But the 2 fundamental issues here are, as you mentioned, the investment that we've made in the base business around the merchant terms and conditions, not loading that capacity. We did not see the downturn coming that has come upon us. And so as we mentioned before, we're taking actions to control our costs for when the economy comes back. The other element, of course, is from as we talked about from the backlog, fact that we've got $3 billion in that backlog and it is currently not contributing to sales or earnings, that's why we need to focus on executing those projects and then bringing them on stream.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Fair enough. And then I guess, the follow-on question would be even though they're on-site, if we don't start to see the earnings increases from capital, how long is the rope before we actually start to significantly ratchet it back to capital spending?
John E. McGlade: Well, as I said earlier, if they are on an on-site basis, we do expect that recognize. We kicked up our capital from a '10 level and '11 level to a much more significant level in '12 and in '13, and these projects have about a 3-year whip frankly from the time that you put them in the capital stack or the backlog until they are brought on stream. We're constantly asking ourselves the questions around our priorities for cash and looking at whether or not these continue to be consistent with their attractive projects that support the long-term growth. I think we've demonstrated throughout the last 5 or 6 years, as Scott mentioned earlier, we make those judgments -- real time's a poor choice of words, but we make those judgments as conditions change and move between investing in the business buying $3 billion of shares back and increasing the dividend each of the last 31 years. And from my perspective, the growth opportunities provided they fit their strategy and they meet our return criteria are ultimately going to contribute the value that our shareholders are expecting from us.
Operator: We'll go next to Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: John, a question on U.S. merchant. Your loadings continue to languish here in the low 70s. I know that post the end of the Air gas bid, you put in place a major initiative in mini-bulk and expanded your sales force, and I know you talked about increasing signing. So I'm just wondering, where the payoff from this effort is. Or -- and I guess, as a follow-up to that, do you need to rationalize some of your U.S. merchant system? And just wondering if you feel you're disadvantaged by not having a cylinder gas outlet for some of that liquid?
John E. McGlade: So let me start from the back and go forward. Obviously, the calculus of getting back into a Package Gas business was the whole thought process around an integrated gas model. Therefore, more touches to the market through the sales teams, as well as more touches to a broader set of vertical sectors or market sectors. And that's old history. But if I go more to what we have done, I do feel good about the fact that we've added sales forces. We've added commercial technology resources. We've been extremely selective on where we would add capacity. And the new signings in the business have increased year-on-year for the last several years as we've added those resources. So we're getting a payoff there. What isn't as readily obvious is that the underlying base business, and I don't think this is unique to Air Products, has not been as strong as we would have hoped in the recent number of quarters. And so what you have is you're getting the benefit of the signings, they're coming in. The losses in the business are at typical levels, so they haven't moved up significantly at all. But the underlying economy, and when we came into this planning in the year, we thought we'd see a 2 to a 4 with a hope that we were going towards 4 in the U.S. business. And we're -- quite frankly, from an economic, there's a general macroeconomic closer to 2, 2.5 as we sit here today. So a lot of words to say, yes, I'm comfortable that the resource adds are delivering the merit that they were justified on. I'm not comfortable with the broader underlying business performance in certain sectors. So think of oilfield services. Simon may want to add some more color on some of the sectors that are more...
Simon R. Moore: Great, great, john. And the lonely thing I was going to just add is, Don, is of course, when we show you the negative 2% volume for U.S./Canada, that's across the spectrum of products. And as we mentioned on the comments, that's really driven by the helium supply challenges. In fact, if you take a look at our LOX/LIN business in U.S./Canada, it's up modestly versus prior year. It's also up sequentially. So as John said, we're starting to see the benefit of some of these new contract signings the team is bringing in.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And John, a portfolio follow-up. You haven't talked much about Performance Materials, but that's not really a core gases business. I know it's been attractive financially in the past, but won't you think there's a higher value owner of that business out there and that you could use to fund to pay down debt or do something else for shareholders?
John E. McGlade: Well, so, Don, as I mentioned earlier in the call, I feel comfortable about the portfolio we have today. That statement is inclusive of Performance Materials. Frankly, it adds value to the shareholders, and I really believe that we're delivering and are operating as a high-value owner of that business today.
Operator: We'll go next to David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: John, Air Products, I was curious, if you could talk about industrial gas is growing at a multiple GDP, maybe 1.3x, 1.5x. Has that multiplied or IP -- has that multiplier compressed over the past few years?
John E. McGlade: I think, so that would be -- that's sort of an all-in average, if you will. That's going to really be a function of the maturity level of the economies that you're growing in. And so if you were to look at areas like Latin America and you were to look at Asia sort of during a trend line time versus some of the blips we have seen in the economic cycle, I think that multiple still holds pretty well. Certainly, in the more mature economies of the world, it's at the low end of that. And then if you go into a scenario where you're in Europe, where you have an economic decline, obviously, there's very limited growth there and therefore you're not going to get that. And so that's what -- you got to aggregate the different economies of the world to come to that.
M. Scott Crocco: As well as the drivers. So as John mentioned before, well, that's high-level statistic over a long period of time. There are fundamental drivers that aren't directly correlated with GDP or manufacturing output. For example, coal oxygen for coal gasification, driving energy independence in China; hydrogen for cleaner fuels. Those sorts of drivers or things that are not directly cause and effect to manufacturing output or GDP.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's helpful. And Scott, just on the backlog, what was the actual backlog at quarter end? And given the number of projects coming on stream, shouldn't that be lower by year end?
M. Scott Crocco: So $3 billion is where we were at the end of this quarter, and it's lumpy. So as projects come in and come out, it might be -- I don't see a substantial change by year end, maybe down a little bit as we process through some of the projects in there. But also of course depends on the wins, and we feel good about some opportunities to what we're pursuing as well.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Harrison from First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: You mentioned some LOX/LIN pricing pressure in both Europe and Asia. I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color around what's driving that, could it worsen? And maybe just talking in general terms about LOX/LIN supply and demand dynamics in the competitive environment that you're seeing across Asia, Europe and North America?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes, good question, Mike. And I think it's important to frame that right. So what we're not saying is that we've seen a step change or anything like that in competitive price pressure. But I think as you look at the different regions, particularly if you look at the region like Asia, there's clearly some extra capacity in the ground for the industry right now. So I think what we're just trying to help you appreciate is we are seeing a slight increase in competitive pressure. I would say you tend to see that more on new business. So it's not so much that we are seeing competitive pressure on existing business, but new business growth is eagerly looked for by most of the companies. So that's probably the case in Asia. Again in Europe, we're not signaling any step change here, but a little bit more pressure on the LOX/LIN. As we said, we have -- the team is doing a great job on new contact signings and traditionally, those do come out at slightly lower price than the base business. In North America, we talked about we are getting positive price. You saw the price increase announcement that we put out last week. We believe that, that makes sense, and we can continue to earn more price increases, recognizing that we have seen power and distribution cost increases as well.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And can you talk in a little bit more detail about some of the higher costs you're seeing that's driving you to push a little bit harder on the merchant pricing? Are those just U.S. costs? And I guess, as you look out a couple of quarters, are you still going to be playing catch-up on cost, or do you think you should be covered if you get the traction that you're looking for?
M. Scott Crocco: Well, it's a good question. And I think you appreciate that while we put that price increase out and certainty that triggers the discussion with our customers, really our pricing decisions are made on a customer-by-customer basis. So we take a good, hard look at the economics and the profitability of a customer and make a decision about what we want to do from a price standpoint. Again, I would say primarily in the U.S., which is what the price increase announcement was referring to, again, as I said it was really power and distribution costs that we'll be hoping to catch up on.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And sticking with the North American merchant market, can you talk a little bit about how volumes were trending during the quarter? It sounds like if we sort of exclude what's going on with helium and just look at LOX/LIN, that net-net, it was flat, it was maybe slightly up during the quarter, year-on-year. Presumably January was pretty strong and February weakened, what have you been seeing over the last 2 months or so?
M. Scott Crocco: Well, it's a good question. And again, as we said, overall for the quarter we were up slightly. I don't think we saw anything significantly different as he went through the 3 months of the quarter. So it was fairly consistent relative to last year.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: All right. And last question is just on the Tonnage business in the hydrogen spot sales that were pretty strong last quarter. You didn't expect those to be sustainable into this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what spot activity look like, and in particular how the Gulf Coast pipeline was operating during Q2?
John E. McGlade: So I think, from a strategic point of view, that investment has demonstrated its worth in the first couple of quarters, that it's been operating, whether it be from the standpoint of the spot volumes, the efficiencies and the productivity or cost gains that we can get. The biggest issue probably in Q2 was a number of significant turnarounds of our customers facilities combined with a couple of unexpected outages at 2 important customers that gave, frankly, the whole opportunity to sell more hydrogen less of an opportunity. I didn't quite phrase that right, but you had less of an opportunity because you had some of the biggest sources or users, some of the biggest customers down either because of scheduled turnarounds or unscheduled turnarounds. But if I were to step back and say from a strategic point of view, has that created competitive -- a differentiated competitive position for us? Absolutely. And does it give us the opportunity to continue to drive productivity efficiency and spot sales? Also absolutely.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Sison from KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of your outlook for Tonnage new projects coming in this year, I think, it was $0.25 to $0.30. Is that the same, and just curious of, how much of that came in the first half? And I would imagine the remaining is pretty visible to you.
M. Scott Crocco: Yes, Mike, this is Scott. So we do see it still in that range probably with some of the projects that have been deferred by a quarter or so, maybe trending towards the low end of that range, but still in that range. And I would say while we've seen some of it that's going to be more towards the back half of the year as opposed to the first half.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And then your outlook for Merchant for the second half of the year, you sort of noted that would be better in the third versus second or sequential basis. But will you be able to generate some volume growth? Is that the assumption for the second half? Or is it still going to be kind of tough to do that in this environment?
M. Scott Crocco: Well, it is. So we are assuming that -- recall that in the first half of the year, there's more holidays. You've got Christmas in Q1. You've got Lunar New Year in the second quarter. So as we move into the second half of the year, in general, we have a stronger Q3 and Q4, let's call it seasonality. And then on top of it, we're also anticipating a sequentially improving economic environment, both of which will drive volume increases, as well as the impacts from our new signings coming on stream.
John E. McGlade: Yes, this is John. Just following up with a very quick wrap-up. I wanted to just make the points again, that we do have a strong backlog of projects with numerous opportunities for growth in those projects. We have significant leverage on our existing assets that leave us well positioned for a recovery, and we remain sharply focused on productivity, improving our core businesses and delivering on our cash priorities. You'll have the opportunity to go to our website for a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. And I'd like to just thank you on behalf of the management team for joining us in having a great day. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Gwen. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' First Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. I'm pleased to be joined today by Paul Huck, our CFO. As we announced in October, Paul will be retiring at the end of February. I'm also pleased to be joined by Scott Crocco, who will succeed Paul as CFO. Paul will review our overall Q1 results, I will review the segments and Scott will provide our outlook for Q2 and the rest of 2013. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start by saying it's been a pleasure working with all of you over the past 9 years. I will truly miss it. Let's turn to our results for the quarter on Slide #3. Our overall earnings per share results were in the top half of our expectations. However, softer-than-expected economic growth in the U.S., a deeper contraction than expected in Europe and continued soft volumes in China and a weaker electronics market prevented volumes from growing as much as we had hoped. Despite the weaker economic environment, we continue to take actions to improve our businesses. Pricing held firm. We are almost complete with our Europe restructuring actions, and our plants ran well. We also repurchased 5.7 million shares this quarter. We did this opportunistically when we saw the weakness in our share price in the fall. Our cash projections had us repurchasing shares later in our multiyear planning cycle. When we saw the weakness in the price, we decided to move the repurchase forward. Overall, we spent $462 million and paid an average price of $80.69 per share. We still have a little under $500 million left in our repurchase authorization. Our cash priorities remain the same, investing in good high-return projects, increasing our dividend each year and maintaining our A bond rating. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 10% higher versus prior year, with the Indura and DA NanoMaterials acquisitions contributing 6%. On an underlying basis, sales were up 4% on higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases segment across all regions. Our Equipment and Energy segment and our Performance Materials business also posted strong year-on-year volume improvement. Not surprisingly, this was partially offset by weakness in our European Merchant and Electronics businesses. Sequentially, overall sales declined 2%, with underlying sales down 4% on seasonally lower volumes across the Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials segments and lower activity in Equipment and Energy. Simon will provide more segment and geographic details later. Operating income of $372 million increased 5% versus prior year and decreased 9% sequentially. Our operating margin of 14.5% was down 70 basis points versus prior year, mainly due to the impact of inventory accounting revaluation, higher pension costs and the Indura acquisition. Excluding these impacts, operating margin would have been up 50 basis points, primarily due to our European cost reduction and improved plant operating efficiencies. This quarter, we had some larger-than-normal impacts flow through our P&L related to inventory accounting and not related to cash or inventory levels. In our year-end balance sheet, we adjust our inventory to actual costs for the year. During the year, we use standard costs for our inventory. This necessitates an adjustment at the beginning of the year to move from the previous year actual cost to our new standards. Typically, this adjustment is not large, as the prior year actual and the new standard are usually close to one another. For example, last year, the total adjustment was $2 million favorable. This year, however, the adjustment was $10 million unfavorable due to the following actions taken to lower cost and improve our Electronics and Performance Materials business. First, we moved to in-house production for a product which we had previously purchased. Our in-house production cost is much lower, therefore, our standard cost is lower than the cost we used at the end of 2012. Second, given the slow demand, we have been able to negotiate a number of price decreases for raw materials in 2013. This also lowers our standard cost versus our cost used at year end. Both items are positive for the business but produce a current period P&L expense to reflect the adjustments to the carrying value of the inventory. As we go through the year, we should recover these expenses as the products are sold at higher margins. Sequentially, our margins declined 120 basis points primarily due to seasonally lower volumes and higher pension costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up 3% versus last year. Our return on capital employed of 11.2% was lower due to our higher capital spending, acquisition and lower asset loadings. Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share of $1.30 increased by $0.04 versus last year. Volumes increased earnings per share by $0.12, including $0.07 from acquisitions. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together decreased earnings per share by $0.03 due to higher raw material and energy prices. Net cost performance was $0.05 unfavorable. Base business costs were $0.08 positive, primarily from the impact of our European cost reduction and improved plant operating efficiencies. This was more than offset by inflation, inventory revaluation impacts and higher pension costs. Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together were $0.02 favorable. Equity affiliate income and noncontrolling interest taken together was $0.01 higher. Interest expense was $0.02 higher due to acquisitions and our share repurchases. A higher tax rate this year reduced earnings per share by $0.02. Our tax rate guidance for the year remains unchanged at approximately 25%. And finally, lower shares outstanding contributed $0.01. Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 14% versus prior year, driven by the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were down 1% on 3% lower volumes and 2% positive price. Sales were down 1% sequentially, underlying sales were down 2% on 1% positive price and 3% lower volumes due to seasonality. Merchant Gases operating income of $171 million was up 3% versus prior year and up 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 16.9% was down 180 basis points compared to last year but up 110 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on the benefits from our Europe cost reduction programs and profits from the Indura acquisition, partially offset by lower volumes, particularly in our Europe packaged gas business. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the Indura business. We continue to see solid growth in the base business and are excited about a number of small on-site opportunities that bring together Indura's local knowledge and our on-site expertise. As we have said, given Indura's large hardgoods business, their margins are in the low double digits, about what we expected but below the Merchant segment average. For the quarter, Indura negatively impacted segment margins by about 80 basis points. Margins were also impacted by the lower volumes and higher pension costs. Versus prior quarter, we did see the expected seasonal volume weakness and higher pension costs, but improved productivity and prior quarter Indura acquisition costs improved margins. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In U.S./Canada, sales were up 2% on 1% higher volumes and 1% higher price. Liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen volumes were up on strength in chemicals, foods and metals. We continue to be successful bringing contract signings onstream, and new signings this quarter were well above prior year. Lost business this quarter was at more typical historical levels, much lower than we had been seeing recently. Helium availability has improved since last summer, but helium volumes are still down versus prior year and below our expectations due to supply constraints. We expect to get feedstock to bring our new Wyoming facility onstream late this fiscal year and expect helium to remain tight until at least then. We are also pursuing additional global opportunities to increase our helium supply. Argon availability improved as we worked hard to increase production and also saw softer demand. Pricing continues to be favorable led by helium, and LOX/LIN capacity utilization remained in the low 70s. In Europe, sales were down 6% versus last year. Underlying sales were down 4% on 5% lower volumes and 1% positive price as we continued to successfully implement increases. Currency had a negative 2% impact. LOX/LIN volumes were stronger in U.K., Ireland and Central Europe, but weaker in Southern Europe and the Northern Continent. Packaged gas volumes were weak across the region, and helium volumes were down on supply availability. Despite the weaker demand environment, pricing continued to be positive, up 1%, led by strength in helium. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the high 70s, and new contract signings were up versus last year. In Asia, sales were up 5% versus last year. Underlying sales were up 2% on flat volumes and 2% higher price. Currency had a positive 3% effect. LOX/LIN volumes, excluding conversions, were up 2% across the region and up 4% in China. Similar to last quarter, liquid argon volumes were down significantly on lower steel, wholesale and PV demand in China. Packaged gas cylinder volume growth was moderated by customer profitability actions. However, we continue to see good growth in our Microbulk product line. Pricing was up 2% on strength in helium, plant loadings remain in the mid-70s and new contract signings for the quarter were up over last year and last quarter. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $898 million were up 11% versus last year on strong 13% volume growth. Base volumes contributed about half of the growth, with particular strength on the U.S. Gulf Coast where our new pipeline connection enabled us to support increased customer spot demand as our competitor had short-term capacity challenges. Air Products' new projects onstream this quarter include our hydrogen plant in Detroit for Marathon and the Petrochina ASU. As we announced last quarter, we are exiting our polyurethane intermediates business and have shut down our Pasadena PUI facility. We will be reporting PUI in continuing operations as we establish a buyer-resale arrangement to serve customers through the end of their contracts, but we will help you understand the impact of changes in the PUI business. For the quarter, sales were down less than $10 million versus prior year, and operating income was relatively flat as we gave price relief last year to a customer. For the full year, we expect PUI sales to be down about $150 million, more than we previously communicated, as one of our remaining customers is not currently operating their facility. We still expect about a negative $0.05 EPS impact for the year, unchanged from our previous guidance. For the segment, sequentially, sales were up 6% on 4% higher volumes and a positive 4% impact of higher energy pass-through. Currency had a 1% positive impact, while PUI was negative 3%. Operating income of $138 million was up 24% versus prior year on the strong demand, better operating performance and lower maintenance spending at our facilities. Operating income was down 2% sequentially, primarily due to the PUI business. Operating margin of 15.4% was up 160 basis points versus prior year on higher volumes and lower maintenance. Margin declined 130 basis points sequentially on lower PUI results and higher natural gas prices. In October, we dedicated the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline system, stretching from the Houston Ship Channel in Texas to New Orleans, Louisiana. The new pipeline connects our Texas and Louisiana systems, creating a 600-mile pipeline with over 20 hydrogen sources, and increases the reliability and flexibility of our hydrogen supply, which is critical to our customers along the pipeline. The pipeline helped us supply spot opportunities as we can move product as needed, as well as use the pipe capacity itself to respond more quickly to changes in demand. We also announced a new long-term hydrogen agreement with OCI Beaumont to supply approximately 25 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen from our system to OCI's integrated methanol and ammonia plant in Beaumont, Texas. In addition to these near-term and longer-term volume benefits, we also saw improved system efficiency as we can manage the system to optimize the most efficient plants. In November, we announced an agreement to expand our syngas separation unit in Geismar, Louisiana to increase the supply of carbon monoxide, primarily for BASF's new world-scale formic acid plant in Geismar. This expansion will also provide additional hydrogen for our Gulf Coast pipeline system. Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $549 million were up 3% versus last year, driven by the DA Nano acquisition. Underlying sales were down 1% on flat volumes and 1% lower prices. Sequentially, sales were down 11% on 11% lower volumes. Versus prior year, Electronics sales were flat, with the DA Nano acquisition offsetting weaker materials volumes and lower equipment sales. Sales were down 15% sequentially on weaker seasonal materials volumes and significantly lower equipment sales. With the lower demand and some increase in competitive pressure, electronics materials pricing did see some negative impact but still remained relatively stable. Silane, driven by very weak PV markets, continues to be an exception. Performance Materials sales were up 6% versus last year as we saw strong volume growth across all 3 regions. Prices were slightly negative, but this was offset by lower raw material costs. Sequentially, PMD sales were down 4% on the expected seasonal slowdown. Operating income of $61 million was down 22% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 340 basis points to 11.2%. Paul discussed the inventory accounting revaluation. At the segment level, we had a negative effect from inventory accounting revaluation this quarter and a positive effect in the prior year. Excluding this impact from both quarters, operating income was down $3 million or 4%, and operating margin was down 100 basis points. x inventory, operating income was down, primarily driven by the weaker electronic materials demand and higher costs. Sequentially, operating income was down 28%, and operating margin was down 260 basis points on the lower volumes and higher costs. In Electronics, we announced another ultra-high purity nitrogen expansion and a further extension of our pipeline in the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan. This is in addition to the new contract announced in September to expand capacity for UMC's Phase 5 to 8 expansion. The new expansion will add 2 air separation units to the system that has been successfully serving electronics customers in Tainan for over 15 years. Air Products also serves electronics customers via pipeline networks in the U.S., Korea and China. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $106 million were up 19% versus prior year, primarily on higher project activity across the business. Sequentially, sales were down 16%, primarily due to lower ASU project activity. Operating income of $8 million was up 15% versus prior year on the higher activity. Sequentially, income was down 53% on the lower sales and higher project development costs. Backlog is up 25% over last year and down 14% versus last quarter as ASU bidding has slowed, while LNG project development continues to be strong. Consistent with our previous outlook, we still expect Equipment and Energy to provide a $0.05 tailwind for the full year as we expect improvement from new LNG orders starting in Q2. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.
M. Scott Crocco: Thanks, Simon. Now please turn to Slide 10, and let me provide you a brief summary of our outlook. From an economic perspective, we still expect modest but improving growth in FY '13, with global manufacturing at the low end of our 2% to 4% range. In the U.S., inventory de-stocking and fiscal cliff concerns negatively impacted manufacturing in the first quarter. The pending debt ceiling and spending debates add to uncertainty, which depresses hiring and investment and lowers consumer confidence. Going forward, we expect slow but modestly improving growth, driven in part by the recovering housing market and the Fed monetary policy. In any scenario, reduced government spending will lower 2013 growth. So overall for the year, we expect U.S./Canada growth to be close to the low end of our 2% to 4% range. Europe is in a recession now, and we are forecasting slow improvement through the rest of the year. In China and throughout Asia, there were some positive signs in manufacturing in Q1 driven by stimulus spending. We expect to see the benefits of this in the second half of the year. In electronics, industry production is weaker than last year, and fab utilization has softened. We expect this to slowly begin to recover in the second quarter. Our full year EPS guidance is $5.70 to $5.90, up $0.05 from our previous guidance, with the positive impact of the share repurchase partially offset by the slower economic environment going forward. CapEx is expected to be about $2 billion, consistent with the more focused guidance we gave in November. And our backlog is at $2.8 billion, down slightly from last quarter, as we brought onstream a number of projects. As we have said in the past, it is not unusual for the backlog to move around quarter-to-quarter. We still see robust bidding in the oxygen-for-gasification market in China but continue to see decisions being delayed for potential hydrogen and electronics projects. For Q2, our EPS guidance is $1.34 to $1.39 based on the following factors: On the positive side, we expect to see improved volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Equipment and Energy businesses; no inventory revaluation impact; the increasing positive effect of our cost-reduction programs; and a full quarter effect of our Q1 share buyback. Partially offsetting the sequential improvement, Tonnage Gases profits are expected to decline due to seasonally higher maintenance spending and lower volumes as refineries begin taking their annual outages. We also expect reduced spot sales on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The PUI business and the impact of Lunar New Year are also expected to be headwinds. Now let me wrap up. Overall, Q1 gives us a good start to the year, with solid execution in an uncertain economic environment. We are taking actions to control our own destiny, including efficient plant operations, cost-reduction programs, price improvement and excellent project execution. We are well positioned to grow in the long term with the size and strength of our backlog, over 80% of which is committed to long-term, on-site or pipeline contracts. We have significant leverage on our existing assets to load them as the economy recovers. And we are focused on our core business and cash priorities. And finally, on behalf of John McGlade and the rest of Air Products, I would like to personally thank Paul for all he's done over his 33 years with Air Products, especially the last 9 as CFO. Paul hired me into the company, and I have worked either directly for him or in his organization for all of my 22 years with Air Products. While I have some big shoes to fill, I plan to approach my new role with the same integrity, transparency and passion that Paul has and to continue to focus on driving long-term profitable growth for Air Products by increasing returns and ensuring capital discipline consistent with our cash priorities. I enjoyed the opportunity to get out and meet a number of you in December, and I look forward to getting out again very soon as we finalize the CFO transition in late February. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Gwen to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes, 2 questions actually. On the inventory revaluation in Electronics, I know in the past there's been offsets to -- within the corporate line. Did that occur this time? And am I correct in saying or in understanding that you expect to reverse this as the year goes on? And then just secondly, how much of the European $60 million of restructuring did you get? I think you had $40 million left to come there.
M. Scott Crocco: I'll take the second, Paul, if you take the first.
Paul E. Huck: Okay, yes. On the inventory, Don, there is some offset which occurs in the -- in there, but there are impacts which occur in the Merchant area also. And those -- and that offset is really around what occurs on the LIFO accounting, and the bulk of that is offset against the Merchant area for us in this quarter. So there is a small impact there. But for the large part, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, that flowed directly through to the bottom line in the consolidated results.
M. Scott Crocco: And the second question, Don -- this is Scott. In terms of the Europe restructuring, we're on track to wrap that up by the end of the second quarter. And we saw in this quarter about a $0.03 benefit. And as we take the actions then going forward, we expect to have that step up modestly in the second quarter and then to get to a run rate of about $0.05 per quarter, $60 million or so on an annualized basis. So consistent with what we've said in the past, we would expect to see in fiscal '13 about a $0.15 favorable impact from the cost-reduction actions in Europe.
Operator: And we'll go next to P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Can you talk about your utilization rates in Merchant business by region? And given some low rates, is there any possibility of consolidation of merchant facilities in any region that you can do?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. Great, P.J., good question. So let me just go over the numbers that we talked about. So for the U.S./Canada -- and again, these are our LOX/LIN utilization rates. So in the U.S./Canada, the low 70s; in the Europe, high 70s; and in Asia, in the mid-70s. And I think one of the things that as I know you know in this business, we have a very modest distribution radius for product out of these plants, perhaps 100 miles. And so in that environment, it gets very difficult to create value just by shutting down capacity. It's certainly something that we look at on an ongoing basis, but it isn't really one of our expectations for one of the big drivers going forward. We are working hard to bring load to those facilities. We're doing that in a disciplined manner relative to pricing with our applications expertise and loading up our sales teams. So as we said, that's one of our big opportunities going forward as those assets load up.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So I understand that -- sorry, go ahead.
Paul E. Huck: P.J., I think the thing is, as Simon said, our pricing has been good in most regions here as we go through. And so we don't think the utilization rate is impacting pricing.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: No, I understand that you don't transport gases in Merchant more than 100, 200 miles. But is there a way you can do piggybacking on on-site projects and then shut down some older merchant facilities?
Simon R. Moore: So I think anytime that we have an opportunity to do that, P.J., we would absolutely take a look at that. To be honest with you, in U.S./Canada, there's only a modest amount of new ASU on-site opportunities. So again, we look at that every time. I just -- I guess my point is I don't think that's going to be a huge driver of the growth going forward. I think more of an opportunity is to leverage the economic recovery that we're expecting to grow the volumes.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then secondly in electronics, there was a sequential decline. How much of that was seasonal? And then you talked about equipment decline, can you just talk about how much was equipment versus gases and chemicals?
M. Scott Crocco: So P.J., this is Scott. From a sequential in electronics, it's about half between equipment and materials and heavily driven from a materials perspective from seasonality.
Operator: We'll go next to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Could you talk a little bit more on -- you talked about electronics rebounding in your 2Q, or I assume that was your 2Q and not the calendar 2Q. What gives you the confidence in that at this point? And what signposts should we be looking for to know that that's actually happening?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. It's a good question, Vincent, thank you. I think a couple of things there. First of all, obviously, we just talked about the seasonal pattern, right, and we recognize Q1 as typically weak. We typically see improvement through the year. So I think, to some degree, you would expect a typical seasonal pattern. I think as we talked to some of our customers, that's the feedback that they're giving to us. They wouldn't be surprised to see utilization rates be a little bit soft here but then continue to improve through the back half of the year. And again, as we look at what some of our customers are talking about, they're also looking, for example, I think both Intel and TSMC have pretty robust capital spending expectations for this upcoming year of 2013, which obviously goes to one of the concepts we've been talking about, that the big, strong players in this industry are the ones who have the ability and the capacity to continue to invest in the new fabs, and those are the companies that we're the leading supplier to.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just as a separate follow-up to that. I believe in the 2Q guidance you gave, you were talking about sort of the annual outages in refineries as being a negative for this quarter, for your second quarter. And just help me understand, I mean, it's obviously -- there's got to be some mismatch between the size of the outages this year and last year and so forth, right, because otherwise, they're annual and there shouldn't really be a comparable issue. So what's the difference this year versus last year?
Paul E. Huck: As far as that's concerned with that, Vincent, is that in last year and this year, the outages are probably about the same from a maintenance standpoint. We had -- our plants ran better in Q1 of this year than they ran in Q1 of last year. And so we had some plant issues in Q1 of last year which we talked about at that point in time. We are over them, and so we had a very good first quarter in that. As you look at this, the high point for turnarounds is typically our quarter 2 for the refineries. There's also turns which occur in quarter 1 and quarter 3. There's not that many which occur in quarter 4, we think. So this is typically the high point for the maintenance activities which we would normally expect. The aberration was more in the prior year than in the current year.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And related to your own productivity versus the customer?
Paul E. Huck: For last year, yes.
Operator: And we'll go next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: When one reads accounts of Chile, there's a sense that electricity prices have really moved up. Can you give a sense of Indura's margins on a sequential or year-over-year basis and the volume growth pro forma year-over-year? How's that acquisition doing?
M. Scott Crocco: Jeff, this is Scott. The acquisition is doing very well. We're very pleased with the business that we've acquired, and we've seen all sorts of opportunities. I'll remind you, too, that this acquisition was -- we had some cost synergies, but it was heavy on -- from a growth perspective. And in the early days here, we've been able to identify several small on-site opportunities in steel and glass, and we're pursuing them. So we are very pleased with the acquisition. In terms of your question of margin, as we've said before, to be in the low teens, given that the nature of that business is more in the hardgoods. But we do see sequential growth not only from the markets that we're in, but also, as I've mentioned, from our offerings. And as we expand and identify more opportunities, both from small on-sites, as well as in the applications arena, we expect to see continued good growth. So we're very pleased with that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then your pension contribution, I think, was $320 million in the quarter. Are you...
Simon R. Moore: $230 million.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: $230 million, I misspoke. I'm sorry. Are you expecting to contribute under $300 million this year or what's your expectation?
M. Scott Crocco: Yes. So -- Scott again, Jeff, modestly up from the $230 million, won't be $300 million, $275 million or so for the year.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Scott and Paul, just on the backlog, I know it does move up and down. But would you expect the backlog at year end to be higher or lower than it was at the end of Q1?
M. Scott Crocco: I would say -- so this is Scott, Dave. As you mentioned, it's lumpy, especially as we've got more larger deals, China gasification and so forth. But I would expect it to end the year about where it is now, kind of bumping along but moving sideways. Again, a lot of good opportunities that we're out there looking at.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just Europe, Scott, I know it's been under a lot of scrutiny, restructuring and management changes. Has a corner been turned in Europe? And what's the margin potential in the European Merchant business from where it is today and where can it be in 2, 3 years if filings pick up and pricing holds?
M. Scott Crocco: So from a cost perspective, as I mentioned, we're running through and almost finalized with the provision. But I also say that we're focused on additional cost reductions beyond simply people reductions. We've got a lot of initiatives going on from a supply chain perspective, as well as trying to push price. And as you saw in our results, we do have prices up. So in terms of where could it get overall, we're looking at this and trying to make substantial, continued improvement, recognizing that the economy in the short term and for some time is not going to be a big tailwind. And so we're going to continue to drive the business and do what we need to do in order to get it profitable, both from price and cost. But hopeful, again, from a volume perspective, through applications and making sure that we're going after the right customers and the right locations to drive margin improvement.
Operator: And we'll go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Let me just add my thanks to Paul for all the years you've put in. Thank you.
Paul E. Huck: Thank you.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: When you look at the Asia volumes being flat, we've seen your competitor come out this morning with bigger numbers there now. Some of that may be new start-ups. DuPont yesterday was kind of talking about 8% sales growth in Asia. To be flat seems like one of the disappointing areas of this quarter. Can you kind of talk about what you think volumes are doing in Asia and kind of how you're doing relative to the market in Asia?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. Duffy, this is Simon. Good question. And of course, I know that you know one of the big differences is, when we talk about this region, we're just talking about our Merchant business, right, and whereas other people are talking about the impact of Asia of their whole company. So for example, if you had large tonnage plants starting up in Asia, they'd be included in the other guy's Asia comments but not in ours. And I know you know that. But just if I could then focus on what we've seen in Asia, couple of different things going on. We commented that argon has been particularly soft in Asia in our Merchant business. And you have a dynamic there of some of the steel companies who own their own air separation units. Sometimes, they need a little bit of extra argon. If they're not running as hard, they actually have a little bit of extra argon to put into the marketplace. So that has impacted our wholesale demand for argon, as well as soft photovoltaics market. Again, as we said, LOX/LIN volumes have been up x conversions about 2%. So that's a positive. Obviously, we're working hard to make that number larger. We've also seen a little bit of softness in our cylinder business in Asia. And as we commented, we've done some things to focus on the higher profitability customers, so have done a little bit of business-shedding there as well. So we do expect to see a pickup in economic activity and volume growth in the back half of our year in Asia, particularly in the Merchant business. And again, just as a reminder, we have a lot of significant asset investments in the Tonnage business that are expected to come onstream this year as well in Asia.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. And then the opportunity with the on-site businesses around Indura, roughly what are we talking, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000 tons per day? I mean, what's the cumulative opportunity over a 2- or 3-year period there look like?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And Duffy, this is Paul. If you take a look at that, the thing which we're looking at are what we would call the small generated gas type of plants. So typically, most of your opportunities there are going to be under 100 tons a day, but they turn out to be a good opportunity for us, very nice things which we do. And we are finding a lot of them principally because the business was focused on packaged gas previously. And so now as we bring our applications expertise into this country, we think we're going to be able to sell a number of these plants over the next few years.
Operator: And we'll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess following the sizable share repurchases in the first quarter, your net debt's up to about $5.4 billion or 2.2x to 2.3x trailing EBITDA. I guess 2 quick questions. First, how does that compare at this point to what you would consider optimal leverage? Is there room to take that higher? And related to that, did you purchase any additional shares in January? And would you care to venture any thoughts on the likely pace of execution on the remainder of the authorization?
Paul E. Huck: If you take a look at our leverage overall, right now, it's on the high side, so -- because we move the share buyback forward with those things for where we would like to run it. Now as far as buying back shares in January, no, we haven't. As far as a buyback in the future -- of this year, we would look at this from an opportunity standpoint. As you can see is that we bought the shares at a low price. If the stock does drop down, we would look at that again.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then second question if I may on Tonnage. Can you refresh us on projected start-ups in the March quarter, other projects that may be ramping if we're thinking about sequential contributions to growth?
Simon R. Moore: I'm sorry, yes. Sorry, Kevin. Yes. So we've updated our major projects slide in our package, and we do have some projects that we expect to come onstream here soon. So particularly in the second quarter, really the Yankuang project in China will come on stream. In the third quarter, we would expect to see PetroChina in China. That's, again, very exciting project, as it's the first steam methane reformer, the first hydrogen plant that's ever been outsourced by a state-owned oil company in China, so a great opportunity. And then we have some electronics projects that are expected to come onstream later in the year. So that's kind of the framework of how things look for the rest of the year.
Operator: And we'll go next to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Wanted to ask a question on the U.S. Merchant business. You guys had taken some lumps previously on the performance there, and you mentioned that the new signings were above the prior year and that your lost customers were below prior periods and more normal. Do you have a net win when it comes to new signings versus lost business?
Simon R. Moore: Yes, we do. Yes, absolutely, Bob. And I think I would just -- for the quarter, that is absolutely the case. We had a lot more new signings, lot more new business coming onstream. Obviously, when you look at the year-on-year comparison, right, we see some of the business that was lost through the second half of last year.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe a longer-term question. As we see shale gas continue to expand in the U.S. and the promise of a lot more light oil, does this diminish the hydrogen business at all? You've always talked about more heavy sour crude slates, but it looks like the U.S. market is maybe moving opposite to that. So how does that impact your business?
Paul E. Huck: As far as that is concerned, it depends where that goes. For right now, as we look at this, there's still a good amount of heavy crude which comes into the refiners, which they process. And it also gets around what sort of the product mix which they make. We've talked about this before, that as they tend to move more and more to more transportation fuels, even a light sweet crude, they wind up cracking that further down. So as the U.S. market, especially the Gulf Coast where we have a large presence, turns into more of a market for export, that -- and that's going to favor more use of hydrogen and principally, the export which is going out is diesel, which is the heaviest consumer of hydrogen in the mix.
Operator: And we'll go next to John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
Alina Khaykin : Yes. This is actually Alina Khaykin, sitting in for John. Quick question on the guidance. I believe you've raised the midpoint by a bit. So what has changed since last quarter? Is it more restructuring, is it the share repurchases or is it faster growth in some of the markets?
M. Scott Crocco: So this is Scott. If you look at the impact from the share repurchase, roughly $0.10 up from what the previous guidance was. But then given the economic situation that we're in and the environment that we saw in the first quarter, and as we talked about a decelerating momentum through the quarter, we've taken that down by about half, just given the uncertainty of the economic growth going forward. And so that's what translates into taking it up by about $0.05.
Alina Khaykin : Okay, got it. And then on Indura, how are you progressing towards the $20 million synergy target? And could there be upside from that?
M. Scott Crocco: As I mentioned before, we're progressing very well. And again, the cost synergies are relatively modest, driven more from a corporate governance and an oversight, and we're on track there. But really, this acquisition was driven by the top line growth synergies that we can bring, marrying their local knowledge in the hardgoods business with our application knowledge and on-sites. And so, as I mentioned before, very happy with the acquisition. It's running very well, and we look forward to continue to drive top line growth in that new market.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: Just looking at the Tonnage business, how much of that hydrogen spot volume growth do you think is sustainable and sort of driven or supported by the pipeline? And how much of that was more temporary, driven by the competitor issues that you referenced? And can you maybe address, while you're talking about the pipeline, any surprises, pleasant or otherwise, since the pipeline has been up and running for 4 or 5 months now?
Simon R. Moore: Great. Mike, good questions. So again, if we just kind of break down the Tonnage volume growth, we said about half of that was from new projects. So obviously, that's sustainable. The other half was from base business load-up. And I think of that base business load-up, probably half of that was increased volumes in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So to be honest with you, we call them spot volumes for a reason. There was an opportunity here where customers' demand exceeded their capacity to get product from somebody else. And we were extremely pleased that the pipeline enabled us to literally move product from one region to the other, support these customers in their time of need and also create a good opportunity for us. So one of the things we talked about in our sequential guidance going forward is we wouldn't be surprised if we saw a little bit of softening of some of those spot volumes. But again, those are exactly the opportunities and exactly the reason why we invested in the pipeline. In terms of the pipeline, I think things are going very well. The team's becoming very familiar with that and emphasizing how to best utilize it. We're getting the efficiency benefits that we expected out of it. And I would say probably, since it's come onstream, I would say the volume opportunities have perhaps exceeded our expectations as well. So things are going well down there.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And then just looking at the Merchant business, a couple of questions. One, how much of a headwind was helium under U.S./Canada Merchant volumes? And then can you give a little bit more detail on the LAR business in the U.S. and what steps you had to take in order to alleviate the supply constraints that you were facing?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. So I think as we've said a couple of times in terms of helium, but overall, as well as in the U.S./Canada, it was down in U.S./Canada. So it has a little bit of an impact on the top line. I think, overall, for the company, not much of an impact. And as we said before, given the teams out there working very hard to drive price increases, it has a very modest bottom line impact. In terms of argon, obviously, I think we talked about this at our event in November, some examples of where we're worked hard to improve the recovery of argon at certain plants and also improve the purification. So it's not one single project, it's a matter of getting a little bit more argon out of a few different locations. And again, I'd just also point out that we've seen a little bit of demand softening as well. So argon, really, I think we would say, generally speaking, was not a constraint during the quarter.
Operator: And we'll go next to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: This is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Just going back to Europe, you mentioned that Europe is in a recession. But have you seen any signs of a stabilization or conversely, are any regions within getting worse?
M. Scott Crocco: This is Scott. So we actually saw in the first quarter a deceleration and a bigger impact from the holiday slowdown. Now early on, we're just partially way through January, we have seen that turn, and we are hopeful that as we get past the holiday slowdown, that we see sequential growth not only in the second quarter, but then through the rest of the fiscal year. In our forecast, we anticipate that for the full year, we get back about even, slightly unfavorable overall from a manufacturing output in Europe.
Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then you mentioned briefly in your prepared remarks, but can you talk about which projects and regions you're seeing customers scale back on CapEx? And are you seeing an increased reluctance on behalf of these customers to sign larger contracts given the uncertainty?
Paul E. Huck: And so as far as that's concerned, we said the gasification area in China is still plowing forward, so we're seeing contracts occur there. Then if we turn to the hydrogen contracts in the U.S. and around the world and also if we turn to electronics, we are seeing customers hold back. Certainly, within the U.S., investment plans are holding back somewhat because of the uncertainty around tax rules and things like that, which are holding back things.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mark Gulley with BGC Financial.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: I want to talk a little bit about what's happening in Algeria. Is the unrest there hurting your ability to get helium recoveries from the facility there, and whether or not you're seeing any pressure on future LNG projects due to political uncertainty in that region?
Paul E. Huck: As far as that's concerned, Mark, we haven't seen an impact on our plants for helium in Algeria. The place where this occurs is pretty far from our plant, with that is concerned. But it's a situation which we obviously watch, and we want to be able to get people and to have the country still work and be able to ship product out. So we'll watch that. As far as the impact on future LNG projects, I don't think anyone -- I don't think the situation here is going to have a single impact here on people looking at LNG projects. They know the Middle East is a tough place to operate. They've operated there for years with these projects, so I'd still see projects going forward. The other thing is that a lot of the development on LNG right now is really occurring in the Australia area and Indonesia area.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, on the structure of the balance sheet and leverage, I do applaud your share repurchase plan and that sort of thing. But if I look at your cash flow statement, it appears as if you're having to borrow to pay the dividend, that is your free cash flow is not quite supportive of the full dividend payment. Is that something that would concern you, Scott? And how should I think about maybe the potential for future dividend increases if I'm right on my logic?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. Mark, I'll let Scott speak on this. One of the things which you got to realize here is that as we invest capital, new capital for growth, we do increase our borrowing activity. So it looks like we are going to borrow to pay a dividend. In actuality, we are leveraging our product -- our projects as they go in. We make an equity contribution and a debt investment in these things -- for those things. And so -- and that depends upon the type of project. Certainly, an on-site project, which we're seeing a lot of our projects being right now, we're putting a lot more debt against those projects for us. In general, I don't see this concerning us going forward as far as the structure of the balance sheet.
M. Scott Crocco: But just to build on that, obviously, the focus going forward is going to be expand margins and bring those projects onstream, on time and profitably, load the assets, and so looking to generate more cash out of the investments that we've made through margin expansion.
Operator: And we'll go next to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Nice start to the year, and have fun there, Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Mike. I will.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of Tonnage, you had a nice start to the year. Any changes to the outlook for the contribution for earnings this year? Is it still the same? Is there a potential for upsides, a little bit early to tell maybe?
Paul E. Huck: Well, on Tonnage -- and they have had a good start to the year. You're right, poor thing. I think towards the top end of the range, you're going to look at that as one of the things which is going to drive us there. So perhaps as we look at the full year that -- and that we have business which is going well, and we hope is continue to go well.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then second question in terms of the outlook for silicon growth, you were at mid-single digits at the beginning of your fiscal year. Any changes to that? Maybe give us a feel for how the first quarter went so we can see how that's expected to unfold as the year progresses?
M. Scott Crocco: So this is Scott. In general, no change, but we would expect it to be a little at the bottom end of that range that we gave before.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I was just wondering if you could quantify the maintenance impact this quarter. And just -- is this a factor, as you talked about before, where it was different last year than it is this year and therefore, there's the year-to-year impact as opposed to being significantly higher this quarter? Or was it just higher this quarter for some reason?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. If you take a look at that, the impact was about $0.03 a share for us versus the prior year...
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Right. I'm sorry, it was lower this quarter $0.03 relative to...
Paul E. Huck: In this quarter against the prior year, that's right. And as I said, it was the prior year amount of spending which we didn't expect going into the quarter 1 of last year, but we had about $0.03 a share which was favorable year-over-year.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. So having said that, as we move forward, the level we're at now is a more normal level, is that what you're saying?
Paul E. Huck: No. I think as we move forward, so if we go into quarter 2, right, as we look at quarter 2, quarter 2 is going to be down in the Tonnage area because of increased maintenance, which comes about by the turnarounds. And we get -- and not only the cost impact, but we also get the volume impact of that flowing through also.

[Operator Instructions] Also, this telephone conference presentation and the comments made on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. Air Products will be recording this teleconference and may publish all or a portion of the teleconference. No other recording or redistribution of this telephone conference by any other party are permitted without the express written permission of Air Products. Your participation indicates your agreement. Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. I'm pleased to be joined today by John McGlade, our CEO; and Paul Huck, our CFO. John will first provide our overall perspective on the year, Paul will review our 2012 and Q4 results, I will review the segment results, Paul will provide an outlook for Q1 and 2013 and finally, John will provide some longer-term perspectives. Our comments today are slightly longer than normal so we would ask you to limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up, please. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to John.
John E. McGlade: Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I share my perspective on the year, I did want to make a few comments. As you've seen from our earlier announcement, Paul has decided to retire from Air Products at the end of February. After 33 years of exemplary service to this organization, he has decided now is the right time to step back and spend more time with family and on other endeavors. Paul has been with Air Products since 1979 and has served as our Chief Financial Officer since 2004. Over that time, he has exemplified the best of everything we stand for. He has seen this company grow tremendously during his tenure and has been a key player in every step of the way as a leader, mentor and trusted colleague. I think I speak for the entire Air Products' Board of Directors and the entire Air Products community when I say he will be greatly missed. Paul will remain with Air Products through February in order to transition his role to Scott Crocco. Scott has been at Air Products for 22 years and has extensive experience in all areas of finance, including serving as the financial manager for many of our businesses. Scott currently serves as Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. I know that Paul plans to introduce Scott to many of you over the coming weeks and months so that you'll have the chance to get to know him as he moves into his new role. While we are sorry to be losing Paul, we understand his decision and have every confidence in Scott's ability to help take this organization forward. Now please turn to Slide #3 for a review of the key highlights from our fiscal year 2012. Let me begin by saying the global economy certainly proved to be more challenging than we expected for 2012, and we did not see the anticipated step up in economic growth in the second half of our fiscal year. To summarize, for the year, we saw global manufacturing growth of about 3%, toward the low end of our planning range. This obviously impacted our volume growth, particularly in our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. During the year, we did take important steps to position our portfolio for future success. We sold our European Homecare business and implemented a significant restructuring program to bring our costs in line with a slower economy in Europe. And as we announced this morning, we are exiting our polyurethane intermediates business and are restructuring our photovoltaic business to reflect current market conditions. Paul will provide more details on these actions shortly. We continue to execute on acquisition opportunities to support our strategies. In July, we closed on the purchase of a majority position in Indura, the largest independent gas company in Latin America. This year, we also invested in a 25% position in Abdullah Hashim Group, the largest industrial gas company in Saudi Arabia. And this week, we announced a complementary joint venture with ACWA, the Arabian company for power and water development, to focus on large-scale industrial gas opportunities within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Finally, we purchased the remaining 50% of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture. We also continue to be successful in winning profitable projects in the key energy, environmental and emerging markets. Our 2012 capital expenditure was a record $2.8 billion, including significant wins in oxygen for coal gasification in China. We are now executing 6 projects in this exciting growth market, totaling over 28,000 tons per day of oxygen. Bidding activity remains strong as these projects are driven by China's drive for energy independence. We completed the world's largest hydrogen pipeline network in the United States Gulf Coast. This system allows us to offer customers the highest levels of reliability and flexibility while enabling us to optimize the energy cost and volumes from the system. As one example, Motiva awarded us a significant new hydrogen deal, in part due to the flexibility created by the pipeline, demonstrating again the competitive advantage this pipeline gives us. We continue to win key on-site projects in our Electronics business, notably with Samsung for their large new complex in Xi'an, China; and UMC for their growth in Tainan, Taiwan. In the energy area, we announced new LNG orders in Malaysia and Australia, and we announced the exciting new energy from waste project in Tees Valley, United Kingdom. This project leverages our on-site business model and our significant operating experience to create a renewable source of energy for the U.K. market. And very importantly, we increased our dividend for the 30th consecutive year, something we are very proud of. While I'm pleased with these key actions, I am disappointed by our earnings growth in 2012. We simply must improve our performance in 2013 and beyond. We have increased the number of resources focused on loading existing capacity, and we continue to step up resources devoted to delivering additional productivity in our fixed and variable costs. To be clear, we aren't relying on improved economic conditions. We are committed to actions we can control that will deliver improving results in the near term. Paul will now review our 2012 results.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide #4. Before we get into the operating results, I want to spend a moment reviewing a few items with you. The first 2 are focused on our portfolio restructuring efforts. First, we decided to exit our polyurethane intermediates business and have shut down our Pasadena, Texas polyurethane intermediates production facility, resulting in an after-tax charge of $35 million or $0.16 per share. Polyurethane intermediates was one of our legacy chemicals businesses that we've been running for cash for a number of years. We have established a buy/resell arrangement with the buyer of the business to serve the 2 remaining supply contracts, the largest of which expires at the end of 2013. As a result, we would expect a negative fiscal year '13 revenue impact of about $100 million and a negative EPS impact of about $0.05. Also during the fourth quarter, we completed an assessment of our position in the photovoltaic market, resulting in an after-tax charge of $127 million or $0.59 per share, primarily within our electronics business. Consistent with the external market forecast, we had anticipated significant demand growth for thin film, or Gen2 solar panels. To support this market, we entered into a long-term take or pay supply agreement in 2009 for the purchase of xylene gas. For a variety of reasons, the thin-film PV market did not develop as the industry expected, resulting in global xylene capacity of about 4x to 5x global demand. We are in negotiations to terminate our xylene contract. This charge reflects estimated termination charges, loss on purchase commitments and the write-down of production and distribution assets, inventory and accounts receivable. Further details on these 2 items are available in the footnotes to the earnings release. Finally, we also recorded an after-tax charge of $6 million, or $0.03 per share, to write down our assets at Sparrows Point, Maryland, related to a customer bankruptcy and mill closure. The facility served the steel mill as well as the merchant market with a piggyback liquefier. The assets cannot be redeployed for alternative use. Excluding these 3 items, our adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations is $1.42 for the quarter, at the low end of our $1.42 to $1.47 guidance range and up slightly versus last year and last quarter. To help you with the quarterly comparisons, Slide #18 in the appendix shows earnings per share from continuing operations x disclosed items for the last 2 years. As John mentioned, we closed on the purchase of 65% of Indura in July, so the fourth quarter includes a full quarter of Indura results. 100% of Indura is included in our merchant results, with the profits from the portion we don't own eliminated from the P&L in the noncontrolling interest line. Our integration efforts are progressing well, and we are on track to deliver on our expected cost synergies and growth opportunities. Regarding the remaining European Homecare business located in the U.K. and Ireland, we have received bids from interested parties, and we hope to close on the sale of the remaining business before the end of calendar year 2012. As an update to our Q2 European restructuring, we continue to make good progress on our cost reduction plan and, in fact, saw about $6 million of benefit in the past quarter, making the total for 2012 about $10 million of benefit, consistent with our plans. When fully implemented in 2013, we expect the cost reduction plan to provide $60 million of annual savings. Now please turn to Slide #5 for a review of our 2012 results. Sales of $9.6 billion were down 1%. Currency and energy pass-through were both negative 2%, while acquisitions added 2%. Our underlying sales grew 1% from higher tonnage volumes being partially offset by weakness across our Merchant segment, particularly in Europe. Overall, volume growth was much more modest than we had hoped. While this is primarily due to a weak macroenvironment, particularly in Europe and Asia, we are not pleased with our performance to load our plants. In our Merchant segment, overall volumes were down 2%. Volume growth of 6% in Tonnage Gases principally came from new investments and contracts. In Electronics, growth in on-site and equipment was offset by lower specialty materials demand. Our operating income of $1.5 billion declined 1%, and our operating margin for the year was 16%. Earnings per share were up 1%. And not surprisingly, given our higher capital spending, weak asset loading and acquisitions this past year, our after-tax return on capital employed declined by 100 basis points to 11.5%, still well above our 8% cost of capital. Now let's turn to our results for the quarter on Slide #6. Overall results were within our expectations. However, again, weaker economic growth prevented volumes from growing as much as we had forecast, and we had headwinds from the stronger dollar. Despite this weaker environment, pricing held firm. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 4% higher versus prior year in total. On an underlying basis, sales were also up 4% on higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases, Equipment and Energy and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Our Indura and DA NanoMaterials acquisitions contributed 6%, which was offset by unfavorable currency and lower energy pass-through impacts. Sequentially, overall sales grew 11%. Underlying sales increased 3% on higher volumes across all segments. Additionally, the Indura acquisition contributed 6%. Simon will provide segment and geographic details later. Operating income of $408 million increased 3% versus prior year and prior quarter. Our operating margin of 15.7% was down slightly versus prior year. The impact of the acquisition and associated costs was a negative 50 basis points. Sequentially, our margins declined 130 basis points due to the Indura acquisition, higher energy prices and higher operating and distribution costs. Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up modestly versus last year and sequentially. Turning to Slide #7 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations' earnings per share of $1.42 increased by $0.01 versus last year. Volumes increased earnings per share by $0.05, including $0.06 from acquisitions. And as a reminder, last year's fourth quarter included $0.05 of good news from tonnage contract modifications, which did not repeat this year. Let me take a minute and talk about the overall impact of Indura. Indura sales were about $140 million this quarter, or a run rate of about 10% higher in local currency terms than the March -- last 12 months' net numbers we communicated when we announced the deal in June. Within the Merchant segment, we had about $6 million of transaction cost, with another $5 million of one-time financing cost captured in the interest expense line. Overall, given the acquisition cost and consistent with what we communicated last quarter, Indura was about a $0.03 headwind for us this quarter. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together increased earnings per share by $0.01. Positive cost performance was $0.02 favorable. Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together were $0.03 unfavorable. Equity affiliate income and noncontrolling interest taken together were neutral. As a reminder, last year, we disclosed $0.04 of good news in our equity affiliate lines from non-operational items, which was offset by an accounting adjustment of a similar amount in noncontrolling interest. What you see here is essentially the reversal of that trend -- of that item as a prior year variance. And finally, interest expense was $0.04 higher due to the Indura acquisition. Now for a review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 8, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 8% versus prior year, primarily driven by the Indura acquisition. Underlying sales were down 3% on 4% lower volumes and 1% positive price. The volume effect on sales was impacted by contract modifications in the prior year in U.S./Canada. Excluding that effect, volumes would have been down 2%. We also had a 4% negative currency impact. Sales were up 16% sequentially, again primarily driven by Indura. Underlying sales were up 1% on a 1% volume improvement and flat pricing, and currency had a negative 1% effect. Merchant Gases' operating income of $161 million was down 5% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 15.8% was down 210 basis points compared to last year and down 300 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was down on lower volumes, particularly helium and Europe packaged gases and negative currency. Partially offsetting this were benefits from our Europe cost reduction programs and profits from the Indura acquisition. Excluding Indura, the operating margin this quarter would have been 17.2% or 140 basis points higher. As we discussed when we announced the Indura acquisition, their operating margins are below our Merchant segment average due to approximately half of their sales being in lower-margin hard goods. As Paul said, the Merchant Q4 segment results include about $6 million of one-time acquisition costs. Excluding the acquisition costs, Indura's margins were in the low double-digits, about what we expected. Versus prior quarter, we did see the negative impact of higher power costs and lower ASU plant output with the higher summer temperatures. And we saw higher distribution costs, particularly in North America, due to tight helium and argon supply. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In U.S./Canada, sales were down 6% on lower volumes and flat pricing. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen volumes were down slightly. While we are successfully bringing onstream the business we previously signed, we are seeing a number of customers shut down operations or stop using gases and, in a few cases, switched to competitive supply. Helium availability remains a challenge, and helium volumes were down as both domestic and overseas sources did not supply as expected. We hope to get feedstock to bring our new Wyoming facility onstream late in our fiscal year 2013 and expect helium to remain tight until at least then. Paul mentioned the shutdown of the Sparrows Point facility. As we discussed last quarter, this impacted our argon availability. We are working hard to improve argon recovery at other facilities. For example, we recently moved quickly to redeploy an idle asset to a facility in a region with supply shortages. Overall, if we had the helium and argon we had expected, and excluding the impact of the contract modifications, U.S./Canada volumes would have been up 1% rather than down 6%. Pricing was flat, with helium increases offsetting slightly lower LOX/LIN/LAR pricing. Contract signings stayed at the high level we saw through the first 3 quarters and are up 15% versus last year. And LOX/LIN capacity utilization remained in the low 70s. In Europe, sales were down 12% versus last year, primarily due to currency, with underlying sales down 3%. Volumes were down 4% on weaker demand for both packaged gases and liquid/bulk, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Helium volumes were down on supply availability. Despite the weaker demand environment, pricing remained positive, up 1%. LOX/LIN plant reloadings remain in the low 80s, and new contract signings were at target. In Asia, sales were down 1% versus last year. Underlying sales were flat on 2% positive price and 2% lower volumes as we are clearly seeing effect of lower demand, particularly in China in electronics. LOX/LIN volumes, excluding conversions, were up 2%. Liquid argon volumes were down significantly, particularly on lower PV demand in China. One bright spot was the continued success of our Microbulk product line. Despite the slower growth environment, pricing was up 2% on positive packaged gas and flat liquid/bulk pricing. Plant loadings were in the mid-70s. And new contract signings for the quarter were down slightly, but we finished the year well ahead of last year. We continue to demonstrate application technology successes, helping our customers use our products to reduce environmental emissions, increase output and improve product quality, among other benefits. We announced a new contract to provide a full oxy-fuel solution to Jinxin Glass in Henan, China, including our PRISM VSA oxygen generator and Cleanfire oxy-fuel burners. And we announced an order to provide similar systems to 5 CEMEX cement factories in Spain. Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases' sales of $846 million were down 4% versus last year, driven by a negative 7% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 2% impact from currency. Volumes were up 5%, about evenly split between base volume growth and new projects. Sequentially, sales were up 10%, with 4% higher volumes and a positive 6% impact of higher energy pass-through. Operating income of $141 million was down 7% versus prior year. The volume growth and lower costs from strong operating performance improved profits. However, the PUI business delivered about $10 million less operating income than last year and, as Paul mentioned, in Q4 of last year, we had a net gain from contract modifications of about $15 million that did not repeat this year. Operating income was up 5% sequentially as the higher volumes more than offset lower PUI results. Operating margin of 16.7% declined 50 basis points versus prior year, as the lower PUI results and prior year contract modifications reduced operating income. Margin declined 80 basis points sequentially on lower PUI results and higher natural gas prices. We announced 2 more oxygen projects in China for coal gasification: a new 2,000-ton per day ASU in Hebei for Cangzhou Zhengyuan Fertilizer that will also produce liquid products for the merchant market and a 2,000-ton per day project in Guiyang with Guizhou Kaiyang, a subsidiary of Yankuang Group, with whom we are currently executing a 12,000-ton per day project in Shaanxi. The new project in Guiyang will also provide liquid products to the merchant market. Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics & Performance Materials. Segment sales of $617 million were up 5% versus last year. Underlying sales were up 3% on 4% higher volumes and 1% lower prices. Sequential sales were up 2% on higher volumes. Electronic sales were up 9% versus last year on strong tonnage and equipment results and the DA Nano acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, Electronic's material sales were down versus last year as we did not see the typical seasonal volume improvement. Sales were up 10% sequentially, again on strong tonnage and equipment results. Electronic materials pricing remained relatively stable, with the exception of xylene, as we mentioned last quarter. Performance Material sales were down 1% versus last year as volume growth was offset by lower prices and currency had a negative 3% impact. Volumes were positive in North America and strong in Asia, but weaker in Europe. Sequentially, sales were down 7% on lower volumes in all regions due to general economic weakness, a slower construction market and cautious customer supply chain management. We saw lower prices, both versus last year and sequentially, but are also seeing lower raw material costs. Operating income of $85 million was down 7% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 180 basis points to 13.8%. We had positive contributions from the higher volumes and good productivity performance, but this was more than offset by the impact of inventory revaluation. This was positive last year and negative this year, consistent with lower raw material prices this year. The segment effect is largely offset at the corporate level. Slide 21 in the appendix provides more detail. The net year-on-year impact of the inventory revaluation is 360 basis points. Sequentially, operating income was down 6%, and operating margin was down 120 basis points. The sequential impact of the inventory revaluation is 180 basis points. In Electronics, we announced a contract to supply 4 new phases of UMC's Fab 12A complex in the Tainan Science Industrial Park in Taiwan. We will build a new ASU, additional pipelines and a bulk supply system to complement our existing ASU and pipeline system in the Tainan Science Park, where we supply major semiconductor and TFT-LCD manufacturers. Now please turn to Slide 12, Equipment & Energy. Sales of $126 million were up 32% versus prior year, primarily on higher ASU project activity. Sequentially, sales were up 33%, primarily on higher ASU and LNG project activity. Operating income of $18 million was up 54% versus prior year on the higher activity and better cost performance. Sequentially, income was up 81% on higher LNG project activity. Backlog is up 35% over last year and up slightly over last quarter as LNG project development continues to be strong. In August, we announced an energy from waste project in Tees Valley, U.K. This innovative growth opportunity leverages our on-site business model and our experience with gasification, syngas cleanup and power generation. And just to clarify, this project is included in our capital spending backlog, not our Equipment and Energy sale of equipment backlog. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 13. Now let me give you a brief summary of our outlook. We saw the second half 2012 slower than the first half in most regions. Given this lack of momentum, we expect that economic growth will be modest at best in 2013. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we are forecasting manufacturing growth of 2% to 4%. While U.S. manufacturing has been a relative bright spot, we have seen growth slow as consumer confidence remains low, job creation disappoints and concern continues regarding the potential fiscal cliff at the end of the calendar year. European problems remain, and we do not expect meaningful growth anytime soon. In Asia, we have not seen the impact of Chinese stimulus actions, and the rest of developing Asia continues to experience below-trend growth as exports to Europe and the U.S. are slow. And we expect 2% to 4% growth in South America. We are hopeful that electronics growth will begin to rebound in 2013 from a weak 2012. Overall, for the year, we expect square inches of silicon processed to be up 4% to 6% next year. On the positive side, our project development and contract signings continue to be very strong. A number of these orders are in China for the gasification of coal. These projects are driven by the government's goal of developing domestic sources of energy and feedstocks, utilizing their vast coal reserves. We expect 2013 capital expenditures to be $2 billion to $2.2 billion. This is comparable to the $2.1 billion spent in 2012, excluding the $700 million for Indura. Our project backlog has increased again to about $3 billion, securing future profitable growth. We are beginning to see some slowing in a few of our customers' projects as they reflect the growing economic uncertainty. You can see an updated list of our major projects in appendix, Slide #17, and a geographic and business segment capital expenditures split in Slide #19. To help you with historical comparisons, Slide #20 in the appendix shows non-GAAP capital expenditures, which includes capital lease expenditures. This is on the same basis as our $2 billion to $2.2 billion guidance for 2013. Based on this, our initial earnings per share guidance range is $5.65 to $5.85 per share for 2013. While economic outcomes could vary, we are prepared to execute our business plans and adapt to whatever economic environment emerges. Walking from our 2012 earnings per share of $5.40, we have the following factors: New plant onstreams in 2012 and 2013 should add about $0.25 to $0.30. These are projects that are either onstream now or will be onstream soon and are backed by contractual commitments to buy. This number is slightly below our previous expectations as we have seen some customer-related delays in new project onstreams. Loading existing assets should add $0.10 to $0.20 to EPS. This is the factor most influenced by the economy. Indura, net of interest expense, should add about $0.10 versus last year, with the polyurethane intermediates business divestiture reducing earnings per share by about $0.05. In Equipment and Energy, we expect operating results will be higher due to more LNG activity. This is a $0.05 tailwind. Our cost reduction in Europe should add about $0.15 a share, somewhat offsetting the positives. Pension expense will be about a $0.20 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from September 2011 to September 2012. We expect currency and taxes to be a headwind. And given our continued strong capital spending, we would expect interest expense and shares outstanding to both increase modestly. Overall, about a $0.10 to $0.15 headwind. Now let's turn to our first quarter outlook on Slide 14. Our guidance for quarter 1 is for earnings per share of $1.26 to $1.31 based on the following factors: On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new plant onstreams. Further, progress on our cost initiatives will continue and the Indura acquisition transaction costs in quarter 4 won't repeat. Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect lower seasonal demand and lower equipment sales. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to seasonally higher maintenance spending and lower volumes as refineries begin taking their annual outages. We will see lower Equipment and Energy profits in the first quarter based on project timing, although we do expect a rebound through the rest of the year and higher pension expense, as previously mentioned. Now let me call -- now let me turn the call back over to John to wrap up.
John E. McGlade: Thanks, Paul. While we are pleased with the expected long-term positive impact of the portfolio actions we completed this year, we were disappointed with our overall performance during 2012. In June of 2011, we shared our 2015 goals of $15 billion in revenue, 20% operating margin and a 15% return on capital employed. Since then, the global economy has only delivered about half of the approximate 5% manufacturing growth that underpinned our expectations. This had a significant impact on our recent performance, particularly on merchant asset loading. Further, while we have improved productivity, it is not at the level we need it to be. We remain focused on attaining the operating margin goal of 20% and the return on capital employed goal of 15%. However, based on the continued slow economy, we don't expect to be able to reach our goals in 2015. Given the lack of economic clarity, we are not in a position to predict exactly when we will reach these goals at this time. Now let me talk about some of our near-term actions as we drive improvement towards these margin and return goals. We need to be more successful in driving volume growth in our merchant businesses, utilizing the investment in place to leverage margin improvement. Our focus in Europe remains on implementing our cost reduction plan as quickly as possible, ensuring we get to the $60 million per year of benefit, early in 2013. We've also recently brought onstream a new pricing analysis tool that should help us better target our pricing actions and improve both margins and returns in our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. In Tonnage, we have brought onstream and are executing a large number of new plants. We have to execute these projects on time and on budget and improve our plant efficiencies to drive further return improvement. The Electronics and Performance Materials businesses have seen significant improvement over the past few years. We need to continue to drive margin improvement and growth in these businesses through new products and focusing on our major customers. We have won a number of new LNG orders this year. We expect the global interest in LNG to lead to an expanded project list over the next few years so we are adding additional manufacturing capacity in Florida. Finally, 2012 margin and returns were helped by productivity and cost reductions. We must continue to lower our fixed costs, improve our operating efficiencies and leverage our fixed cost base as volumes expand. While our 2012 results are disappointing, and 2013 remains uncertain from an economic growth standpoint, we are focused on the key actions we can control to deliver our margin and return goals. As we end today's call, again, I would like to thank Paul for his 33 years of service to Air Products and especially these past 8 years as our Chief Financial Officer. I'd also like to extend my congratulations to Scott Crocco. Scott and Paul will both be on our next quarterly earnings call at the end of January. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Leah to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a quick question on Merchant Gases. It seems like Merchant business has been a work in progress for a couple of years. Now Indura seems to be margin dilutive. So when do you think you can get your margins back to sort of normalized range of 18%, keeping in mind that your long-term goal is 21% to 24%?
Paul E. Huck: So P.J., if we take a look at that, one of the key aspects here, which has been holding out on margins, has been our loading. And so as we've talked about that, we think that, that's an important aspect of bringing us back here. So the loading in the U.S., the loading in China, principally, given the load factors that we're at -- and that's going to be one of the things which boost it. In Europe, it is going to be the price reduction -- it is going to be the reduction in cost, which we need to put in. The bulk of that -- of this $60 million in savings will flow through Europe. And plus some pickup in the economy, eventually in Europe, will help loading, particularly in the packaged gas area where we have seen continued declines and things like the holdings of people holding the amount of cylinders, has declined in Europe steadily for the past 3 or 4 years. If we start the -- if that starts to pick up, people will start to hold more of those. The rental aspect, that flows directly back to our bottom line. So it's going to take some form of an economic pickup for us to see those things happen.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then secondly, you've been spending your CapEx at a rate of about more than 2x DNA. And now you mentioned today that some customers are delaying projects. I was just wondering if you can add some light on which area, which segments that customers are delaying these projects.
Paul E. Huck: And the places in which we've seen that, P.J., have principally been in hydrogen within the U.S. We've seen project delays in the Electronics business. We have not seen any significant delays in China on the gasification projects that are underway right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: On the CapEx. So we had a pretty aggressive CapEx build-out that was laid out at the Investor Day last year. Since then, the world's grown about half what you thought. You've talked about some people delaying some projects. Your stock is in a much -- more attractive level price-wise now. When you compare kind of doing stock buybacks to continuing aggressive build-out into what seems like scenarios that already have a little bit of oversupply, is there any thought of pulling back a little bit on CapEx and kind of readjusting that growth in a slower growth environment?
John E. McGlade: Yes. I think -- Duffy, this is John. I think what you got to look at is certainly, at a macro level, the economy is growing a lot slower than we anticipated. But more broadly, if you look at the on-site -- and most of our capital's going into our Tonnage business, which I really believe secures our long-term future growth and cash flows and, in turn, profitability, and most of that's going into either oxygen for gasification, largely in China and, up until very recently, hydrogen projects, again, largely in North America or the United States. And as we have for many, many years, we've been very clear about communicating sort of our priorities for the use of cash, which is really to reinvest in the businesses that fit and opportunities that fit our strategy. If you look at the total CapEx, something like 80%, 85% of the growth CapEx in these last couple of years has been in our Tonnage or on-site business model-type of investments.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just on photovoltaics in particular, could you size that business for us currently within your portfolio and then just kind of talk about what the volume growth in photovoltaics was for you last year and what you expect this next year?
Paul E. Huck: Sure. If you take a look at PV, PV between Electronics and the Merchant area is about 5% -- is about $50 million in each, or about $100 million in total. In the electronics area, that's where we sell the xylene, that's where we sell -- that's where we serve the bulk of the Gen2 customers, which this charge is more related to [indiscernible]. So it's about -- a little under 5% of our cyclical [ph] sales and electronic stuff we sell into their -- into that area. In Merchant, we principally serve the people who make the polycrystalline solar, and that's where we sell them LIN and argon for those things.
John E. McGlade: The only -- I'd just like to add the point, if I may, that we're not proud about this decision. It was a terrible decision and a terrible assessment of the market opportunity at a different point in time when the world looked a lot different, and we recognize the impact that this has to our shareholders. I do think, however, from the standpoint of the business, acknowledging this, putting this behind us, I think you'll begin to see the benefits that we've been able to put into the improvement of the overall Electronics business going forward. Certainly, we understand the severity of this, and there will be accountability associated with it.
Paul E. Huck: And Duffy, just to close, on the growth aspect of this, the growth has been very slow in this past year for that, because of the people backing off on the purchase of these things and the stimulus actions retreating.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was looking at your balance sheet. Your payable, sequentially, went up about $300 million to $1.9 billion, and your other long-term liabilities went up about $400 million. Can you talk about what those changes are about?
Paul E. Huck: Yes -- and those things are related to Indura first, as we've brought Indura on, Jeff, for things. There's a lot of changes in the balance sheet. Indura is a big -- was a big purchase. And remember, we bring on 100%. So even -- so I bring on $900 million -- we bring on, on the total balance sheet, probably about $1.3 billion or so when you look at that, from assets and liabilities associated with that.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And in terms of your minority interest line, because Indura made whatever it was, $9 million on an operating level, shouldn't the minority interest on a normal basis be much higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third if you exclude these various reversals?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so a thing which is getting -- which confuses this whole factor is that we had some tax adjustments, which also flow and went through that line there, which are -- there's things contained in the tax rate, and they offset in the minority interest line, which go around Indura for those things, too. But you're right, it will be larger in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I got a question on sort of the interim goals, 2015. By 2015, you said, is no longer valid. What can we expect in the interim? You're not even putting your 17% margin targets that you had achieved back in 2011. What interim goals should we expect? And is the issue here one of lack of focus? I mean, it seems the results have been somewhat inconsistent, and yet you're out making acquisitions in South America and joint ventures in the Middle East. Do you need to focus more on core operations?
John E. McGlade: Don, this is John. As I said earlier during my part of the call, we're not going to set out an interim set of goals until we have better economic clarity. Having said that, we are absolutely focused on driving improvement here. I think you have a fair question on are we not focusing on our existing business. And from my perspective, I think we are. Some of the operating issues that we had in the core businesses in Merchant and Tonnage, I believe we have our arms around. I believe we've put in the right management structures globally in these businesses. But as Paul correctly pointed out, particularly on the Merchant segment, we really need to have some economic tailwind to really be able to get the leverage out of the existing asset base that we have. If I just took, and Paul made these comments, if I just took a look at Europe in particular, in some cases, in the Packaged Gases businesses, we continue to go down after several years of slow or negative growth, or negative growth in southern Europe. And now we're seeing more of the core of Europe, if you will, also starting to slow.
Paul E. Huck: Yes, Don. And Don, think one thing here is we're going to have an Investor Day in November here in Houston. At that Investor Day, both John and I will address the path better here. It's kind of tight on the call today, and you asked a good question. It deserves a good answer from those things. But within the time constraints of today's call, it's hard for us to do. But at the Investor Day, we're going to talk some more about that and lay that out better as far as the path forward for us.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And one quick follow-up on the portfolio. You've gotten out of several non-core businesses. Does Performance Materials really fit? I mean, it's got attractive financial characteristics, but it's really a non-gases business. So is that the next leg in portfolio management?
John E. McGlade: Don, we've talked about certainly Performance Materials over the years. That business has been performing extremely well. We've restructured it. It gives us a really good insight to specific markets, and it really allows us to leverage some of their capabilities broadly across both their business and the Electronics Specialty Materials businesses. And quite frankly, their value-added approach to the market, in terms of extracting value based on the value that we bring to that customer base, is something I'd like to see more of more broadly across our portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: Was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the helium situation. It looks like you've pushed out the Wyoming facility startup date from the first half to the second half of last year. And just maybe an update on what's going on there and how confident you now are that it'll be up and running before the end of next fiscal year.
Paul E. Huck: Yes, Mike. And so as far as the plant in Wyoming, understand that our plant is -- and can come online at any time. It has been ready for almost a year now. We are waiting for our crude supplier to be -- to bring his plant online. We now expect that to happen late in our fiscal 2013. We do not control that aspect of things. However, there are other things which we are attempting to do, and we continue to explore them to get better supply of helium to us, and that's going out and exploring some other places in which we can -- and access some helium for us in the future. And so we -- it is our -- it is in our forecast that our crude supply will start to pick up around quarter 2 of this year and get some improvements in that. And then quarter 3, quarter 4, perhaps seeing the plant in Wyoming come onstream in quarter 4 for us. But obviously, very important, we are doing everything we can, and including taking some actions long term -- on the longer term, because we think the growth rate of helium is going to be -- continue to be very strong.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And then the other question I have is on Merchant in the U.S. and Canada. Just maybe talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics there. I think you mentioned you're losing some business to competitors. And I would just think that, given your position and given your kind of capacity utilization situation, that really, nobody should be pushing harder to get business or keep business. So why are we seeing business going to competitors?
John E. McGlade: Yes. I think, in fairness, in this business, you're constantly balancing volume with pricing and margin expansion. And so we do take a very, very customer-specific view, along with the assets that we have in a particular region and make those judgments real time each and every time. Yes, we're seeing more competitive activity there, but that isn't the lion's share of the lost business. We also are seeing some of our customers go out of business in general. Having said that, if I step up a level and talk more broadly, we have increased our new business signings significantly year-on-year, and we're getting that volume starting to come into the P&L. As we've told you over about the last year, there is typically a 3-, 4-quarter lag from when you sign business till it begins to show up in the P&L. And we've continued to redouble our efforts in terms of putting more feet on the ground and signing new businesses -- or signing on new business. And the point I was trying to make a moment ago is we have seen, year-on-year, substantial year-on-year increases in the amount of business that we've signed.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And is it fair to say we're at the 4 quarter end of the lag rather than 3 quarters in terms of those new contracts coming onstream?
John E. McGlade: Yes, I think that's a fair statement, and I think we've started to see that. I mean, it's masked, quite honestly, by some of these other issues that we've been talking about, including the argon and the helium shortfalls, and frankly, the contract modification that we addressed in the prior-year comparisons. But we are beginning to see that business come on. The other point I was making is the amount of new business we were able to sign throughout this entire fiscal year '12 was greater than our original budget and at a good trajectory from my perspective.
Paul E. Huck: Yes. Signings for '12 in the U.S. were up by double digits, so we should see this start to improve.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two related questions, one on productivity. I guess you've laid out -- you've done various initiatives already, you still have some ongoing. Is this it? Or do you feel that there's another tranche that can be done? Or is there like a certain percentage of the business that you could label, or a particular region that you could characterize as being subpar and in a fixed or exit kind of mode? And then the other question is as you think about longer-term growth opportunities in a slower growth environment, the natural gas -- the U.S. natural gas related to the projects like the fertilizer and chemical plants are going to be that much more attractive to your competitors. Are you worried that the pressure -- there's going to be downward pressure on returns on capital for people bidding for those very large projects in the U.S. going forward?
John E. McGlade: Okay, Laurence. Let me give a couple of thoughts, and then I'll turn it over to Paul to give you more specifics. My comments, Paul's comments are we're seeing progress in productivity. It's getting masked somewhat by the shortfalls in volume, but we also are very clear, both internally and I thought I was in my comments, that we need to do more there and that we are kicking up the resources broadly to continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma tools and really, really focus here more on the variable cost productivity that we can deliver from the P&L. On the sort of restructuring side of things, I think we've sized the organization globally for what we anticipate the growth of the economies that we're operating in to be. We've got to execute, as we've said, on the restructuring, for example, in Europe. And we're being very, very cautious in the addition of any additional growth-related investments and resources until we see much more visibility. Why don't I stop there? We could come to your second question, but Paul, you might want to add a few comments on productivity.
Paul E. Huck: Yes, just a couple of comments, Laurence, on the productivity end. On productivity, it is never it, so you constantly strive for that. That's what we do. So we drive for absolute cost reduction. Plus, the other aspect of this is by the things which we have put in place. We've talked about this, our SAP system, our shared services, our operating service centers. We are looking to leverage our fixed cost. And so we think that there is margin improvement, which comes as we grow this company, which you don't have to add the fixed cost, which you typically would have to add to service things. So we have capabilities in those centers which we have and in those systems, which can handle a lot more. And so we think that, that's a good margin improver for us as we talk about it. And so those are the things which we focus on. And also, finally, I think with -- regarding on the restructuring, we always look to size the business appropriately. So it's going to depend upon the economy going forward for us. John?
John E. McGlade: Yes, Laurence. If I understood your question on sort of the advent of lower natural gas, let's say for now in the United States or North America, certainly, I think net-net, that's an opportunity in terms of it ought to stimulate more manufacturing growth over the longer term. It's certainly already showing up, if you will, in the chemical industries in the Gulf Coast. And there, I believe, we're very well positioned to participate. Some of you will have the opportunity obviously to see the fruits of our labor and sort of the interconnecting of the world's largest hydrogen pipeline systems. That positions us very well in syngas supply to projects like this. But I think the other thing that we've talked about many times is tonnage projects, by their nature, are discrete investments that have to meet our return goals, both from a business level point of view and be accretive to the enterprise. And so we have control, I guess, for lack of a better set of words, on our destiny as to whether or not you take a project that is subpar from a return point of view. Now I think we have a lot of competitive advantage with what we've created in the Gulf Coast, which is where a lot of these projects are going to be. And we continue to stay very focused not only on our variable cost productivity but on driving the cost of our assets and our investments down by leveraging the base that we have and leveraging the experience that we have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: John, you guys, in the past, have talked about an industrial gas world -- industry that can grow at 9% a year. And I'm just wondering, do you think there's been a secular change? Is that a little bit too aggressive? Maybe the multiplier to GDP is not what it's used to be. Or do you think we're just in the cyclical air pocket here?
John E. McGlade: So I think it's more the latter than the former. And when we've talked about those types of numbers, we did talk about that in the context of a 5%, nominally 5% global manufacturing rate. And then we obviously dissected that a little bit further by the various regions in the globe and what their level of industrial gas intensity is. Right now, we're kind of sitting with a huge dichotomy where we're seeing pretty good -- over the last couple of years, good if not above trend line growth in the Tonnage side of the businesses. At the same time, we're seeing that eroded, if you will, by a significant slowdown on the Merchant side of the businesses.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And if I look at your global growth that you've put in the guidance range, 2% to 4% of global growth, I think, Paul, when you went through to work out the bridge to fiscal '13, you talked about maybe 3% or 4% earnings growth from end-market growth. I would have thought that it'd be a higher number. Is there something specific that's different this time around? Or why won't you have a little bit better base growth if you think the world might grow as much as 4%?
Paul E. Huck: If you look at this, on earnings growth, I think the other thing which goes in there is the projects which we're bringing onstream are also part of that end market, for things. And so if we look at where the bulk of the growth is in industrial gases as forecasted to happen, a lot of it does get around the on-site contracts. So our new projects are going to be a larger contributor to growth than a loading is going to be to them in the near term for us right now. The loading aspect of growth, I think, comes from people starting to expand their manufacturing capabilities in, still, in places like China, in places like the U.S., for us to get that load in there. And that's been very slow. Our indications in China from a manufacturing standpoint, if we look at rail freight, if we look at electricity demand, over the past few months, it has been close to 0, Bob.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: John, looking at your backlog, if you look at what you will bring onstream this year and what you're looking at from a bid standpoint, will the backlog by year end be higher or lower than the current $3 billion, do you think?
John E. McGlade: I think what we were trying to say is this, we expect it probably goes a bit lower here in the near term for the points we were making, where people are, frankly, slowing down some of their decisions, particularly outside of China. The China side of gasification seems to be pretty robust still. But I think, when you look more broadly, globally, whether it be hydrogen additions on a worldwide basis, U.S. Gulf Coast basis, or steel -- oxygen-related steel investments or electronics investments, people are taking a bit of a pause, if you will, or a slowdown in committing. Now I think these are valuable projects. And I think, when people have more clarity and insight to where this world's going, they're projects then, I think, could quickly be accelerated.
Paul E. Huck: Yes, Dave. I think another thing to point out is, and I've talked about this before, is I think capital expenditure is a much better way to look at this than -- and then to look at backlog. If you look at our underlying capital expenditures this year, take out the stuff with Indura, about $2.1 billion. For next year, we're seeing it's $2 billion to $2.2 billion, so that's about flat for us going forward here, which kind of reflects a little slowing of growth here.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And I guess, lastly on the photovoltaics, what did that business lose within Electronics in 2012 and what the restructured contracts should be nominal for next year?
Paul E. Huck: The business was about a breakeven in Electronics last year. On the Merchant side, we actually make money. We make money there.
Operator: Your next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A couple of quick questions. Could you walk us through the rationale behind the ACWA JV in Saudi Arabia and some of the key opportunities this presents?
John E. McGlade: Yes, sure. From my perspective, Saudi Arabia continues to represent, from the large tonnage side of the industrial gas business, a real opportunity. There's significant, obviously, hydrocarbon reserves there and investment, and we just felt that lining up with a partner like ACWA really gave us the right -- the ability to be effective in competing in that marketplace. And it really follows on from our strategy to be an investor in Abdullah Hashim Gases as well. Because as you well know, we really need and want to operate against an integrated gases model wherever we can. So the tonnage plant piggybacked, and then all aspects of the market. And the combination of those 2 relationships really allow us to look at that market in that context.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then another quick question just on new business trends, kind of put another way. Could you maybe touch on what sort of trends you're seeing with RFPs and how we should be thinking about any macro-related impact on those?
John E. McGlade: Yes, I think our request for quotations hasn't modified that much. What you're getting is more of a color commentary from Paul and I in projects that might have been, let's just say -- build into, and that's part of the reason we took down our '13 number for new projects, because projects that are in the capital stack are -- the onstream are slipping a quarter or 2 or 3 based on the customer's view of where the world is. I think there is a lot of uncertainty, and people will not necessarily act as quickly on their RFPs. But they're still trying to form projects, if you will, and understand their project economics. In China, the comment we were making, we hadn't seen much of a slowdown, if any, in the gasification side of things. I think we are seeing, if I contrast that to, say, hydrogen in North America, we are seeing people just delaying how and when they want to push the button to kick their project off.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, several years ago, when you addressed the chemicals portion of the portfolio strategically, I guess it was my impression that you had taken some steps to derisk and stabilize the polyurethane intermediates business, and that was part of the rationale for including it in the Tonnage segment for reporting purposes. Can you address what's changed in that business last couple of years and why you're now exiting if it's going to be $0.05 dilutive to earnings?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, Kevin. I don't think, really, our view of the business has changed at all with this. At that point in time, really a couple of years before that, we made the decision not to take the business overseas where a lot of this production is going. So we started playing an endgame strategy around it. We've put this into that segment because of the way the contracts are run in their long-term contracts. And so it fit the business model for us on those things. Now we are playing these contracts out, and so we had a chance to shut the plant down, which is trying to derisk the business further from them and make sure our customers still have their supply. And we will continue to have a profit contribution and a sales contribution from this business. But those contracts will eventually run out, and this business will go away for us.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then if I follow up, if I may, on Indura, just to your intention to acquire the remaining 35% you don't already own? And when would you expect to cross over to earnings accretion for that business?
Paul E. Huck: It's going to be accretive in quarter 1. So as we said, $0.10 a share. We're going to see accretion in quarter 1 from Indura for us. As far as our -- acquiring the other portion of this, it's held by an individual who we bought -- in the family who we bought the original, the portion which we own from. And they have a put option to us, which they can exercise anywhere from the end of the third year to the end of the fifth year.
Operator: Our final question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of silicon growth for 2013, can you give us a feel of how you expect that to sort of run out in the first half? Is it down considerable in the first half? And just trying to gauge what type of recovery we need to hit that outlook.
Paul E. Huck: Yes, I think -- Mike, I think you're right. I think quarter one and quarter 2 are going to be slower, and we're going to see upticks in quarter 3 and quarter 4. I know we said that in last year, also with those things, but we never saw the rebound in consumer electronics. We haven't seen a rebound in PCs for those things. And at some point in time, when I think the consumer starts to feel better and we get some more discretionary spending -- and in some time, on the PPC market, businesses are going to start pulling that forward also as they move -- as they see more reason to invest on things. So I do think it's a second half thing where we're going to see stronger growth in half 2 than in half 1.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in Merchant Gases for '13, underpinning your outlook, given the shortages and contract minification, what type of -- can you grow volumes next year?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. Yes, we can in Merchant Gases. Yes.
John E. McGlade: Thank you.
Paul E. Huck: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's presentation. We appreciate your attendance. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' third quarter earnings teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our Q3 results and outlook for the remainder of 2012. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3. Before we get into the quarter's operating results, I want to spend a few moments reviewing a few key items affecting this quarter's numbers. First, the sale of our Continental European Homecare business closed, and included in our quarter 3 discontinued operations results is an after-tax gain of $150 million, or $0.70 per share. Regarding the remaining European Homecare business located in the U.K. and Ireland, we have received bids from several interested parties, and we expect to close on the sale of the remaining business before the end of calendar 2012. Quarter 3 results include an after-tax charge of $30 million, or $0.14 per share, in discontinuing operations to adjust the book value of the remaining Homecare business to its estimated net realizable value. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 50% of our DA NanoMaterials joint venture at the beginning of April. Included in this quarter's results is a $55 million, or $0.25 per share, after-tax gain. This represents the gain on our previously held 50% ownership. This acquisition supports our strategy of delivering a portfolio of differentiated offerings to our semiconductor customers. Excluding these items, our adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations is $1.41 for the quarter, within our $1.40 to $1.45 guidance range. Good performance, given the weaker economy and unfavorable currency impacts, driven by a stronger dollar. To help you with the quarterly comparisons, Slide #14 in the appendix shows earnings per share from continuing operations x disclosed items for the past 2 years. We are on track with our cost reduction plans, and in fact, saw about $4 million of benefit in this past quarter. As we said last quarter, most of the actions should be completed by the end of our fiscal year. In quarter 4, the savings should more than offset the approximately $6 million of quarterly stranded costs generated by the Homecare divestiture. When fully implemented in 2013, we expect the cost-reduction plan to provide $60 million of annual savings. Now let's turn to our operating results. Please turn to Slide #4. Overall results were within our expectations. However, weaker economic growth prevented our volumes from growing as much as we had forecast, and we had headwinds from the stronger dollar. While our forecast for stronger demand in the second half of fiscal year 2012 did not come true, we are pleased that our strong operating and cost performance drove improved margins broadly. The European recession continues, and conditions worsened this quarter. Growth in China has slowed, and the seasonal rebound in electronics and other industries has been weaker than expected. For the quarter, sales of $2.3 billion were 5% lower versus prior year, primarily due to lower energy pass-through and a stronger dollar, particularly against the euro. Underlying sales increased 1% year-on-year, primarily due to higher pricing in Merchant Gases. Higher Tonnage Gases volumes and higher Equipment segment sales were offset by lower volumes in both Merchant Gases and Electronics. Sequentially, overall sales were unchanged. Underlying sales increased 1% on higher volumes in our Tonnage Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments, offset by lower equipment sales, and the DA NanoMaterials acquisition contributed 1%. Simon will provide segment and geographic details later. In spite of the weak volumes and unfavorable currency, operating income of $397 million increased 2% from the prior year due to excellent cost performance. This is the result of better planned operations and fewer turnarounds reducing maintenance spending and the positive impact of our cost-reduction plan in Europe. Sequentially, operating income was also up 6% on improved cost performance. Our operating margin improved to 17%, up 130 basis points versus prior year. Sequentially, our operating margin improved 100 basis points. Net income was up 2% versus last year and 8% sequentially. Diluted earnings per share increased by 3% versus last year and 8% sequentially. Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous or run-rate basis is 12.2%. On an annual basis, return on capital employed is 12.5%. Returning -- turning now to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share of $1.41 increased by $0.04 versus last year. Volumes decreased earnings per share by $0.04. Like last quarter, the mix impact of volumes was the principal factor. Unfavorable volumes in Merchant and Electronics were only partially offset by favorable volumes in Tonnage and Performance Materials. Also, lower-margin air separation unit sales replaced higher-margin LNG heat exchanger sales in our Equipment and Energy segment. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together increased earnings per share by $0.02. And as I mentioned, excellent cost performance was $0.10 favorable. Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together were $0.05 unfavorable. Equity affiliate income was $0.01 higher due to strong volumes from our Mexican affiliate. Our effective tax rate was about 1% higher, which reduced earnings per share by $0.02. And finally, fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.02. Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 6, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of $874 million were down 5% versus prior year, driven by the negative currency effect. Underlying sales were flat, with 2% positive pricing offsetting lower volumes. Sales were down 1% sequentially, again, driven by currency as volume gains of 1% were offset by lower pricing. Merchant Gases operating income of $165 million was up 4% versus prior year and up 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.8% was up 160 basis points compared to last year and up 150 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income was up on higher pricing across all the regions and better cost performance. Our distribution and production systems ran more efficiently, and we began to see the benefit of our restructuring program in Europe. Versus prior quarter, positive volume growth offset lower pricing, with better cost performance improving profits and margins. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In U.S./Canada, sales were up 1% on positive pricing. Overall, volumes were flat, with liquid oxygen/liquid nitrogen up slightly, liquid hydrogen up and argon and helium down as supply availability limited sales. As we mentioned last quarter, we report Mexico as an equity affiliate, so neither the volumes nor sales are included here. If we included Mexico with U.S./Canada, our overall North America LOX/LIN volumes would be up 3% on strong oil and gas injection volumes in Mexico. Unfortunately, we did not see any improvement in the helium situation this quarter. Supply challenges continue in both the U.S. and Algeria. We expect the situation to improve in FY '13, helped by the onstream of our new Riley Ridge facility and other new sources we are exploring. Argon supply was also limited this quarter as reduced oxygen demand for steel impacted argon co-production. We are working to expand argon production but expect supply limitations to extend into next year. Pricing was up 1%. LOX/LIN/LAR was flat, liquid hydrogen was down on lower natural gas costs, and helium was up. Contract signings were the strongest in 4 years and are well above target year-to-date, providing confidence for growth next year. LOX/LIN capacity utilization improved slightly but remains in the low 70s. In Europe, sales were down 12% versus last year, primarily due to currency, with underlying sales down 2%. Volumes were down 4% on weaker end-market demand for both liquid/bulk and packaged gases, particularly in Spain and Portugal. Helium volumes were down on supply availability. Pricing was 2% positive, with strength broadly across the businesses. LOX/LIN plant loadings remain in the low 80s, and new contract signings slowed but we are still ahead of our target year-to-date. In Asia, sales were up 6% versus last year on positive volume and price. Overall, volumes were up 4%. LOX/LIN volumes, excluding conversions, were up 7%, and packaged gas volumes continue to show strength across both our base business and the microbulk product line. Pricing was up 3% on strength in helium and packaged gases. Plant loadings remain in the high 70s as new capacity additions offset the volume growth. New contract signings remain strong, and we are above target year-to-date. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of a majority position in Indura, the largest independent industrial gas company in Latin America. Combined with our existing business in Brazil and our Mexico joint venture, Air Products will be the second-largest industrial gas producer in Latin America, a region second in growth only to Asia. We closed on the purchase of approximately 65% of Indura in early July, and we'll be including Indura in our results beginning in our fourth quarter. We are very excited about the great opportunities we see as we join the Indura team's local expertise with Air Products' global experience. Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $767 million were down 12% versus last year, driven by a negative 12% impact from lower energy pass-through. Volumes were up 2%, primarily on new projects, and currency negatively impacted sales by 2%. Sequentially, sales were down 2%, driven by a negative 3% impact from lower energy pass-through and a negative 1% impact from currency. Volumes were up 2%, again, primarily on new projects. Operating income of $134 million was up 17% versus prior year on the higher volumes and lower operating and maintenance costs. Operating income was up 7% sequentially as higher volumes and lower maintenance costs more than offset the anticipated impact of lower annual operating bonuses. Operating margin of 17.5% improved 430 basis points versus prior year and 150 basis points sequentially, primarily on the higher operating income. Lower energy pass-through contributed 80 of the 430-basis-point improvement versus prior year and 30 of the 150 basis points sequentially. The primary driver of improved margins was the lower costs. In terms of new business, we announced another contract to provide additional hydrogen to Motiva's Convent, Louisiana refinery from our industry-leading Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system. We have supplied Motiva for many years, and this is the second instance where our new Gulf Coast pipeline connection allows us to provide flexibility for Motiva to take product at multiple locations along the pipeline, certainly something Motiva values. Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $604 million were flat versus last year, with growth from our DA Nano joint venture acquisition offsetting 1% lower volumes, 1% lower pricing and a negative 2% impact from currency. Sequentially, sales were up 6% on higher volumes in the acquisition. Electronics sales were up 2% versus last year. Excluding the acquisition, electronic materials sales were down versus last year as expected with lower semiconductor production. On-site and equipment sales were slightly higher. Sales were up 10% sequentially, with the acquisition adding to higher base business. In general, electronics materials pricing was relatively stable, but we continue to see pricing pressure in xylene. The overall photovoltaic market and specifically thin-film PV have not developed as was expected a few years ago. Thin-film PV was expected to be a significant consumer of xylene and, as a result, market demand has not grown to match new industry xylene production capacity. Performance Materials sales were down 2% versus last year as volume growth was offset by lower prices, and currency had a negative 2% impact. Volumes were positive in North America and Asia but weaker in Europe. Sequentially, sales were up 2% on volume improvement across all the regions. Operating income of $91 million was down 17% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 310 basis points to 15%, primarily on lower volumes and pricing. Sequentially, operating income was up 6%, and operating margin was down 10 basis points as the sales growth was primarily driven by the acquisition. In Electronics, we just announced a major contract from Samsung to supply their new fabs in Xi'an, China. This is Samsung's largest-ever overseas investment, expected to be over $7 billion. Air Products will build plants to supply Samsung and provide liquid products to the merchant market in the region. This significant contract enhances Air Products' leading supply position with Samsung and the semiconductor industry. We also announced a new contract with Xiamen Tianma Microelectronics for the supply of bulk gases to their new TFT-LCD facility in Fujian Province. Now please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $95 million were up 19% versus prior year, primarily on higher ASU project activity. Sequentially, sales were down 14%, primarily on lower LNG project activity. Operating income of $10 million was up 14% versus prior year as better project cost performance overcame the mix effect. Sequentially, income was flat. Backlog is up 76% over last year and up 39% over last quarter, driven by our recent LNG awards to the highest level in more than 5 years. As we've been seeing, LNG bidding activity remains strong. We are pleased to have announced an agreement to supply equipment and technology to the PETRONAS Floating LNG project, 180 kilometers off the coast of Bintulu, Malaysia. This is our second floating LNG equipment order, and we are excited about the opportunities in this new area. We also shipped a 100th LNG heat exchanger from our Pennsylvania facility earlier this month. Our proprietary and industry-leading technology is helping meet the world's need for clean energy in 15 countries around the world. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 11. Now let me give you a brief summary of our outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we did not see the expected second half global economic recovery. We have also seen a stronger U.S. dollar than we forecast. Looking forward, we expect that economic growth will continue to be below our original expectations. While U.S. manufacturing has been an economic bright spot, recently, we have seen growth start to slow as consumer confidence remains low, job creation disappoints and concern grows regarding the potential fiscal cliff at the end of the calendar year. European problems continue, and we do not expect a return to growth any time soon. In Asia, we have not yet seen the impact of Chinese stimulus actions, and the rest of developing Asia continues to experience below-trend growth as exports to Europe and the U.S. are slow. Electronics growth should continue this quarter. Overall, for the year, we expect square inches of silicon processed to be down about 10%. On the positive side, our project development and contract signings continue to be very strong. A number of these orders are in China for gasification of coal. These projects are driven by the country's need for a cleaner domestic source of energy. We expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.9 billion, including about $700 million for the Indura equity. This will be up about 40% over last year, excluding Indura. Our project backlog has stayed consistent, at about $2.8 billion, which will deliver future profitable growth. You can see an updated list of our major projects in the appendix, Slide #13. To help you with historical comparisons, Slide #15 in the appendix shows non-GAAP capital expenditures, which includes capital lease expenditures. This is on the same basis as our $2.9 billion guidance for 2012. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter outlook. Our guidance for quarter 4 is for earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.47 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see Merchant Gases volume improvement, particularly in Asia. Electronics should see sequential volume growth. We will see further benefits from the implementation of our cost-restructuring program, and the improved LNG backlog should increase equipment results next quarter. Partially offsetting this sequential improvement, the Indura acquisition is expected to be about $0.02 dilutive in quarter 4 as we will recognize the transaction costs and asset write-up. We expect the U.S. dollar will remain strong. We also will see higher power prices and lower cryogenic plant efficiencies due to high summer temperatures. Therefore, we expect our earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.45 for the fiscal year, up 1% to 2% versus last year. Our guidance for the full year is lower by about $0.11 per share, on average, for the last half of the fiscal year. This decline is due to a stronger dollar, which has lowered our earnings by about $0.06 from our expectations last quarter. The Indura acquisition will reduce earnings by $0.02. Slower economic growth has reduced our forecast by approximately $0.08. And costs, as a partial offset, are favorable by about $0.05. Now let me wrap up. While economic growth continued to disappoint and currency headwinds were greater than expected, we are pleased with the strong cost performance delivered this quarter. We also have taken several portfolio actions to improve our business in the future, including selling our Continental European Homecare business and the Indura and DA Nano acquisitions. As we look beyond next quarter, we have a number of significant opportunities. Both our U.S. and Asia Merchant Gases business have installed capacity to sell. When manufacturing picks up, we will have the capacity to serve it. We are on track on our European cost reductions, and our productivity efforts worldwide are delivering results. Our capital expenditures continue to increase, and we expect to announce more projects before the end of the year. And LNG project interest is at an all-time high, and we expect the LNG project backlog to continue to grow. 2012 has certainly offered its challenges. Our focus is on meeting these challenges and achieving our 2015 goals. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Lea to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: What was your tonnage hydrogen growth in the quarter?
Paul E. Huck: The growth in volumes, Jeff, was a couple of percent. We didn't have anything new come on in this quarter.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: What's your outlook for volume growth in tonnage hydrogen for the fourth quarter and for next year?
Paul E. Huck: If we look at for the fourth quarter, we think the hydrogen growth should pick up in this quarter, principally because the refinery should run hard with the driving season in the summer, we think. So, that ought to be a favorable impact. As far as for next year, as we look at it, we'll have more to say to that. But it should be for gross, probably in the mid to high single digits, Jeff. We'll have more to say about that in the 4Q.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It's Jim Sheehan sitting in for David. And just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in Asia and specifically China on Merchant pricing. What is your outlook for trends in Merchant pricing going forward?
Paul E. Huck: Simon, you want to take that?
Simon R. Moore: Sure. So I think when we talk about pricing in Asia and China, it's actually a pretty good story. We saw good volume growth and we saw decent pricing in Asia. As we said, the volume growth perhaps not as great as we would've liked and would've expected. We've seen announced some of the China stimulus actions. We need those to translate into activity. And of course, in our Merchant segment, the volumes are affected by what's going on in electronics as well. So we continue to see some decent pricing in China and in Asia overall, and we'd expect that to continue.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And on Electronics, I guess the expected return -- rebound in year-over-year comparisons is taking a lot -- a little bit longer than expected, and you made some comments about what you thought about Q4. Is there any basis for additional optimism for 2013? Or are you expecting trends to remain pretty consistent over the next 6 months or so?
Paul E. Huck: I think a good portion of that, Jim, goes with how people feel from a consumer standpoint. And so we have consumers in the U.S. and Europe and in China who right now, as we track these consumer confidence indices, which don't feel great. And so if -- and once we remove some of the uncertainty, which exists around the world, I think we'll see better pickups on those things. But for right now I think everyone is being cautious. They're waiting for the outcomes of the U.S. elections and policy decisions on things and to see how Europe resolves itself with those things. There's a little too much uncertainty in the world right now. All that said, I would not paint the economic situation as horrible. It is just slow for us.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just in Europe, you mentioned volume growth slowing a little bit there, and then your outlook is basically for more of the same. Just wondering if you're seeing any signs of stabilization in Europe yet.
Paul E. Huck: As far as being stable, I mean, it is not diving -- things are not diving down. We are still seeing decreases from a volume standpoint overall in certain countries, especially places like Spain, of 3% to 4% with those things. So it has been tough from -- on a volume standpoint in Europe for us. But we haven't seen that start to level off from an economic standpoint, and we're going to need that to happen sometime soon before we can return to some growth there in Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unknown Analyst: Paul for Kevin. I just wanted to follow up on the new business signings in Merchant Gases in the U.S. When do you expect to see volume growth flow through from that momentum?
Paul E. Huck: We would expect to start to see the volumes pick up in -- probably from the signings in this quarter, probably sometime toward the end of the first quarter, the beginning of quarter 2 of next year. It normally takes 6 to 9 months to bring our customers onstream with those things. Now, we have had momentum for a few quarters now, so we would expect to see volumes improve in quarter 4 in the U.S. with things. And to be honest with you, our volumes were pretty good in the U.S. x the supply constraints, which we had, and Simon mentioned, we had supply constraints in helium and argon. If we look at that overall, we think our underlying growth in the U.S. probably would have been about 3% to 4%, if those supply constraints weren't there. So you can look at that as an upside for us. If we can get out of the -- out from under the supply constraints, which is going to take us a while, it's going to take us some quarters to get past there. But there's some growth there for us to harvest.
Unknown Analyst: All right. And as a follow-up, in the U.S. Gulf, when you flip that pipeline on or connect the 2, what impact do you expect to see right off the bat on the P&L?
Paul E. Huck: The impact on the P&L is not going to be great initially. We are going to have some more product which we can sell, and we have pretty much sold that. So we have people who are coming onstream as we look in our plannings for -- on signings on the pipeline. So that's going to happen over 2013. You're obviously going to see the depreciation of the pipeline coming in as a negative, but we'll also be able to run the pipeline better -- to run this, and not the pipeline, but to run the system better. That's going to take us some time to learn how to do that, but we think the efficiency gains on the system are going to be pretty good, because we'll be able to always run our most efficient plants and be able to cross volumes across the Louisiana system and the Gulf Coast system right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I've got 2 questions for you. First, could you go into a little bit more detail on the cost performance just in terms of the splitting it out between -- I guess what I'm thinking about is, how much of it is a function of restructuring? How much of it was a functioning of sort of your operating efficiency? And how much of it should we be carrying forward as we go into future quarters? And what other, if any, new opportunities do you see there?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. So if you take a look at the things that happened from a restructuring benefit, as Simon said, we had about $0.01 per share benefit from the restructuring. So it was overall $0.10, which we got from costs. If you then -- and if you look at that remaining $0.09 a share, about half of that came from variable cost efficiencies. And so that's us running our plants better, our power, our -- the natural gas for hydrogen using less for that to make hydrogen, saving on diesel fuel, et cetera, and about -- and the other half of that comes from lower spending, principally on maintenance in the operations area.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So when we think going forward, I assume the $0.01 should be getting larger as we move forward, right, as you move forward into the restructuring program? And then the question is, just how much of the balance of the $0.09 can you continue perpetually? Is that fair?
Paul E. Huck: We -- yes. And I don't think we saw anything unusual about the $0.09 going forward here. And so we think that, that's going to continue. And we think we can build upon that.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, terrific. And if I could just ask one other question. You've got 5 major projects that, on Slide 13, you have listed as the first half of fiscal '13. I'm just wondering if you can give us any sort of update on any of those projects leaning more towards the beginning of the first half or the end of the first half or anything we should be thinking about for that.
Paul E. Huck: Yes. Well, if you look at them -- if I look at them overall, I would say about those 5, about half and half roughly. Then when you look at these things, half come onstream in the first quarter, the other half come onstream in the second quarter for us right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of new projects this year, I think the expectation was supposed to add $0.30 to $0.35 in EPS. Is that roughly what it's going to contribute this year in '12? And would you see that number increasing, staying about the same, going down in 2013?
Paul E. Huck: It did, Mike, in 2012, so we did see that. And so the thing, which we haven't seen is -- we've actually seen areas, such as Europe, offload from us. But the new projects did contribute that. If we then take a look at 2013, we think we get a similar to maybe a slightly larger amount in 2013.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then, Paul, I think you or maybe Simon noted that packaged gases is still seeing some strength. Was that primarily in the U.S.? And could you sort of give us a reason why that market has held up?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. So Mike, good question. I think there, we were referring to Asia for packaged gases. Obviously, not having the U.S. business in Europe, packaged gases really being relatively weak. So that was primarily an Asia comment, and it's both on our, if you will, our base Packaged Gas business as well as strength in our marketable product line.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And last question, you also noted weaker demand in steel for oxygen. Was that on a sequential basis? And is that -- did that sort of get a little bit weaker as the quarter unfolded?
Paul E. Huck: It did, as the quarter came through. We think it's going to continue in the summer also, Mike. And it is weaker sequentially and weaker year-over-year.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
John Hirt: This is John Hirt on for P.J. this morning. In Merchant, it sounds like you'll be facing helium and argon supply challenges for another quarter or maybe even longer. Can you give us a sense of what the margin drag that is having currently and how much benefit you could get in FY '13 once those issues are resolved?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And John, I don't know if it's having as big a drag on margin as it's having on growth because the industry is tied in helium, the industry is tied in argon, in the U.S. particularly, is where we're talking about argon, and the discussion on helium go worldwide. But the prices of both have been up for us. So from a margin percent standpoint, there has been a drag. As I said, if you take a look at the U.S., we think that it probably cut back 3% to 4% on our growth within the U.S. in those 2 areas. And that's about a $1 billion-a-year business for us, so that's somewhere between $30 million and $40 million in sales. The contribution margins of those products are probably up in the 40% range for us, so you can see what the impact of that is for us.
John Hirt: Okay, that's helpful. And in Electronics, can you just talk about the trends that you're seeing across each of your end markets: semis, LCDs, PV, and kind of how do you see that playing out for the rest of the year?
Paul E. Huck: Simon, do you want...
Simon R. Moore: Sure. And I think, as always, we talk mostly about the semiconductor market because as you remember, that's about 80% of our business. So we made a reference to PV, which is really quite weak right now. That's only about 5% of our business. TFT-LCD is fairly flat, not showing a lot of growth. That's only about 10% of our business. In the semiconductor, the external forecast that we see are forecasting a drop for our FY '12 of about 10% to 11%. So Q3 was better than Q2. It was worse than Q3 last year. We expect kind of the same story for Q4 that things will be better than they were in Q3 but worse than they were in Q4 last year. I think one of the key points though is, again, as we talked many times, is our strength. We're the industry leaders. Our electronics sales were up 1% through 3 quarters, while the industry was down, and as I've said, in the low double digits. Intel's CapEx continues to be up significantly over last year. TSMC's Q2 sales were up about 20%, stronger than the industry. Certainly, both those folks are commenting about maybe there's a little bit of weakness in Q4 and Q1. But, again, Intel, Samsung and TSMC, where we're the leading supplier, are going to spend the majority of the industry's CapEx in this year. So that helps us grow going forward.
John Hirt: Okay. And where are your NF3 operating rates currently?
Simon R. Moore: So NF3 operating rates are probably in about the 80% range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob this morning. With some of the slowing macro numbers coming out of China, I was wondering if you've seen any kind of deferral or a little bit lengthening in the pipeline for new contract signings there or any signs of customers wanting to defer the timing of new projects coming online over there.
Paul E. Huck: We have not seen that occur. And on the -- in the speech portion of this teleconference, one of the things that I talked about was that really the drive for gasification projects is to give them a clean source of energy in China, so it's really an infrastructure project and less tied to the economic growth of the country there.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And on the Tonnage volume, I think you mentioned there was maybe a negative currency impact to the volumes in some regions. Which regions and maybe end markets were you talking about specifically there?
Paul E. Huck: Europe.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: It's in Europe.
Paul E. Huck: Europe, yes, on Tonnage. It wasn't on volume. It was on sales activity. It was on sales that Simon talked about.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And are you seeing any of your customers in Europe on the Tonnage side start to come close their minimum take on their take-or-pay contracts?
Paul E. Huck: We have not seen that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Gulley with Gulley & Associates.
Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC: Yes. Now that you've closed the Indura acquisition, can you comment a little bit about the earnings accretion you might enjoy for fiscal '13?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so I can't give you some more -- the comments on that, Mark. And the comments will get better as we get the -- a good look at the write-up, which is going to happen. As you know, we have to have a third party take a look at our -- at the company and do the write-up. But as we look at the accretion dilution impacts for 2013 for Indura, we would expect that to be somewhere around $0.05 to $0.10 right now, depending upon what happens with the asset write-up for us.
Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC: Okay, turning to Tonnage, if I can. You reported a 2% volume gain in the quarter. Can you break that down, as you often do, between base tonnage volumes and how much you enjoyed from new plant startups?
Simon R. Moore: Mark, really, that was almost all from new plant startups. The base volumes were fairly consistent.
Paul E. Huck: Overall, yes, overall.
Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC: Okay. And then finally on Tonnage, the maintenance expenses kind of jump up and down a little bit, and so the margin or the operating income gain we saw in the quarter, how much of that was due to a lower than, let's say, normal maintenance expenses? And -- or how much is really true underlying operating income growth that you might see into fiscal '13?
Paul E. Huck: I think, as far as the maintenance expenses for this quarter, they were low. It's always hard to put a number around whether that was the right number or not. We had good performance. We expect good performance in quarter 4. We would expect the spending to kick up in quarters 1 and quarters 2, because they're normally higher as far as the expenditures are concerned on turnarounds. But the performance in that area was good, Mark. So I think, overall, we have had a good couple of quarters in a row now on the spending in that area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: You had mentioned that you weren't seeing any slowing in China tonnage projects, primarily because you're still seeing gasification being a new driver. I was just wondering, given the discussion about the potential of shale gas in China, how might that impact the gasification opportunity over time? And are you expecting that as we get into the later part of this decade, that maybe the coal gasification opportunity isn't as big as you might have expected a couple of years ago?
Paul E. Huck: We have taken a look at that, Mike, and we think that shale gas -- actually, if the findings are large, which is still a question mark, and it's going to take a while to get there for China, but that it would first eat into the LNG sales into China. And that the gasification projects are really intended to get at the energy independence aspect of things, and that shale gas would replace LNG right now. That would be our view. So we don't see a lot of that curling back, trying to cut back on that. Now the gasification opportunity, we also think, is not going to always be there. We think there's a lot of development around that, because China has the coal. They want to use the coal. Gasification is a good way to use that coal. It makes it easier to transport the coal. It also makes it more environmentally sound. But we think that those gasification opportunities occur basically between now and 2020, and I don't know what happens after that. We'll see what -- and we'll see what things happen. But there's still a lot of those opportunities there going forward. They're putting in place the infrastructure to do that, so we feel sound that those projects are going to continue regardless of what happens to shale gas. Because shale gas actually is a play probably out in the late portion of the decade, which we're now in.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: Got it, got it. And then in terms of the Merchant volume trends, particularly on the liquid side of Merchant, just wondering if you can comment on what you saw across the 3 geographies in kind of June versus May and thus far in July versus June. Are you seeing any deceleration as you look across those geographies?
Paul E. Huck: We are not seeing a deceleration across the geographies of the trends right now. So Europe is -- has continued to move down, and we would expect that happening. Asia has started to move up, particularly in China. It's early to call that. We hope that, that continues. But we are optimistic about that, and that's a factor which I've called out in the guidance. The U.S. still is -- the forecast we have is for growth to be slow for us, but we do expect to see growth in the U.S. sequentially.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And then last question, Paul, is just on the share repurchase activity during Q3. How much did you repurchase? What was the share count at the end of the quarter? And can you remind me what your -- what's remaining on the authorization and how you might expect to deploy that, given the Indura acquisition?
Paul E. Huck: So we did not repurchase any shares in this past quarter -- in quarter 3. We did, in quarter 2, repurchase $53 million as far as those -- as far as shares are concerned. Our diluted share count is like 214.7 million or so, I think, for us. And if we look at going forward, given Indura as we said last quarter, we would not expect to be in market and buying back shares.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: So the quarter-on-quarter decline in share count was purely the impact of activity during Q2?
Paul E. Huck: Well, yes, yes. It was the impact of quarter 2.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
Alina Khaykin : Yes. This is actually Alina on for John. Quick question on the Merchant business. It seems like you guys have been a lot in terms of operating efficiency and cost cutting. So 2 things. One, how much more kind of low-hanging fruit do you have left there? And it also seems like, how much of the cultural change is internally, how much more do you have to go in that area?
Paul E. Huck: Alina, as far as we are concerned, there's probably not a lot of things, which I would call low-hanging fruit. I think we got them more back in the '90s to a great extent. But as far as changes are concerned, and we still see a lot of it, I believe, to make changes and to use and to run the system and gain efficiencies. And so a lot of that gets around trying to use the data we have in SAP and continuing to improve the tools we have to make our deliveries more efficient, to open up windows and things like that and operate better, both our plants and the distribution system itself, and also for better ways to serve and interact with our customers electronically. So we continue on this journey every day.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes. Paul, a question on going back to U.S. Merchant. I mean, you've talked about some time now about additional signings, building up your mini-bulk sales force. And I'm just wondering why we're not seeing more and more volume from this activity. Can you kind of tell us when you really expect volumes to pick up, how those signings are going? And speaking of Merchant overall, if you do get some of this volume growth next year, would you -- and the cost cuts that you're taking in Europe, would you expect to get back to and beyond your old 20% operating margin target in the Merchant business?
Paul E. Huck: The answer on that -- on the last question is yes, Don. And we do expect to get above that 20% target in this business here. With regard to the volumes, as I said before, I think we -- our growth would've been about 3% to 4% in this past quarter if we didn't have the supply constraints. So that's one of the things which we have to fix, that we have to get more access to more argon. We're taking steps to do that. We have to get access to more helium. We're taking steps to do that. It's not going to all happen in one quarter. It's going to something which is going to unfold over 2013 for us as we work those -- as we work our options there for us. With regard to the signings which we're seeing, we are also seeing a number of customers go away. And that's occurring for a couple of reasons: number one, lower power prices have moved some of our food business out, as people have chosen to go to mechanical freezing; number two, oilfield services has been slow in the Appalachia area. And principally there because of -- it's mainly dry gas, and the rigs have moved out of there and moved to the Bakken. We have seen a pickup in that area for those things, but they're still drilling and so they've got -- it's a while before some of the frac-ing will -- and will pick up out there. But we do have a new plant going on -- going out to serve the mid-Continent area, so we feel good that we're going to have some growth from that in the future. With regard to the other aspect of signings, growth overall within the U.S. has been slow from a process manufacturer's standpoint. Steel growth has been tempered. Petrochemical growth has been tempered and mainly because the new plants aren't onstream yet in those areas. And so as we look to the future, we think there's lots of opportunities for us. But we got to get the economy moving a little bit stronger.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Well, I guess I'm a little confused because your rates have languished in the low 70s since the beginning of the upturn in mid-'09, your competitors in the low 80s now. So I would have thought that -- I mean, they've seen many of these same problems. I would have thought your signings would've closed some of that gap by now.
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And they should have, Don. But as I've said, we have also seen business move away from that, and that's been the issue. There have been a number of people who have stopped using products or who have gone out of business for us and shut down.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then one follow-up. Speaking of gaps with your competitors, your stock continues to be at quite a high historical gap with Praxair. I know you've bought Indura. You've got additional CapEx requirements, but you still got room in your balance sheet, it would seem, to lever up and buy back stock here, what would seem to be an attractive price if all your growth plans do come to fruition. So just if you can comment on why you're not buying back stock anymore.
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And the reason why is because of the way in which we're going to run the company. We're going to maintain an A bond rating. As we look at this, we don't have room to buy back stock and maintain the A bond rating for us. If we did, I would be in the market to do that. But we want to maintain the flexibility to operate. And we think that is best when -- at an A bond rating for ourselves.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two quick questions. One, on -- often, when you discuss pricing in -- for on-site projects, you talk about sort of the substitution costs that the customers face. As the customers see their -- as the large customers see their cost of capital coming down, are you seeing more pushback on pricing for projects?
Paul E. Huck: No. We are not seeing them favor the main case anymore than that, typically.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And as you look at the U.S. economy, how would you gauge the sort of -- your sensitivity to possibly triggering a round of productivity in the U.S.? I mean, is that -- you've taken down your outlooks a couple of times. Can you speak just a little bit about -- are you fairly comfortable with the U.S.? Do you feel that maybe there might be another round that's needed, given the environment or how you're thinking about the risks as we look toward 2013?
Paul E. Huck: Our business within the U.S. is solid. Our margins are good. Our -- and as we look at the growth prospects, we're there and we feel good about that. So I would not see us trying to take any action within the U.S.
Operator: Our last question comes from John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: I think you said that adding in Mexico alone would have increased your North American volumes by 3%. Was that with 100% of Mexico or just your proportional share? And could you tell us what Mexico is up year-over-year and what the oil and gas component of that was, because that seemed like that drove it?
Simon R. Moore: Yes, John. So just to be clear, what we said, our LOX/LIN volumes would've been up 3%, and that assumes 100% of Mexico. The oilfield services on a year-on-year basis were up pretty significantly. I think it was in the range of 20% to 30%. And, again, most of that was driven by the liquid nitrogen for oilfield services.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Simon R. Moore: Okay. Thanks, Lea. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's presentation. We appreciate your attendance. You may now disconnect.

Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products second quarter earnings teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our Q2 results and outlook for the remainder of 2012.  We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website.  Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.  Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3. Before we get into this quarter's operating results, I want to spend a few moments reviewing a few items impacting this quarter's numbers.  First, as we announced last quarter, we are in the process of divesting our European Homecare business, and as a result, we are now reporting this business in discontinued operations. As a reminder, European Homecare contributed $0.10 to our fiscal quarter 1. If we adjust our previously provided guidance for moving Homecare to discontinued operations, it would reduce quarter 2 by $0.09 and the full year by $0.30. Specifically, quarter 2 guidance adjusts to $1.28 to $1.34, and full year guidance adjust to $5.60 to $6.  The sale of our Continental European Homecare business has been approved by the European Commission, and we expect to close next week. Our quarter 3 results will reflect an after-tax gain in the range of EUR 105 million to EUR 130 million or approximately $140 million to $170 million from this transaction. We continue to work towards completing the divestiture of the remaining European Homecare business located primarily in the U.K.  We also recorded a cost reduction charge of approximately $60 million after tax or $0.28 per share. This charge represents the ongoing actions we are taking to improve our cost structure, particularly in Europe. It includes removing the stranded costs resulting from our decision to exit the Homecare business and the actions we are taking to rightsize our European cost structure in light of the challenging economic outlook.  This charge includes a severance cost for the elimination of about 600 positions, primarily in Europe, and the write-down of 2 small plants. Most of the position elimination should be completed by the end of the fiscal year. In quarter 4, the savings should offset the approximately $6 million of quarterly stranded costs generated by the Homecare divestiture. When fully implemented, we expect the cost reduction plan to provide $60 million of annual savings.  Third, we recorded a tax gain of $58 million or $0.27 per share for a disputed tax item which was finally resolved. This item dates back almost 20 years in Spain. There is no cash impact. And as you can see from a book basis, this essentially offsets the impact of our cost reduction charge this quarter.  Excluding these items, our adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations is $1.31 for the quarter. As I mentioned, the comparable range for our previous quarter 2 guidance is $1.28 to $1.34. The comparable results for quarter 2 fiscal '11 were $1.33, and for quarter 1 fiscal '12 was $1.26.  Now let's turn to our operating results. Please turn to Slide #4. Overall, the quarter was within our expectations. However, our volumes did not grow through the quarter as we had expected. For the quarter, sales of $2.3 billion were 2% lower versus prior year, primarily due to lower energy pass-through and a stronger dollar.  Underlying sales increased 2% year-on-year, with both volume and price contributing 1% each. Higher tonnage volumes in both the refining and steel markets were partially offset by lower volumes in Merchant Gases and electronics. Pricing gains were recorded broadly across our merchant segment.  Sequentially, sales increased 1%, with volumes up 2% and pricing contributing 1%, partially offset by lower energy pass-through. Simon will provide segment and geographic details later.  Operating income of $375 million decreased 6% from prior year. The mix impact of volumes was the principal factor. Unfavorable volumes in merchant and electronics were only partially offset by favorable volumes in tonnage and performance materials. Also, lower-margin air separation unit sales replaced higher-margin LNG heat exchanger sales in our Equipment and Energy segment.  Sequentially, operating income was up 6% on higher performance materials and Tonnage Gases volumes. Our operating margin declined to 16%, down 60 basis points versus prior year. Sequentially, our margin improved 80 basis points. For the quarter, net income decreased 3%, while diluted earnings per share decreased by 2%.  Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous or run rate basis is 12%. On an annual basis, return on capital employed is 12.6%.  Turning to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share of $1.31 decreased by $0.02 versus last year. Lower volumes increased earnings per share by $0.09 year-on-year. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together increased earnings per share by $0.02, and costs were $0.01 unfavorable.  Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together were neutral. Equity affiliate income was $0.01 higher, primarily due to strong volumes from our Mexican affiliate. Fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.02. And finally, excluding the Spanish tax gain, our effective tax rate of 24.5% contributed $0.02. All other factors added $0.01.  For fiscal '12, we expect the tax rate to be between 24% and 25%, a percentage point lower than our previous guidance.  Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 6, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of $884 million were down 3% versus prior year. Underlying sales were down 1% with positive pricing offsetting most of the impact of lower volumes. Currency was 2% unfavorable. Sales were flat sequentially with positive pricing offsetting lower volumes.  Merchant Gases operating income of $153 million was down 8% versus prior year and also down 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 17.3% was down 80 basis points compared to last year and down 140 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income declined on lower volumes across most of the businesses. Pricing and our operating cost performance were both positive, but did not overcome the volume decline. The full quarter effect of our new LaPorte ASU improved argon production and distribution costs. Versus prior quarter, pricing was also positive, but higher costs and the impact of lower volumes reduced operating income.  Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In U.S./Canada, sales were flat, with higher pricing offsetting reduced volumes. Volumes were down 2% on weakness in hospitals, electronics and liquid hydrogen. U.S./Canada LOX/LIN volumes were flat. We report Mexico as an equity affiliate, so neither the volumes nor sales are included here. If we included Mexico with U.S./Canada, our overall North America LOX/LIN volumes would be up 6% on very strong oil and gas injection volumes in Mexico.  Helium sourcing challenges continue. We now don't expect our new U.S. helium facility to be onstream this fiscal year as our feedstock supplier continues to have challenges with their facility. Pricing was 2% positive with improvement across the product lines as we took actions to recover higher costs. Contract signings rebounded to the strong levels we saw in the second half of 2011, and we expect to begin to see the positive volume impact of these 2011 signings next quarter. LOX/LIN capacity utilization remains in the low 70s.  In Europe, sales were down 5% versus last year, primarily due to currency with underlying sales down 1%. Volumes were down 2% on weak end market demand in both liquid/bulk and packaged gases. In addition, helium volumes were down on supply availability. Pricing was positive in both liquid/bulk and packaged gases. LOX/LIN plant loadings remain in the low 80s, and new contract signings continue ahead of target.  In Asia, sales were up 1% versus last year with underlying sales flat. Overall, volumes were down 1%. LOX/LIN volumes, excluding conversions, were flat, with slower overall demand and a more modest than typical manufacturing rebound post-Lunar New Year. Packaged gas volumes increased on the continued success of our microbulk product line. Helium volumes were lower as product availability limited sales. Pricing was up 1%.  Helium pricing was positive, but we saw lower liquid argon pricing due to the prior year price premiums in the China spot market. Plant loadings were in the high 70s. New contract signings were the strongest ever and align well with the new capacity that will come onstream for the rest of the year.  We announced an exciting win in China this quarter. We will supply our integrated oxy-fuel solution to Yongxin Glassware in China. We will install a VSA non-cryogenic oxygen production unit, an automatic flow control skid and our Cleanfire burners to improve productivity and reduce emissions from their glass production. We've installed over 1,500 Cleanfire burners around the world.  Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $784 million were down 2% versus last year, driven primarily by an 8% impact from lower energy pass-through. Volumes were up 7% on existing asset loading and new projects. Sequentially, sales were down 3%, also primarily driven by a 6% impact from lower energy pass-through. Volumes were up 3%.  Operating income of $125 million was up 4% versus prior year on the higher volumes, was up 13% sequentially on higher volumes, bonus timing and less impact from the polyurethane intermediates contract modification discussed previously.  Operating margin of 16% improved 90 basis points versus prior year and 220 basis points sequentially on the higher operating income and lower energy pass-through.  We continue to win important deals in key growth markets, including large on-site oxygen projects for coal gasification in China. Last month, we announced a contract to supply oxygen to Xinlianxin's coal gasification unit in Henan, China. We will build an ASU to supply 2,000 tons per day of oxygen to Xinlianxin and over 250 tons a day of liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon for the region's growing Merchant Gases market.  With this award, we are currently executing 4 different projects to supply oxygen for coal gasification in China. In total, this represents almost 25,000 tons per day of oxygen capacity. And we expect to announce additional oxygen and hydrogen deals through the rest of 2012.  Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $567 million were down 2% compared to last year on 2% lower volumes, primarily driven by softer electronics demand. Sequentially, sales were up 6%, primarily driven by stronger performance materials demand. Electronics sales were down 4% compared to last year on slower end market demand and down 2% sequentially on the expected seasonality.  Electronic materials sales were down versus last year as would be expected of a lower semiconductor production, while tonnage and equipment were higher as we see the industry leaders continuing to invest in new capacity. The semiconductor industry was down versus prior year in the first half, but as we said last quarter, we expect a stronger second half of 2012.  Electronics materials pricing was stable. Performance materials sales increased 2% versus last year on stronger volumes and price. Sequentially, sales were up 17% on volume improvement as we saw the typical seasonal recovery plus improvement in key end markets across the regions.  Operating income of $86 million was down 7% versus prior year, and operating margin was down 80 basis points, primarily on lower volumes and higher raw material costs in electronics. Sequentially, operating income was up 9%, and operating margin was up 50 basis points to 15.1%, primarily due to higher volumes.  In electronics, we announced the acquisition of all of DuPont's interest in our DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials 50-50 joint venture. DA Nano manufactures chemical mechanical planarization slurries used in the semiconductor industry. This acquisition helps broaden our strategy of delivering a portfolio of differentiated offerings to our customers. The deal closed on April 2, and we expect to book an after-tax gain of approximately $45 million to $55 million in Q3.  Now please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $110 million were down 3% versus prior year on lower project activity. Sequentially, sales were up 24% on higher project activity. Operating income of $10 million was down 56% versus prior year, primarily due to lower LNG activity, but up 34% sequentially, primarily due to higher LNG activity.  Backlog is up 69% over last year, and we believe we will announce more orders in 2012. As we said last quarter, LNG bidding activity remains strong, and we were pleased to announce an agreement to provide technology and 2 LNG heat exchangers to JKC joint venture for their Ichthys project in Darwin, Australia. These exchanges will produce 8.4 million tons per year of LNG from the Browse Basin offshore Western Australia.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 11. Now let me give you a brief summary of our outlook. As we said earlier in the year, we expected that the first half of our fiscal year would be slower in the U.S. and Asia, and that Europe would be in a recession. We also expected that the second half of our fiscal year will be much stronger as economic activity picked up in both the U.S. and Asia.  While we still expect improvement in the second half, our volume growth in the first half has been slower than we anticipated. In the U.S., volumes have been lower than expected as new customers have been slow to ramp up. Europe volumes have been close to expectations. Asia volumes have lagged the most, with declines year-on-year in both China and electronics.  Looking forward, we expect our U.S. volumes to grow faster in the second half of our fiscal year. For Europe, our emphasis is on cost reduction and price improvement because we do not foresee much volume growth.  Finally, we expect Asia volumes to improve in our second half, although at a slower rate and from a lower base than originally anticipated.  On the positive side, our project development and contract signings continue to be very strong. We expect our capital expenditures to be at the high end of our previously stated $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range. We continue to win large oxygen projects for coal gasification in China. Our new project wins have increased our project backlog to $2.8 billion, securing future profitable growth.  However, given our lower volume starting point coming out of quarter 2 and a lack of strong momentum in March, we are lowering our guidance. We expect our earnings per share to be between $5.47 and $5.60 for the fiscal year, up 2% to 4% versus last year. As a reminder, our previously communicated guidance included $0.30 for Homecare. The principal reason for the decline in guidance is due to weaker demand in Merchant Gases and electronics.  Both our range for the next quarter and the full year guidance exclude the gains we expect to book on the closing of the Linde Homecare transaction and our portion of the DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials venture referred to earlier.  As we previously told you, we would be repurchasing about $300 million of shares this year. As you can see on our cash flow statement, we did repurchase $53 million in quarter 2. Given our success in winning new business which will drive our capital spending to the high end of our range, we will likely not be repurchasing more shares this year.  Now let's turn to our third quarter outlook. Our guidance for quarter 3 is for earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.45 based on the following factors: On the positive side, we expect to see Asia Merchant Gases post strong gains this quarter as volumes start to rebound from the lower-than-anticipated level in the first half of the year. Electronics should start to see, and Performance Materials should continue to see, normal seasonal volume improvements in their markets. We should begin to see the early positive impact of the restructuring program focused on removing the stranded costs from the Homecare divestiture and in appropriately sizing our Europe business for the economic environment.  Partially offsetting this sequential improvement, we expect that lower bonuses in our tonnage business as many of our annual operating bonuses occur in the second quarter. Although our Equipment and Energy bidding activity remains strong, our results will be lower in quarter 3 due to project timing.  Now let me wrap up. We have taken a number of significant actions in 2012 that we are confident will deliver better performance in 2013 and beyond. We took actions to improve our portfolio and business mix by exiting our Homecare business. We are implementing cost reductions across Europe to remove the stranded costs of our Homecare operation and also reduce the cost of conducting our merchant European operations. We won a number of new orders under long-term take-or-pay agreements that expands our tonnage presence in China and add to our leading global hydrogen position.  We continue to improve our electronics business even as industry millions of square inches processed was down significantly in this quarter and year. We have improved margins, one new tonnage business and taken full control of the DA Nano joint venture we had with DuPont. We are winning LNG orders, which will expand equipment profits in 2013. 2012 has certainly offered its challenges. And while not seen in our current results, we are confident the actions we are taking continue to position us to meet our 2015 goals.  Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Deanna to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
John Hirt: This is John Hirt standing in for P.J. today. In electronics, overall sales and volumes were up about 6% sequentially, but core electronic sales were down about 2% and, I guess, about 4% year-over-year. Can you talk about why that was weak and maybe give some color on how you see that playing out for the rest of the year?
Paul E. Huck: Sure, we can. If we just take a look at our electronics business, we have -- what we have seen is we have seen a pretty sharp decrease in the first half of this year in millions of square inches processed, one of the things which I talked to. We think that the current stats which the industry published has that measured down 13% year-over-year. If we just look at our base electronic sales for the whole -- for that whole time period in that first half, we're about flat. So we have -- and weathered this storm in the industry well. We still think that the industry for the full year is going to be down year-over-year. But sequentially, we are going to start to see improvements in their production statistics. So we would expect to start to see our electronics business turn positive year-over-year in sales such that for the rest of the year, we -- that we would have a mid-single-digit increase in sales, probably in just the electronics portion of Electronics and Performance Materials.
Simon R. Moore: And John, maybe just to add as Paul mentioned, we were flat with the industry reports being down. And again, this goes to what we've talked about, our strength with the industry leaders. If you look at what Intel talked about, they were a little bit better than they expected to be, saw a better improvement next quarter. TSMC sales were up, and Samsung continues to do well and look to invest. In fact, they're working on their major fab investment in China. So as we've talked about, we're the leading supplier to the leaders in the industry. They continue to do better than the industry, which help support our sales and makes us less cyclical.
John Hirt: Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. If you had to put, I guess, the sources of your revised full year EPS guidance into regional buckets, how much of that guidance reduction would you attribute to Europe and maybe how much would you contribute to other regions?
Paul E. Huck: I -- so if I was putting it in region, realize that I don't do regional profitability. And so if I was looking at the impact, it would be some in Europe in our Merchant Gas area. And if you look at the guidance roughly -- and so if we went to the midpoint -- so let's just do some math for you. If you went to the midpoint, to the $5.60 to the $6, that will be $5.80. If you go to the midpoint, to the $5.47 to $5.60, that's roughly $5.55, so it's down $0.25. If I look at that, the largest area in which we have seen an impact has been electronics for us. And though -- even though, as I've said, we're going to have a gain in profits in this year in electronics, we were actually expecting more because we thought that the industry production would be higher. The MSI index, which we talked about, was going to be up some -- about 5% or so was our original prediction. We actually think it's probably going to be down about 10%. But we're going to increase our profits there, but not as much. So a large portion of that decrease really has to do with electronics. The next large area is the merchant area, which has some in -- and some decline in the U.S., some -- not decline year-over-year, but some shortfall in the U.S. because of volume, some shortfall in Europe principally because of price and then shortfall in Asia on volume. If you look at other things, we have taxes which are favorable for us and all the other businesses one month together are probably favorable by a small amount for us overall.
Operator: We'll hear next from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Your volume in tonnage was up 7% and your operating income was up 4%. Why didn't operating income grow faster than volume in tonnage?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so if we take a look at that on the tonnage area, we did have some new plants come onstream in this quarter, which drove the volumes up a little bit for things. We saw steel operating rates improve a little bit in this quarter which drove us up. The other thing which we saw is we did see price declines in natural gas, as you see, which are substantial. So our operating efficiencies, the portion which Air Products puts in its pocket, because we improved the plant as time goes on, they don't have the same value for that. So that -- so those operating efficiencies held down some of the profit gain because it wasn't as large. We had sales decrease and also a little profit decrease from that. So as you see, you see the large impact of natural gas year-over-year in the hydrogen area.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then lastly, what was depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of this year and for the first quarter?
Paul E. Huck: Okay, let me get it. So I've got to look at the depreciation and amortization here for the second quarter. I think I got the year-to-date numbers here, Jeff. Jeff, if we could and have a follow-up conversation rather than here. I don't have those numbers directly in front of me. I only have the year-to-date. But Simon and Ken can walk you through those things. I know that you've had questions before on that number. One of the things that's happening, because of the impact of the capital leases, our depreciation and amortization really aren't growing. I know for a year-to-date basis, we're down about $8 million in D&A. A good portion of that being currency for us, just lowering that, having a stronger dollar. And then the other -- and then -- but if I looked at replacements and I looked at additions to D&A, and they pretty much offset one another. So things which -- and not replacements, but D&A which just actually went off the scale. And the things which were fully depreciated or retired and then the new -- and they're about the same for the quarter. And the reason why is that we aren't getting the capital leases, they don't go through depreciation, and that represents about $200 million, $300 million of our CapEx, so a fairly substantial large portion of our growth CapEx. And then we're also signing contracts for a longer period. If I go back 15 and 20 years or so when these -- when our original plants were put on depreciation, we pretty much had 15-year contracts. Now a lot of the hydrogen business, a lot of the gasification business are there signing up the 20-year contracts for these, so it's just a longer period over which the plants get depreciated.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Jim Sheehan sitting in for Dave. Just wondering if you will become any more bullish on construction end market demand for performance materials?
Paul E. Huck: As far as that is concerned within the U.S., I still remain a skeptic on the residential construction, which gets into insulation and things like that which we sell things in. I think a bigger bull is in the automotive area for us and the construction for nonresidential for us and seeing that for the coatings aspect of things. So we are more of a bull there.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then just with respect to the remaining Homecare assets, do you have any further updates on timing for those?
Paul E. Huck: So yes, and we would expect them to -- and we would expect to complete a sale before March of 2013, hopefully before that. We have buyers who we are currently talking to. We're taking them through a process of taking a detailed -- a look at the business, trying to prepare them to give us bids. And so that's what we'll probably spend the next couple of months doing. And I'll have more to say about that in July as far as the timing is concerned to see how those bids go.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the weakness in volumes in the U.S. and Canada. Looked like the volume decline accelerated to down 2% from down 1% in the first quarter. It's a little bit of a contrast to some of the other companies we're hearing where their U.S. business is doing fairly well and actually showing some signs of improvement. So I know you kind of mentioned some issues with signing new customers up. Is it a matter of not having enough salespeople or not having the tenure of the salespeople about right or just some hesitancy on your clients' part? Or how would you kind of attribute the accelerating decline there?
Paul E. Huck: Simon, why don't you take that?
Simon R. Moore: Brian, good question. A couple of points there. And again, we just wanted to make the point that since we don't consolidate our Mexico results, our LOX/LIN volumes would've been up 6% year-on-year if we included that on a North America basis, so that's one factor. Let me just talk about a couple of things that did hold down the growth there. As you remember, we reported very strong contract signings in the third and fourth quarter of last year, so our second half. It takes a while for those customer volumes to come onstream and start to show up in our sales. And as Paul mentioned, that's been happening a little bit more slowly than we expected. So still a very strong leading indicator, and we expect to see that over future quarters. Again, we signed -- we were back to the very high levels of contract signings this quarter which bodes very well for the future. Another factor was helium supply. As I mentioned, we now don't expect our new helium plant to be onstream this fiscal year. That's unfortunate because we certainly could have sold more helium if we had that product available. Our plant is ready and we're awaiting feedstock from our supplier. So again, I think in the long term, the signs are positive with new contract signings, but in the near term, we were held back by lower signings from earlier last year and helium availability.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that helps. And then on the $60 million of annualized cost savings, is the bulk of that in the merchant segment because that's where Homecare was or will there be some in the other segments? And what would be the timing in 2013 when you'd expect to kind of fully realize that on a run rate basis?
Paul E. Huck: Okay, yes. And the bulk of the savings will come in the merchant area. The -- where the rule of the stranded cost will help -- will also help impact the other segments, but principally the savings are principally targeted in the merchant area for that. As we enter 2013, we are going to have the bulk of this -- of the people out the door and the other actions which we need to take to lower costs done by the end of the year. And so I would say we're going to have almost all of that as savings in 2013.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: You'd say between that and the use of the proceeds from the sale which you could use to either pay down debt or not take out -- not take on debt that you otherwise would've taken on. That combination will still make the 2013 EPS kind of neutral from a divestiture or the reclassification?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. If we take and we look at the cost reduction in total and the paydown in debt, it will actually -- it will come and it should improve our earnings overall with that.
Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just one housekeeping thing. What's the right first quarter EPS number for STUs to get to the new $5.47 to $5.60 number?
Paul E. Huck: $1.26.
Operator: We'll hear next from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I guess first on the CapEx backlog. I mean, you were far enough into the year. Do you have a sense for how much of a tailwind you'll have next year just from on-site projects coming onstream?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. If we look at projects which will come onstream next year and I just estimate that, it's around $0.35 for 2013 over 2012 and that could still grow a little bit.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then given the ramp in your capital spending, it seems reasonable to assume that 2014 will be higher than 2013. Is that fair?
Paul E. Huck: It should be, yes.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And how are you thinking about merchant margins like where you can get them to over the next couple of years? So if you look a little bit farther out, I mean, what do you need to see to see margins inch up again?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so our 2015 goals with regard to margins stay intact, Laurence, so we still think that -- and we are trying to get the merchant margins to the 21% to 24% range, which we talked about that. And we realized that, that's a lot of improvement as people look at the margin today. However, we've got the load, we have plants to load in the U.S., we got plants to load in Asia. That comes at a -- the incremental margin in those areas is about 35%. The bulk of our unloading capacity sits in merchant for us as we look at it, so we got good things there. And we got improvements to make in Europe. We got the cost reduction which will come in and will help in this year and next. And we also have in Europe programs to get -- to continue to get our prices up. That's not going -- as I said before, it's not going to be a quick program, but it's going to be over a number of years for us to get our prices higher there.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then lastly, this natural gas efficiency issue in hydrogen has been coming up more frequently. Do you have a rough rule of thumb for if there's a $1 per million BTU swing in natural gas prices? I mean, what that means for your earnings?
Paul E. Huck: For us, it really depends upon the contract and the customer at that point in time and the plants in which we're operating. A thing which will help us with this whole thing is by us being able to operate our most efficient plants on the -- as soon as we get the pipeline connector put together, so that will take some of this out of it because we currently have 2 systems. When we combine them as one, we can always operate the most efficient plant as far as savings is concerned. And so -- and that's a benefit which we have. The rules of thumb which we have, they always break down whenever I go into the details, so I don't want to give you one because I have to always look at all the individual plants ourselves, Laurence.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Well, maybe to come at it from another angle, if I may. If -- does this imply that there's a further headwind to show up in the back half of the year because of contracts rolling over? Or are we now through this?
Paul E. Huck: No, no, no. It doesn't have anything to actually do with contracts rolling over because we passed this -- we passed the price increases through, based upon the cost that we pay for the gas and the month in which we supply it. So we are matched perfectly here. It just says that if I save money, if I make my plant more efficient and improve the heat rate of the reformer so that I don't have to put as much gas through to make the hydrogen, I get a savings for that the way I bill the customer because I take the efficiency risk. And so it's not a huge amount on these things -- for these things, but it is -- but when gas moves and you got gas basically at $4 in the prior year and gas below $3 in this year and about $2.50 or so, you're going to see some movement in profit because you don't save as much money when you do that and so that's the factor there. I mean, you're talking about the difference between the 7% volume growth and 4% operating income growth here so it's not a huge factor for that. And there's a few other things that are in there, but that was the bigger factor.
Operator: We'll hear next from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Christopher Perella: This is Chris Perella on for Kevin. Just wanted to follow up on the timing of the tonnage bonuses and the outlook for next quarter. And also what the growth trends you see in the tonnage business as that volume ramps up.
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so for -- in this area, what happens is that we earn a bonus based upon our reliability and our supply, so we -- and so that occurs across the year. So if your contract started on the 1st of February, we earn that bonus on the 31st of January. We don't accrue it throughout the year, stuff like that. We book it in the month which we'd earn it, so that will be something which -- in which would be booked in January. We have more contracts which have their anniversary date in the first calendar quarter than in any other. They occur in all quarters, so we earn bonuses every month. It just happens to when the anniversary date of those contracts happen and so we have that, and that produces some of the volatility from quarter-to-quarter. It does not produce volatility much from year-to-year. We have consistently grown bonuses as our reliability is very good in this business. And as we continue to add to this business, those bonuses are going to grow, but it doesn't produce volatility really from year to year. It does put some volatility in the year for us. As we look at growth for things, the largest plant which we have coming onstream, well, it's already onstream. Towards the end of the second quarter was our hydrogen plant, Luling, so we'll see the impact of that. The other major onstreams really occur for us in 2013. So as far as growth is concerned, we would expect to see good growth in our tonnage business. A lot of this depends upon gas prices and power prices as to what gets passed through. But long term, as we look at volume growth in this business, we think our volumes in this business are going to grow in the low double-digits.
Christopher Perella: Okay. In the longer term?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, that's right. But as we look out at 2013, 2014, 2015, we think we're set up to grow at that rate in this business.
Christopher Perella: All right. And then as a follow-up, in Merchant Gases in North America. With the low utilization rate on the assets and the, I guess, the slow pickup, not in customer signings but those customers actually coming online, is there any restructuring to do to rightsize that business?
Paul E. Huck: No.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You mentioned in your comments that Asian volumes did not come up the way that you would expect it post-Chinese New Year. And I'm wondering if you could just sort of contextualize what you're hearing from your customers about that? And then other companies and other industries have mentioned that they saw sequential improvement in Asian volumes throughout the quarter and then so far into April so maybe you could comment on that as well.
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so if I take a look at Asia, certainly, March was better than February and January with those things. And so -- and April looks, so far, to be pretty good and we'll see what actually comes up. But the point being is that we didn't get to the point which we would've expected to get to, to start the third quarter for things. So it was a relative disappointment for us. Certainly, our March volumes were better than the volumes we saw in February.
Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And was it just sort of -- what caused that delay? Anything specific from your customers or things we should be looking out for or just was it sort of general malaise that we saw sort of everywhere?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so I think everyone is looking, and a lot of this is China. For us, some of this is electronics volumes, but a lot of this is China, when you look at what is happening. And I think everyone has made comments on China being slow. The official stats are higher than what people are observing right now. So the official stats on manufacturing and stuff like that, look high. It's not what everyone's seeing in their volumes.
Operator: We'll hear next from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Paul, question on 2015 by 2015. You reiterated your confidence in hitting those targets but you've lost the year, and certainly, I would imagine that fiscal '12 has turned out a lot poorer than you thought back in June of last year. So what gives you the confidence that in this reduced time frame, you can still hit those goals? Is it better-than-expected wins on the tonnage side of the business or other factors that continue to give you confidence?
Paul E. Huck: And John, you're right. 2012, it has not been according to the plan that we have so that's the thing. So the confidence which we have, as we look at this, is that our capital spending, which is going to drive our growth and give us the plants in the tonnage area to serve our customers with, has gone along according to our plans. We've had some acquisitions in this year so we're starting to fill that pipeline also which was in there. And so we are behind in both areas, namely merchant and electronics in this year as I talked of that. We can recapture that, and we can load those plants because we still have the same amount of capital going into the businesses. It's just going to take stronger growth. Electronics, it does go up and down as far as growth is concerned. So at some point between now and 2015, we'll probably see some very strong quarters as far as growth is concerned. In the merchant area, we're putting a lot of emphasis on the U.S., a lot of emphasis on Asia on getting and loading up and loading our plants there. And I think you'll start to see some improvements in quarter 3 and quarter 4 there. We think we can do some things to solve the problems on helium, which Simon talked about a little bit between now and 2015 to get us more product which will help us. So I think a lot of the things which have held back the growth are things which -- in which we can address. And of course, obviously, the cost always sits within the things which we need to do, and we're making progress there, too.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: A follow-up on merchant. Back when you had 20% merchant operating margins, what would that margin have been pro forma for not having health care? And then also, Simon, if you could just tell us, you told us what LOX/LIN volumes would be pro forma Mexico. What would your North American operating rate be in merchant if you included Mexico?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. So as far as the -- what happens in the merchant margins, they have probably -- we are probably down a few tenths depending upon the individual quarter, it's anywhere from 2/10 to 3/10 to maybe 4/10 -- 2/10 to 4/10 of an impact there. It's not -- it isn't going to be huge on that. Doesn't change our view of where we need to go. Simon, as far as operating rates.
Simon R. Moore: Yes. And certainly, operating rates will be higher in Mexico as we have that growth, but certainly, there would still be a lot of opportunity to load up the assets in U.S. and Canada. The opportunity stays the same because you're not going to move -- you're not going to change the direction of the products there.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of getting your margins back up in merchant, if I did the math, I guess the cost-saving efforts that you're undergoing should probably get you back to that 19%, 20% range, I suppose, and then the loadings and maybe new wins over the next couple of years gets you to your goal in '15. Is that how the math works?
Paul E. Huck: You're right. The cost savings in Europe, obviously, are one thing. Now the other thing is we continue to drive costs across every region, so we're looking for cost savings in Asia and the U.S. But here, we have a onetime -- we're actually changing the size of the business and the structure of the business there so -- and that's why the charge. But we're always going to be looking for cost savings on things. And then loading, loading is important for us. Improving the price in Europe is also important for us, too, Mike. So it should get us there right, the 21% to 24%.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, got it. And then just for my understanding, are Europe margins significantly lower than what you're seeing now and that's where the big sort of lever will be over the next couple of quarters once you get the cost savings through?
Paul E. Huck: The margins right now, the margin in this quarter was 17.3%. We aren't very happy with that margin, obviously. That's the lowest margin we've seen in a long time in the business. We intend to get that -- to move that better.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then last question. When you think about electronics as you head into '13 and '14, what would you need to see sort of overall to start to see volume growth return to the levels that you need to hit your 2015 plans?
Paul E. Huck: And we think the industry should be growing for us somewhere in the high single-digits, so somewhere between 8% and 10%, let's say or so, for electronics growth because the gases into that are going to grow faster, they always have.
Operator: We'll hear next from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. Quick question on M&A. Could you talk a little bit about the health of your M&A pipeline? And now that NanoMaterials is closed, are there opportunities for further consolidation on some of your JV -- other JVs?
Paul E. Huck: Well, if you take a look at our JVs, we obviously have always said we want to buy them. We don't have anything active going with any of them right now on those things. It depends upon the partner for us on those things. But they typically occur very quickly, so it's not going to be something which is going to be subject to a long negotiation and bid process. The ones which I've been involved with since I've been here, things like Korea and Taiwan, Malaysia and stuff like that, they all have occurred very quickly for us.
Abhiram Rajendran - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then one just quick follow-up. On the photovoltaics market, do you have any color on that area in terms of what you're seeing by way of utilization rates or potential excess capacity out there in the market?
Paul E. Huck: The market is very slow right now on PV. What they had was a lot of incentives which were in there. The governments have taken back a lot of those incentives because they couldn't afford them. And so there is excess capacity to make PV panels.
Simon R. Moore: And Abhi, just a reminder, PV is about 5% of our electronics sales.
Operator: We'll hear next from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Paul, you mentioned the slowness in China and perhaps the macro there -- data there understates the micro weakness. Given the similar softness you see there, are you hearing from any customers rethinking some of the projects in the backlog?
Paul E. Huck: No, no, we are not. A lot of the projects in the backlog really get around producing feedstocks which are needed to generate power, produce chemicals, replace imports of LNG and stuff like that. So I would be surprised to actually see anybody back off there.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I might have missed this, but did you provide a regional breakdown for volume trends in tonnage, and what were they in North America, Europe and Asia?
Paul E. Huck: We did not. We typically -- we try to take a look at that business in total.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Would the -- is it fair to say that European tonnage volumes would be down year-over-year? And if they were, are there any customers that are nearing take-or-pay provisions or below take-or-pay?
Paul E. Huck: For us, in Europe, the -- our business is principally -- a lot of it is hydrogen also in Rotterdam, and those customers are not anywhere near their take-or-pay so we don't have any concerns there.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, got it. And just finally on electronics. Could you just educate me on what's happening on the semi side? I mean, that's where the biggest variance was to your change in outlook. It sounds like that's -- the semiconductor side is doing weaker than the consumer electronics side. Why was MSI down so much, for example?
Paul E. Huck: And so I think it just had to do with a lot of pullback related to things like what happened in Japan, what happened in Thailand as far as flooding is concerned so people were trying to be cautious, watch their inventories. Inventories are not high in the semi space. And so as we look at this, we think we are poised to take off and have a very good year. Last year was unusual. Last year, in quarter 1 and quarter 2, they kind of built through the cycle because of the recovery which occurred in the business. And so in this year, we saw more of a normal cycle and so we didn't see the build-through, and so we saw the drops year-on-year. But we do think that and that we're poised here to see a return here in quarter 3 and quarter 4.
Operator: And our final question today comes from Mark Gulley with Gulley and Associates.
Mark Gulley: I want to follow up on merchant, if I could. Paul, you had talked about really beefing up the sales force, more feet on the street, those kinds of things with respect to merchant. Are you happy with your progress there? Or do you think there's more resources you have to commit to make that happen?
Paul E. Huck: I think we have done well as far as putting the people or the feet on the street in the right spots. I'm happy with the signings which we've had. And the thing which I said is that we have seen the loading of the new business which we signed be a lot slower than what we typically would expect to see. I can't tell you why, Mark, yet. We don't really know. You've got to look at that on a customer-by-customer basis. The only thing which I could attribute it to, in general, is that within the U.S., manufacturers are still very, very -- they -- and cautious around trying to overbuild or build inventory and stuff like that, so people are just being cautious about things. And so I think we still have that which is occurring with our customers, and so typically, we would see a customer go and then ramp his plant very quickly as he put an addition on it or he made a change. We aren't seeing those plants load as quick.
Mark Gulley: And a housekeeping thing. You have a gain on the purchase of DuPont's interest in the Nano joint venture. Can you help me understand how you have a gain on purchase?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, it's the way the accounting works. And so what happens is, is you write your existing asset, your existing investment up to market. So whatever I paid to DuPont, it used to be I could take the 50% which I held and keep it at historic costs, now I write that up to market. And so in that write-up to market, I get a gain and I run it through the income statement. I just don't make an entry to equity.
Operator: And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Moore and Mr. Huck, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing or final remarks.
Simon R. Moore: Okay, thanks, Deanna. Thanks, everybody. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. Thank you for joining us and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Simon R. Moore: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products First Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our Q1 results and outlook for the remainder of 2012. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website. Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3 for a review of our first fiscal quarter of 2012.  For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 1% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 1% year-on-year on higher prices in our Merchant Gases and performance materials businesses. While overall volumes were flat, volumes were higher from new plants in Tonnage Gases but were offset by lower equipment sales and lower volumes in our performance materials and Merchant Gases businesses.  Sequentially, sales declined 7% with volumes down 4% due to seasonality in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant Gases segments. Merchant volumes declined more than we expected as we experienced weakness in Asia, including China. Simon will provide the geographic details later.  Sequentially, lower energy prices reduced sales growth by 1% and currency reduced sales growth by 2%. At the current rates, currency would be a headwind for the remainder of 2012. Operating income of $385 million decreased 5% from prior year due primarily to lower volumes in our equipment and Merchant Gases segments. Higher pricing did not fully recover raw material increases, but productivity offset this impact. Our operating margin declined to 15.9%, down 100 basis points versus prior year and was 60 basis points due to volume and the rest due to under recovery of raw material increases. For the quarter, net income decreased 1% while diluted earnings per share increased by 1% due to share repurchases. Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous or run-rate basis dropped to 12.2%. On an annual basis, return on capital employed is 13%.  Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. As we announced back in October, we settled the dispute in Spain where the authorities disallowed certain deductions taken by the company's Spanish subsidiaries in fiscal years 2005 to 2011. This $44 million or $0.20 per share charge is excluded from our quarter 1 EPS analysis. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.01. Lower volumes decreased earnings per share by $0.05 year-on-year. Pricing, energy and raw materials, taken together, reduced EPS by $0.02. And costs were $0.02 favorable as our productivity gains more than offset cost inflation. Currency translation and foreign exchange taken together had a $0.02 unfavorable impact. Equity affiliate income was $0.03 higher as the prior year had a charge for a plant sale within one of our Asian affiliates. Excluding the Spanish tax settlement and as we guided to last quarter, our effective tax rate of 23.5% contributed about $0.02. For fiscal year 2012, we still expect the rate to be in the range of 25% to 26%. And finally, fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.03.  Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases.  Merchant Gases' overall sales of $989 million and underlying sales were both unchanged from prior year with positive pricing offset by lower volumes. Sequentially, sales declined 5% due to a 3% unfavorable currency impact and lower volumes partially due to seasonality. Pricing was positive. Merchant Gases' operating income of $192 million was down 4% versus prior year and flat sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.4% was down 90 basis points compared to last year but up 100 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, operating income declined on lower volumes particularly in our European liquid/bulk and packaged gas businesses. Our cost performance improved significantly this quarter but did not overcome the volume decline. The startup of our new LaPorte ASU this quarter helped alleviate the liquid argon sourcing challenges we had previously experienced. Versus prior quarter, the improved operating and distribution cost performance offset lower volumes and unfavorable currency as operating income was flat. And the 100 basis point improvement in operating margin versus prior quarter resulted from the improved operating and cost performance, more than overcoming the impact of lower volumes. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6.  In U.S./Canada, sales improved 2% versus prior year. Volumes were down 1% on weakness in food, medical, electronics and distributors. Helium sourcing challenges continued. We expect our new U.S. helium facility to be onstream late in our second quarter as we are awaiting feedstock from our supplier. Pricing was 3% positive with improvement across the product lines as we took actions to recover higher costs. LOX/LIN capacity utilization is in the low 70s. Contract signings were below recent high levels but our prospect pipeline remains robust, and we expect strong signings next quarter and through the rest of the year. In Europe, sales decreased 2% versus last year. Volumes were down 2%, partially due to business we've shed to improve profitability in the region, as well as weakness in the packaged gas market. Pricing was positive in liquid/bulk and packaged gases but partially offset by continued negative price pressure in Homecare, the business we announced we are divesting. LOX/LIN plant loadings are in the low 80s, and new contract signings were strong this quarter.  In Asia, sales were up 2% versus last year, with underlying sales flat, which is a change from the strong growth trend we had been experiencing. Overall, volumes were up 1%. LOX/LIN volumes were up 2%, excluding conversions as we experienced weaker steel and PV markets notably in China. Packaged gas volumes increased on continued growth of our micro bulk product line, and helium volumes were lower as product availability limited sales. Pricing was down 1% on lower liquid argon pricing due to prior year price premiums in the China spot market. Plant loadings are around 80%. New contract signings were roughly equal to the last few quarters. We expect signings will improve through the year, driven in part by China taking action to stimulate their economy. This quarter, we continued to win business in key emerging markets. In December, we announced that INOX Air Products, our joint venture in India, will build 2 new air separation units for the growing merchant market in West and South India. One of the units will also supply nitrogen to Posco Maharashtra Steel for their Phase 2 expansion. We will also supply hydrogen to Posco from 2 steam methane reformers. We also signed a contract to provide our integrated oxy-fuel solution to Techpack in Korea. We will install a VSA non-cryogenic oxygen production unit. It will control skid and our clean fire burners to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency and productivity for their glass production. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $810 million increased 6% versus last year, with volumes up 6% driven by new plants. Sequentially, sales were down 8%. Volumes were down 2%, and we saw a 4% decline from lower energy pass-through. Operating income of $111 million declined 4% versus prior year as higher maintenance costs more than offset the contribution from new plants. As expected, operating income declined sequentially due to higher maintenance spending, favorable gases contract modifications in the prior quarter and an unfavorable polyurethane intermediates contract modification this quarter. Operating margin of 13.8% decreased 130 basis points versus prior year and 340 basis points sequentially on the lower operating income.  During our Investor Conference last year, we shared our view of the significant opportunity in the China market and specifically, large on-site oxygen for coal gasification. We are pleased to have announced another project in this important market segment. Last month, we announced the largest single on-site ASU order ever awarded to supply Shaanxi Future Energy Chemical Company in Yulin, Shaanxi Province, China. This multiple train project will produce 12,000 tons per day of oxygen and large quantities of nitrogen and compressed dry air for Shaanxi's coal to chemical plant. Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $535 million were up 2% compared to last year on 1% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales were down 9% on lower seasonal semiconductor volumes and soft demand across the LED, display and solar markets. Electronics sales were up 4% compared to last year and down 7% sequentially on seasonality and slower market growth as we expected. Electronic materials sales were down slightly versus last year, while tonnage and equipment were higher. Electronics materials pricing was stable. Performance materials sales decreased 1% versus last year, with 4% higher prices and a 1% positive currency effect, mostly offsetting a 6% volume decline. Sequentially, sales were down 11% primarily on volume declines. The softness reflects seasonal slowdowns in key markets, including housing and construction. Operating income of $78 million was up 13% versus prior year, and the segment operating margin improved 150 basis points to 14.6% on improved cost performance. Sequentially, operating income was down 15%, and the operating margin declined 100 basis points primarily due to lower volumes. In new projects, we announced the onstream of the world's first on-site electronics gas plant to supply high-purity ammonia for Sanan OptoElectronics' LED production in Anhui Province, China. To support Sanan's expansion plans, we will be building a second high-purity ammonia plant at their site. Bringing in the stability and scale of the on-site business model to electronics gases is a success for both Air Products and Sanan. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $89 million were down 21% versus prior year on lower ASU and LNG sales. Sequentially, sales declined 7% on lower LNG sales. Operating income of $7 million was down 64% versus prior year and down 37% sequentially due primarily to lower project activity. Profitability has bottomed in this segment, and while it should remain at approximately this level for the next few quarters, we expect some improvement in our fourth quarter based on anticipated orders. Backlog is up 48% over last year primarily on new ASU orders. Bidding activity remains strong, and we hope to announce several LNG orders shortly. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Please turn to Slide 10. Before we discuss our outlook, let me make some comments on the sale of our Continental European Homecare business. Earlier this month, we announced that we reached agreement with Linde [ph] to acquire our Homecare business in Spain, Germany, France, Belgium and Portugal subject to regulatory agreement and employee consultation. Both of these processes are underway and on a timeline to close the transaction by the end of March. The deal has conditions to modify the price based upon future business results and receivables collections. Therefore, it is too early for us to give you a reasonable estimate of the gain which we will book. We have also decided to exit our remaining Homecare businesses. In the second quarter, we will begin accounting for the Homecare business in total as a discontinued operation. As we finalize our restatement, we will provide history for people to update their models. Also, in quarter 2, we will begin taking cost-reduction actions and plan to record a charge for cost reduction in our second quarter results. The charge will cover reductions needed to remove stranded cost resulting from our exit from the Homecare business. This will involve cost reductions in our corporate, regional and Merchant Gases area as we take actions to remove the cost, which Linde and other potential purchasers will not assume. The charge will also cover cost reduction necessary to appropriately size our European business cost structure in light of the European economic recession. I know everyone has questions as to the size of the reduction, the cost and the benefits. We will detail that information later once we have everything finalized. For 2012, we expect that the sale of our Homecare business will be modestly dilutive to our earnings per share for continuing operations. We will take actions to remove the stranded costs, buyback shares and pay down debt with the proceeds that should make the transaction neutral to fiscal 2013's earnings per share for continuing operations. Now let me give you a brief summary of our economic outlook. As we told you last quarter, we expect that the first half of our fiscal year would be slower in the U.S. and Asia, and that Europe would be in a recession. We also expected that the second half of our fiscal year would be much stronger as economic activity picks up in the U.S. and Asia. So far, we have seen that scenario play out, with continued slow growth in the United States and Asia seeing a slowdown, particularly in China as policymakers took actions to control inflation. Europe continued to decline. We expect that these conditions will continue through our second quarter.  Looking to the second half of our fiscal year, we believe that we should start to see improvements in both the U.S. and Asia. For the U.S., as the election draws closer, the debates have changed to how we can create jobs faster. This should improve both consumer and business confidence, thereby strengthening the recovery. For Asia, we have seen some easing of inflation in China. Going forward, during the second half of the year, we expect policymakers to shift their focus from fighting inflation to increasing growth. Asia will also benefit as the U.S. economy strengthens. For Europe, we expect the second quarter to be the trough. However, recessionary conditions will remain throughout the rest of the year.  In terms of Air Products, our capital expenditure guidance remains robust and unchanged at $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, up from last year's $1.6 billion. And with one quarter completed, we are keeping our earnings guidance unchanged as well. Our earnings per share full year guidance range remains at $5.90 to $6.30. Now let's turn to our second quarter outlook. Please turn to Slide 11. Our guidance for quarter 2 is for earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.43 based on the following factors: On the positive side, in Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect higher volumes as the first quarter is typically seasonally lower. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to improve on higher operating bonuses and lower maintenance costs and also, less of an impact from our polyurethane intermediates contracting renegotiation. Higher volumes from new plant onstreams, including our new hydrogen plant in Rotterdam and our new ASU in LaPorte, Texas, will also contribute. Merchant volumes should improve in the U.S./Canada as we see the impact of our fiscal 2011 new business signings partially offsetting this sequential improvement. Our effective tax rate for fiscal quarter 2 should come in between 25% to 26%. This will be a $0.03 to $0.05 headwind. We expect the Lunar New Year to negatively impact Asia volumes, and we expect currency to be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind next quarter. Just to clarify, at this time, the guidance for both the next quarter and the full year include the Homecare business. Now let me wrap up. Quarter 1 started off our fiscal year as we expected. Our project backlog is strong and now totals just over $2.5 billion, a similar level to last quarter with the addition of new air separation unit projects in China, offsetting the onstream of our hydrogen plant in Rotterdam and our air separation unit in LaPorte, Texas. You can see a list of our major projects on backup Slide #13. Our recent orders, combined with the strong bidding activity, gives us a solid outlook for future growth. As we move forward, our priority remains to deliver the growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment choice in the industry for our shareholders. 2012 will certainly offer its challenges. However, we believe we are well positioned to make the progress we need to make to deliver our 2015 goals. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Mark to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can you talk about Asian demand generally in that you talked about a flatness in your Asian merchant growth? And in the old days, when China would slow down or Asia would slow down, maybe volume growth used to be mid-single digits and now it seems much slower than that. How do you read it? Or how do you read the differences in your Asian end markets?
Paul E. Huck: Well, if you take a look, Jeff, I think what you have to remember -- I think for us is that we do have an electronics business in Asia, which last year grew from quarter 4 to quarter 1. And so -- and that also included the impact which occurs in the merchant area. This year, electronics did what it normally does from quarter 4 to quarter 1, is it contracted. So that's probably one of the big factors. It's that we were seeing the growth of electronics and we didn't see the same level of seasonality which we normally see for things. On top of that, we have also seen our volumes in China slow. And I mentioned that in my remarks principally because the interest rates have been raised a lot in China to kind of control inflation. We have seen inflation start to ease. So we don't think it's a long-term condition for them to tighten up the money supply. And that should ease sometime late quarter 2, or time is our guess. So probably not right post the Chinese New Year, with timing some time right now, we're forecasting in the March timeframe. Those are the 2 big factors for us as we look at that.
Simon R. Moore: Jeff, also just a reminder too that obviously, we continue to enjoy success in our tonnage volumes. Your question was appropriately more about the merchant with new business and new project onstream there. So we do see some strong activity on our tonnage business in Asia and China as we expected.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then lastly, if -- your depreciation charges were down year-over-year in the quarter. And I think the Praxair numbers, maybe they run sort of up high single digits. Is there something different in your business versus their business which is leading to a more level or down depreciation number for you?
Paul E. Huck: So -- and we have taken a look at that as to why that happens, Jeff, a couple of factors, which we'll go in. First, the currency aspect of things. So as the currency -- as the dollar tends to strengthen, which it did this quarter, it's going to drive the depreciation from our overseas facilities down a little bit with that. So there's -- that does not have an equalization of it. Plus the other thing which we have seen over time is that we have seen some facilities roll off their depreciation. So we have seen that occur. Those facilities are still operating. Obviously, it helped our margins with -- rolling forward. Plus a good portion of our capital spending right now, you can see this in the capital lease element of things. That does not get recorded through the depreciation accounts anymore. And so that's the other factor. Depending upon the -- but the way in which we treat the one-on-one on-sites does not lead to depreciation. So a lot of the large gasification plants are not going to have depreciation associated with them. It's going to have a capital receivable, which gets booked as an asset instead of PP&E and then that flows through.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Paul, your performance materials business continues to underperform the electronics portfolio. Is this really a core business for you given all kinds of opportunities that you have in your industrial gases business?
Paul E. Huck: Well, what you're talking about on the performance materials, P.J., they had a sequential downturn in volumes and a year-on-year downturn on volumes. The profitability and returns in that business are still very good for us. And so as we look at this, we think it is still an excellent business. It is not a business which introduces a lot of ups and downs and cyclicality to Air Products for things. As we look at this, we don't have large swings really in that much in our volumes overall in the business. We continue to see opportunities to get our products formulated in and to make them a steady cash flow for us. So we're happy with the business. We think it's performed very well. And so for right now, the answer is yes.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then if you look at the commentary from semiconductor companies in January, it does materially improve and they're seeing some at the bottom. So when should you begin to see that improvement in your numbers? And what are your expectations for square inches of silicon this year?
Paul E. Huck: So as far as that's concerned, and I'll let Simon chime in here too, what we would expect is really to have a much stronger second half than the first half period. So it's probably a few months' lag on that. Simon, you are close to the business?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. Thanks, P.J. And I mean, we would still say for the year, we expect square inches of silicon to grow in that 0% to 5% range, probably right in the middle of that, which is what we've talked about last quarter. And as you pointed out, I think generally speaking, Intel talked about a stronger second half. TSMC actually talked about having a better first calendar quarter than seasonality would expect. And just one statement that we talked about a few times is our strength with Samsung, Intel and TSMC. They're expected to be almost half of the industry CapEx in 2012. So we continue to benefit from our strong position with them.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just lastly, housekeeping. You had that slide on the project backlog. None of those projects were in Europe. So I was wondering what percent of your project backlog is in Europe.
Paul E. Huck: Yes, it is a small amount, I know, of our capital spending, P.J. I think our capital spending is somewhere about 10% to 15% of our CapEx for growth. Next year is in Europe, I guess 12% or something like that. So it might be 15%, but it's not a huge amount for that right now.
Simon R. Moore: And obviously, we brought on the big hydrogen plant in Rotterdam. We do have the one large oxygen plants in Europe that will come onstream in 2013.
Paul E. Huck: But that shouldn't surprise anyone. And given the European economy right now, when you look at things, they're not adding a lot of industrial capacity.
Operator: And our next question will come from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: For Paul, I won't be able to ask you anymore when you're going to sell off European healthcare, but I will ask you what you're going to do with polyurethanes. It seems to be a drag on the tonnage business and has very inconsistent results. Is that business making money? And tell us more about this negative contract modification you had. And then one follow-on for merchant. Your U.S. operating rate seems stuck in the low 70s. Is there a need for some capacity rationalization to get that operating rate up?
Paul E. Huck: Okay. First, with regard to polyurethane intermediates, as you know, we said this before, it's not a business in which we're investing in. We don't see the opportunity to extend in the model which we have. So we have some contracts which we are working through at this point in time. The business -- as far as today is concerned, the returns on the business are still very good. Our contracts are still very good, we think. So as far as the drag, yes, it might be a drag on growth. But a drag of the profits, no for us. And we continue to look at our options going forward for that business, but it's not a business which obviously we're going to be investing in. We can extend the model to Asia. And most of the PUI -- and most of the TDI production is moving to Asia, as you know. If you then turn to and take a look at what's happening in the U.S. in merchant, the capacity rates have been low. We would expect that we would start to see improvements in volumes in this quarter based upon -- in the signings which we have seen. Do we think we need to take capacity out? The answer is no. We believe that there are opportunities to sell that capacity. For us, we don't see any place in which we can't imagine us being able to sell that based upon the applications which we have. It was a question of us on the sales force during the Airgas transaction of not pushing as hard, not replacing people and not trying to grow the sales force. We have taken those actions. We've seen an improvement in signings. We would expect signings to improve in the second quarter of 2012 also.
Simon R. Moore: And Don, I think you also may be asked about the PUI customer, maybe just to kind of go back to that. We talked about that last quarter, and we have one specific customer that we described at last quarter we were concerned about their financial viability. The good news is they're still operating. We did end up renegotiating their contract and sequentially, that was about a $0.03 to $0.04 hit in the tonnage segment. That will not be -- the delta for the year will not be 4x that. So there is significant change for this Q1. And the impact for the rest of the year, Q2 through Q4, is probably a little bit less than it was in Q1. Okay?
Paul E. Huck: Probably -- and to clarify that, there's probably about $0.03 of bad news year-on-year still to come from what was our run rate. However, the run rate on a sequential basis is going to improve in that business.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Duffy Fischer with Barclays Capital.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division: In October, you changed out and installed John in merchant, global merchant, as GM. Can you kind of talk about what we should expect to see differently with him running that business and what you were trying to change by putting a new person in that spot?
Paul E. Huck: Well, I think -- and one of the things, I'd say -- I think we've already talked about it. So we're going to take some actions in Europe to reduce our cost structure in that business. So the focus of the things in which we are trying to improve have been clear from -- for about a year now on that. We're trying to get the volumes up in the United States, and we think we're on the right track to do that. We're trying to get the prices improved in Europe, and we've seen some improvement there. We're trying to get our cost structure improved in Europe, and you'll see some actions coming in the second quarter for that. We're trying to improve the operating performance of the plants, and we've made progress there. You can see that in the cost, in the margins this quarter. And the last thing is improving on the supply of helium. So what we expect is for everyone to execute better.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from John McNulty with Crédit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a couple of quick questions. You indicated that China slowed down a little bit at least in your merchant business based on kind of the overall slowing that the government was putting in place and that you thought that might be short-lived. What are you seeing on the tonnage side in terms of request for proposals and new projects? Have things slowed down there? Or is that the kind of "steady as she goes"?
Paul E. Huck: The answer is yes. We have seen a slowdown in China. It has not affected really on the on-site projects or the equipment projects, which we're chasing there. We still see a good backlog and a lot of bid activity.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just one follow-up question. A lot of the growth or at least a reasonable amount of the growth in the U.S. over the last decade was largely to -- tied to energy efficiency, where natural gas prices were high, oil prices were high and your customers were looking to be more efficient using things like oxygen. With natural gas kind of in the 250 to, say, 275 range, how should we think about the potential hit to your business there, if there is any, kind of looking forward?
Paul E. Huck: So -- as far as people, it certainly is going to have a damper on people trying to increase the efficiency of natural gas because their benefits are going to be lower. Oil is still relatively high as far as you look at that. And other products are still relatively high, which provide energy, electricity prices, albeit a lot, but they're still at high prices for things, especially due to things like environmental rigs or things. So I think there's is going to be some hit to the opportunities for things going forward. But the other thing is that it's going to open up chances for us to do other things with things, and we're exploiting those opportunities there too.
Simon R. Moore: Well, I think we also believe that low energy prices are very good for the economy, which helps provide general economic growth as well.
Operator: Next is David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is James Sheehan sitting in for David. Just with respect to pricing in Europe, you started to see some improvement there on the liquid/bulk side and packaged gases. I'm just wondering about your outlook for pricing going forward given the economic headwinds there. And do you -- can you comment a little bit about what you're continuing to see in terms of competitive pricing pressure?
Paul E. Huck: Okay. As far as the pricing in Europe, we expect that -- and that the prices will continue to improve. There is still cost pressures for us with the need to recover our increased power cost, increased cost of diesel in Europe. So we still see that as a driver for us. As far as the competitive pressure, the business has always been competitive. I think we commented on last quarter is that we see our -- we also see our competitors showing a need for price increases also as everyone isn't happy with their margins and their returns in Europe. So we have seen our competitors raise prices also.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then back on performance materials. We're starting to see some initial signs of maybe a perking up of the construction market. What is your outlook on construction? And do you see any material change going forward in 2012?
Paul E. Huck: The outlook for us in construction, I think, is still -- and we're still -- I'm going to say we're not going to be bullish on that yet as far as that is concerned. Our performance materials business though has performed very well and is prepared to respond to that. I would expect the volumes to grow from quarter 1 to quarter 2 and to continue to grow in quarter 3 to quarter 4.
Operator: Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a question.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: With regard to the European Homecare sale to Linde, what is the amount of cash proceeds that you would expect relative to the sale price of EUR 590 million? And what is your expected split of deployment between share repurchases and debt reduction that might be included in your annual earnings guidance, please?
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Kevin. And so with regard to that, we're going to have to pay taxes on this. Given where we see that today, we think that probably about half of the -- no, excuse me -- if you look at the proceeds, probably about 20% or so is going to wind up going to cash tax payments for us to make, and that will not -- and it isn't the same as booked, obviously, there, because you'll have depreciation in there. And then we will probably come pretty close to half of that being used for share buyback, half of that being used to reduce debt overall.
Simon R. Moore: And just Kevin, I would -- just as a reminder also that we may not see that full level of proceeds as Paul mentioned.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then just to follow up, you've got remaining assets in Brazil, Argentina, United Kingdom. If I understand you correctly, you're moving all of that into discontinued operations in the fiscal second quarter. Maybe if you comment on what prospect of divestiture looks like there and remind us how large those businesses are in the aggregate.
Paul E. Huck: Yes, and so if you look at the business overall for us, about 80% of the business fits on the continent in what we're selling today. The bulk of the rest of it sits in the U.K. And then the business in Ireland, the business in Brazil and Argentina are all small.
Operator: Our next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Paul, I know most of your contracts in tonnage and hydrogen allow for pass-through of gas or electricity. Is there -- are there any opportunities there to harvest certainly the release in gas and maybe some help in electricity? And why wouldn't we have seen more pronounced effect on the margin percentage?
Paul E. Huck: So Bob, what you're saying is that on the drop in gas prices, you're expecting to see a bigger increase in margin percentage on the on-site business on the tonnage. So you have seen -- remember that gas prices have been down for a while now. And so we haven't seen a tremendous difference. If I look at my average gas price from quarter 1 of last year to quarter 1 of this year, gas price is probably down maybe about 7% or 8%. It's not down a huge amount for us. So it's been down for a while. And so I think -- and that play has already come through the margin walk for us.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Can I ask you about the growth path you've laid out, Paul? At -- in one of the positive attributes of the gas industry, it's more stability and steadiness yet. It looks like the guidance implies something around a 20% or 22% lift in second half versus first half of the fiscal year. Is -- do you think there's a great degree of risk there? Is there a historic precedent that gets you comfortable you can see that kind of elevation in the second half? Or how would you characterize the path this year compared to maybe other periods?
Paul E. Huck: Okay. And so I think what we see happening from an economic standpoint is somewhat the reverse of what we saw at 2011. If you go back to the comments which we made on the economy and what we saw in underlying sales growth in 2011, we saw underlying sales growth come out in the first half of the year, 11% to 12%. In the second half of the year, we saw the underlying sales growth dip to -- I think it was 7% in quarter 3, 4% in quarter 4. So we saw a slowdown and most of that, as we look at it, came from the economic picture because we saw economy started to slow around the world. We saw the U.S. growth rates drop, manufacturing wise. We saw Asia started to come off. We certainly saw electronics started to come off in our fourth quarter, I think. So we saw a number of things. And we saw the European economies and start to go into a recession through the last half of 2011. So what we're -- as we look at this, we think 2012, from a growth standpoint, in the first half of the year, because of the carryover from 2011, it doesn't start with a lot of momentum behind it. And the economic picture in the first half of our fiscal year, we think, is slow. However, as I said in my remarks that the policy in the United States, we ought to be start talking as the election starts to become clear and more things turn towards how jobs are going to be created, that should lift consumer confidence, should lift the confidence of businesses to invest. And so we see people start trying to increase production. In Asia, we think that they -- and they've taken steps to fight inflation. We think those steps probably have had the right impact in China, but we also think that China is going to turn to a more stimulative process -- policy. In Europe, quarter 2 is likely to trough. So sequentially, things ought to start be getting better. We'll still be in a recessionary period and down on the comps year-on-year, but sequentially, we'll start -- we should start to see growth after quarter 2. And so as far as the economy is concerned, we think it's down in the second half. So if you want to say risk, yes, there is risk in our economic scenario. If you take a look at our products, typically, our product seasonally has a better second half than first half. So in this year, the impact of the second-half pickup, which we normally see, is also going to be added on to a better economy. So that's why the growth is much stronger for here. We also see a number of plants coming onstream in the second half. You see that in the backup slide. And we expect a pickup in LNG orders, which we think starts to show in the fourth quarter profits in the -- on the equipment business trying to get better. So those are some of the reasons. There is risk on it. Yes, we have made a call on the future of the economy, but we do think that as our future looks, things are likely to get better.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And so Paul, just to conclude there, you would still expect global manufacturing up 2%, 3% or 4%, something like that?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, if you take a look at the economy, then we said we saw global manufacturing up 2% to 5%, we think it's probably coming out close to the middle portion of that range right now for us. The U.S. probably goes -- if the U.S. starts to get better as the fiscal is trying to indicate, it might go to the higher end for the U.S. Europe probably stays to the lower end of our previous forecast.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just 2 quick questions. First, in terms of the equipment business, could you talk about how volume sensitive that business is? And if you got backlog up 40-some percent this quarter, why does profitability not improve until the fourth quarter? And then second question, if you could specifically isolate the impact of higher maintenance cost on the tonnage segment EBIT margin this quarter, that would be great.
Paul E. Huck: And the last one was what? I missed that.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I'm trying to understand exactly what the impact of just the increased maintenance costs were on the tonnage segment EBIT.
Paul E. Huck: Okay. Yes. I'll handle that. I know it's probably $0.02 to $0.03 a share on the EBIT aspect of things, all right? If you take a look at the equipment business end, the issue here for us is -- on the backlog, is the backlog includes LNG orders. It includes the air separation orders. As we consistently said on the LNG side that the profitably for that business is a lot better because we aren't selling a lot of purchase equipment along with the stuff we manufacture unlike we do in the air separation side. So the LNG backlog is actually down for us. And that's why as we look to the future, we are expecting the LNG backlog to pick back up. And when that happens, the profitability in the equipment business will improve.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: I was curious about your comment that you're seeing lower volumes in your U.S. and Canada merchant business, lower volumes to distributors. Given that those distributor customers are typically serving the manufacturing market, which according to all the work we've done suggests things should be pretty strong in the U.S. How do you account for the weakness that you're seeing right now?
Paul E. Huck: And so for us, what we see is that construction markets are still depressed as far as that. And distributor markets tells a lot about construction markets. So we haven't seen a lot of the big pickups in capital spending for us either which -- in the U.S.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And then I wanted to ask also about the tonnage business. Historically, that business had been more stable in terms of the quarter-to-quarter operating income in terms of dollars. And here over the last 3 quarters, we've seen a $40 million swing-up last quarter and back down this quarter. Is this a new pattern of volatility that we're going to see kind of contract modifications, swinging one way or the other or maintenance costs being concentrated in one quarter and not in another? Or do you think this pattern we've seen in the last 3 quarters is a little bit more unusual? I'm just kind of trying to get a little bit better sense of any kind of how to model it going forward?
Paul E. Huck: Okay, Mike. And that's, for us, we have taken a look at that. So I'm going to break it into 2 pieces. The contract mods, there is never a pattern to them. We had an unusual mods, which occurred in the last quarter, in quarter 4, which brought a lot of profit for us. That is not going to happen typically in the business. So I would not say that -- that was a one-time event for things. The other thing which we had in this year is we have the mods to -- on the polyurethane customer, which helped him survive a difficult time. For those things that caused us some profit, it's going to cost us a little bit ongoing, but that also was a one-time item. Now if you turn to does the business have a seasonal pattern? The answer to that is yes on the side of hydrogen, unfortunately, and not so much on the oxygen side. But remember, about 2/3 of the business is hydrogen for us. And so what we see is the bonuses for us peak in quarter -- in our Q4 and the maintenance spending is always the lowest typically in our Q4. And so that's always going to introduce more profit into Q4 for us typically than in the other quarters. So -- but last quarter, we had the impact of the mods, which obviously helped us. They didn't reoccur. The maintenance increased from quarter 4 to quarter 1. So that's why you see the large peak, and then we also -- the large drop. And also, the mods to the polyurethane customer. So quarter 1 was an unusually low quarter, but quarter 4 was an usually high quarter last month. So -- and you're just seeing that. I don't think you're ever going to see swings like that without unusual one-time items happening like, Mike.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: And is maintenance spend typically highest in your fiscal fourth quarter then?
Paul E. Huck: No, it's not. It's typically -- if you look at that, it depends upon when the turns are scheduled. It could be anywhere in quarter 1, quarter 2 or Q3, depending upon how much is due at that particular plant at that particular time for us.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: Okay, all right. And then the last question I had was related to the helium capacity that you're bringing on. Has that been delayed? Or can you maybe update us on the timing of that new capacity in Wyoming?
Paul E. Huck: Okay. And the capacity right now is -- and we are waiting for the crude supply to come from our customers. It's being installed, a gas processing facility. We currently expect that to come onstream at the end of quarter 2.
Operator: And our next question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I guess 2 questions. First, is there any sort of anything unusual on the real estate sale side that will skew free cash flow generation this year?
Paul E. Huck: No.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And secondly, are you seeing any shift in competitor behavior in China that will help sort of make the comparisons easier on the next recovery?
Paul E. Huck: I don't think we're -- as far as China is concerned, the market and the dynamics remain the same. It's a competitive market, and we think we are positioned well and have a good set of products chased in the on-site orders.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: And lastly, can you give an update on what you're seeing on your cement market, customers in North America?
Paul E. Huck: Cement customers. I'm going to pass that to Simon, who will probably handle that in an update with you, okay?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. We'll follow up on that, Laurence. Thanks.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of the operating margin improvement sequentially, first quarter versus the fourth quarter, of merchant, can you give us a little bit more color on the operating performance? Did you cut costs? Were you just running the plants better? And is that 100 basis point improvement somewhat sustainable as we head into the rest of the year?
Paul E. Huck: The answer is yes. It is sustainable. And it didn't come from volume, obviously, as you see that sequentially. And it's by principally -- and the plants going out and running well, we also had, towards the end of the quarter, the argon sourcing improved for us, with the LaPorte being onstream in the U.S. And so that -- and that helped also, of course.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. Then just on tentative basis when you think about electronics here, your fiscal first quarter was good. You've seen a lot of other companies see further destocking or such in the December quarter. Do you feel better as we head into the fiscal second and third that electronics could even pick up sequentially?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, I think it would. Yes, and we believe electronics is going to pick up sequentially, quarter 1 to quarter 2, and even more so in quarter 3 and quarter 4, Mike.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Great. And last question in tonnage, you've got 6% volume growth in the first quarter. Does that number accelerate with the projects coming onstream? Or does that just sort of support that level as the year unfolds?
Paul E. Huck: It should actually get better as the year unfolds for us as far as for this year.
Operator: And our final question will come from Mark Gulley with Ticonderoga Securities.
Mark R. Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: Getting in under the wire, a few questions on tonnage, actually. One is with respect to -- I want to go back to back -- I'm sorry, financial side, the debt pay down. You said the split between share repurchases and debt pay down will be about 50-50. With interest rates so low, Paul, why would you want to pay down any debt whatsoever?
Paul E. Huck: And the thing which we are going to manage, Mark, is we're going to manage to a debt rating for us. And so as we look at our capital spending and everything like that and our cash flows, we have a Eurobond which is coming due in the beginning of April. And we're going to use the bit of proceeds to pay down the Eurobond for us. And then if capital spending needs go up, we will borrow more, but we're managing toward -- right now to be a debt -- to be A rating.
Mark R. Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then my on-site question was this. Given the very low natural gas cost in the U.S., does that affect the economics of refinery of hydrogen enough that stimulates demand? Or is that just a small part of the cost that it's -- it does not really move the needle all that much? I'm talking about customers' economics now.
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And so it is certainly going to help crack spreads for them. It certainly will help if they're going to export products out of the U.S. into other countries for those things. So it does help them in that way, Mark. As far as driving the price of gas down for us overall, it's not going to have a big impact of that, which -- to take gas from $3.50 to $3, it’s not going to do that.
Simon R. Moore: Okay. Thanks, everyone. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00 p.m. today. Thank you. for joining us, and have a great day.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon R. Moore: Thank you, David. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I, will review our fiscal 2011 results and outlook for fiscal 2012. We issued our earnings release this morning. It's available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on our website.  Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release explaining factors that may affect these expectations.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good day, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Please turn to Slide #3 for a review of the key highlights from our fiscal year 2011. Clearly, the top highlight for us in 2011 was the number of new projects we announced over the last 12 months. Some of the larger ones are shown at the top of this slide. For some time, we have been sharing with you that bidding activity for new project remains high and as a validation of that point, our capital project backlog continues to rise and now stands at $2.5 billion. For this year, our capital spending was $1.6 billion, up 22% from 2010 and our outlook is now for this to grow to $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion in 2012. You can see that these projects are aligned with the key growth drivers we discussed at our Investor Conference. Hydrogen and oxygen for energy and environmental markets, nitrogen for electronics and merchant capacity for emerging markets.  Now some financial highlights. We had a strong year, with significant improvement in operating cash flow, up 15%. We increased our dividend for the 29th consecutive year, an increase of 18%. We repurchased $649 million of stock during fiscal year 2011 and announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. And our adjusted earnings per share of $5.73 was up 14%, just above the high end of our original guidance range. On the sustainability front, we renamed the both the Carbon Disclosure Project and Dow Jones Sustainable indices, reflecting the results and leadership we are delivering in this important area.  Turning to Slide #4, sales of $10.1 billion increased 12% as we delivered strong gains across our Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Our underlying sales grew 10%, with volumes up 9% and price up 1%. We delivered good volume growth in a period of modest economic growth driven by strong performance on our Electronics and Performance Materials segment, which posted its second consecutive year of over 20% growth. Volume growth of 11% in Tonnage Gases, principally from new investments and contracts. And in our Merchant segment, growth in Asia was well above 20% with much more modest growth experienced in the U.S. and Europe. Operating income of $1.7 billion grew 13% mainly from better performance in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments.  Our operating margin for the year was 16.6%, a modest improvement from last year. While we attained the highest operating margin in more than a decade, our operating leverage was partially offset by a number of product supply and cost issues in the second half of the year. As a result, we finished short of our 17% target. Looking forward, margin should continue to expand. We have operating leverage in the United States and Europe and we have solutions to our product supply and cost issues. And we remain committed to continuing to drive our cost reductions as we expand our business. Equity affiliates income increased 22% to $154 million this year, due to better results across a number of our joint ventures. The largest improvement came from Mexico, where volumes were significantly higher on strong LOX/LIN and packaged gas sales driven by glass, oil field services, refining and general manufacturing. And most importantly, our annual after-tax return on capital employed improved to 13.3%, 80 basis points above last year.  Please turn to Slide 5. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were 11% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 6% year-on-year due to 4% higher volumes driven by Tonnage Gases, Electronics, Performance Materials and Merchant Gases segments and 2% higher pricing. Operating income of $425 million increased 6% from prior year due primarily to volume growth. Our operating margin declined to 16.3%, down 80 basis points versus prior year with 50 basis points due to currency and higher raw material pass-through and the rest due to price under recovery of cost inflation. For the quarter, net income increased 11% and diluted earnings per share increased by 12%, each versus prior year.  Our return on capital employed on an instantaneous, our run rate basis improved to 13.5%.  Turning to Slide 6 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.16. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-on-year. Pricing, energy and raw materials taken together, were flat and costs were about $0.01 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by cost inflation. Currency translation in foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 favorable impact. Equity affiliate income was $0.07 higher, partially due to better results in Mexico, India, Thailand and South Africa. Equity affiliate income also included a positive of $0.04 of good news from nonoperational items, which was offset by an accounting adjustment of a similar amount in non-controlling interest. Lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding altogether were $0.05 positive.  Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon R. Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 7, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 5% on 4% higher volumes with growth in Asia and U.S./Canada and 1% higher pricing, again, driven by Asia and U.S./Canada. Currency increased sales by 5%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with 3% positive volume, flat pricing and a minus 1% currency impact. Just to note, we are now using the term U.S./Canada rather than North America to more accurately reflect the countries we are reporting. Our strong business in Mexico is reported as an equity affiliate so it's not included in these results. Merchant Gases' operating income of $192 million was up 4% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.4% was down one 110 basis points versus prior year, but up 70 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, volume and price increased operating income, but the price increases were not enough to fully recover raw material cost increases, particularly in Europe. Versus prior quarter, positive volume combined with better operating and distribution cost performance drove the margin expansion.  Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 8. In U.S./Canada, sales improved 8% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5% with particular strength in both argon and hydrogen. Pricing was 3% positive with improvement across the product lines as we took actions to recover higher costs. LOX/LIN capacity utilization improved to the mid-70s. Consistent with our plans, contract signings were very strong again this quarter above the good Q3 results. This will translate into positive volume momentum through next year. In Europe, sales increased 8% versus last year all due to currency. Volumes were relatively flat across the businesses, pricing was positive in liquid/bulk and packaged gases, but offset by continued negative price pressure in healthcare. The positive liquid/bulk price was an improvement over last quarter but still do not fully recover cost increases. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 80s. In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year with underlying sales up 23% and a 7% positive impact from currency. Volumes were up 20% with growth across the product lines, LOX/LIN volumes were up 22% in China. Pricing continued to be strong, up 3% with the LOX/LIN prices up 5%. Plant loadings are around 80% as we continue to add capacity and sales to the system. Signings for the quarter were well above last year.  This quarter, we continue to demonstrate our focus on, and success, in emerging markets. In August, we announced a new contract to supply our fully integrated Oxy fuel combustion solution to Guangzhou Chung Sung century Fiber Glass in Nansha, China to reduce emissions and improve productivity in glass filament production. We will supply our clean fire oxy fuel burners and flow control skid and we will install a prism BSA unit for on-site oxygen generation. Last month, we announced an agreement to acquire a 25% stake in the gases and equipment businesses of Abdula Hashin Industrial Gases and Equipment Co., the largest industrial gas company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We are excited about using our successful joint venture strategy in the Middle East. This strategy of combing our partners' local market and country knowledge with our skills and engineering, operations, applications and finance, has led to our leadership positions in Taiwan, Korea, Spain and other countries. Deepening our relationship with AHG gives us the opportunity to participate in the strong Merchant Gases growth in Saudi Arabia and is a significant new platform from which to pursue Tonnage Gas opportunities throughout the Middle East.  Please turn to Slide 9, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $883 million increased 17% versus last year with volumes up 11%, energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 3% and a positive 3% currency affect. Sequentially, sales were up 2% on 3% higher volumes and 1% lower energy and raw material pass-through. The volume increase is relative to both prior year and prior quarter, were primarily driven by new projects. Operating income of $152 million was up 30% from prior year and 32% sequentially on higher volumes, improved operating efficiency and reduced maintenance costs. We also had a net gain from contract modifications of a about $0.05 in the quarter. As expected, after a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, Q4 maintenance spending was lower. Operating margin of 17.2% increased to 160 basis points versus prior year and 400 basis points sequentially on the higher operating income.  Moving to new business. We were pleased to announce the long-term hydrogen supply agreement for Shell Oil's Deer Park, Texas refinery and for Motiva Enterprise's Convent, Louisiana refinery. Both contracts will be supported by Air Products' industry-leading Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline supply network that will serve multiple refinery and petrochemical companies from New Orleans on the east to the Houston ship channel on the West. We also, on our third long-term contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to Wison and Clean Energy Limited's coal classification facility in Nanjing, China. We will build, own and operate our third air separation unit and integrate a liquefier to supply Wison and produce liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon for the growing regional Merchant industrial gas market. These awards are concrete examples of the key market growth drivers we shared at our Investor Conference in June.  Please turn to Slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $587 million were up 12% compared to last year on 5% higher volumes, 4% higher pricing and 3% currency. Sequentially, sales were down 3% on lower volumes. Electronics sales were up 17% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially as industry growth slowed as we expected. Electronic materials sales were up modestly versus last year, while Tonnage and equipment continued to show strong growth. Electronics specialty materials pricing remained stable. Performance material sales increased 7% versus last year with 9% higher prices and a 3% positive currency affect, offsetting a 5% volume decline. Sequentially, sales were down 9% primarily on the volume declines. The softness in PMD reflects slowdowns in key markets, including housing, construction and autos. Operating income of $92 million was up 9% versus prior year, primarily due to Electronics volumes and Performance Materials pricing and was down 16% sequentially due to lower Performance Materials volumes. Segment operating margin of 15.6% was down 50 basis points versus prior year due to higher costs, down 250 basis points sequentially due to lower volumes and higher costs. Margins exceeded the FY '11 target of 15% by 80 basis points for the year. In new projects, we announced the new nitrogen plant at our site in the Chonan Industrial Complex in Korea and a second contract with Samsung mobile display to supply gaseous nitrogen and oxygen and liquid argon for their active matrix organic light-emitting diode production in Tanjeong, Korea.  Finally, earlier this quarter, we announced plans to more than double our nitrogen trifluoride or NF3 capacity at our Ulsan, Korea site. NF3 remains the chamber cleaning gas of choice for semiconductor display and photovoltaic manufacturers. This plan will leverage our existing site infrastructure to expand our reliable and cost-effective NF3 supply.  Now please turn to Slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $96 million were down 25% versus prior year on lower ASU and LNG sales and up 21% sequentially on higher ASU sales. Operating income of $12 million was down 43% versus prior year due to lower sales and up 34% sequentially due primarily to favorable year-end cost absorption. Our backlog is up versus prior year and sequentially on several new large ASU orders.  Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks, Simon. Now if you'll turn to Slide #12, I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. After a fairly good start during the first half of fiscal 2011, we saw economic growth decline as uncertainty grew. Because of this uncertainty, our fiscal 2012 forecast for economic growth has a wider range than in past years. Globally, for the regions we operate in, we see economic growth of 2% to 5%. On the pessimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: for the U.S., if the current fiscal and policy uncertainties continue, this would likely keep consumer confidence low; automobile production slow; housing at its current low level and the investment climate depressed, resulting in about 1% manufacturing growth. Asia would see the contraction of consumer markets in the U.S. and Europe and we would not expect Chinese consumer spending to significantly offset this. Investment activity would be held down by overcapacity concerns and we would expect regional growth to drop to 4%. For Europe, while we are not forecasting a full-fledged financial crisis, we are forecasting that current negative trends continue and the region would have a modest manufacturing recession with an expected 2% contraction.  On the optimistic side of this range, we would see the following scenarios: in the U.S., we would start to see a consensus form in advance of the election, which leads to improved consumer confidence and business investment, starting a virtuous cycle of growth in the second half of our fiscal year; we would expect 5% economic growth; in Asia, the attempts to drive greater consumer spending in China would succeeded and demand would grow across the region, along with better export markets to the U.S. and Europe; expected growth would rise to 9%; in Europe, the negative trends would start to reverse as the governments made progress on their fiscal problems, however, expected growth would still be weak at 1%. This broad range of economic scenarios results in a wider range for earnings of $5.90 to $6.30 per share for 2012. While the outcomes could vary, we are prepared to execute our business plans and adapt to whatever economic environment emerges.  Walking from our 2011 earnings per share of $5.73, we have the following factors. New plant on-streams in 2011 and 2012 should add $0.30 to $0.35. These are projects that are either onstream now, or will be on stream soon and our backed by contract contractual commitments to buy. We should see this growth independent of global economic conditions. Loading existing assets should add $0.10 to $0.40 to earnings per share. This is the factor most influenced by the economy. In Equipment and Energy, we expect fiscal 2012 operating results will be down due to less LNG activity, a $0.05 to $0.10 headwind. Pension expense will be about a $0.05 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from 2010 to 2011 and lower asset returns. And we see a $0.10 headwind from a higher tax rate, approximately 26%. In any economic environment, cost control and cost reductions are important factors that drive earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2012, our bottom line should also improve from our productivity efforts and we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing.  Now, turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, we are continuing to add selling resources in the U.S. to drive volume growth as we focus on new applications and expand our micro bulk offering. We continue to expand our Merchant capacity in Asia, manufacturing growth along with our new applications efforts should lead to strong volume growth. In Europe, we will continue to derive prices higher to offset higher energy costs and take actions to reduce operating costs. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal 2011 startups along with a number of investments due to come onstream this year. A list of our major projects is in the appendix slide.  On the new order front, we have announced and expect to continue to announce, a significant number of new projects, which will provide growth in 2013 and beyond. For Electronics, we are forecasting modest silicon growth of 0% to 5% for 2012. We expect that our position with the industry leaders should help us grow faster than the industry as they are making the majority of new capital investments. Electronics industry capital expenditures after 2 very strong years, is forecasted to decline 15% to 20% in 2012. Our Electronics Equipment business results are expected to slow accordingly. However, this would still make 2012 the second highest capital spending year for the industry. For Performance Materials, we expect the current volume softness to continue through Q1. But when economic conditions improve, volume growth should return, as we benefit from our low-cost production facilities and our new product, market and application successes.  Before we turn to the next quarter, I want to briefly address a question we have heard. What if 2012 turns into a re-run of 2009 and the world goes back into a recession? First, we believe the world is different from both an economic and an Air Product standpoint. With regard to the economy, autos and housing, which were hit hard, have not fully recovered. Therefore, they have less relative exposure. Electronics had a massive inventory correction, but today, inventories are at a much lower level. And both corporations and consumers have delevered their balance sheets and are financially stronger. With regard to Air Products, we're also much stronger, our margins are 200 basis points higher than in 2008 and our Tonnage segment in 2009, we experienced a significant drop in the value of our operating efficiencies due to the large drop in natural gas prices. With already low natural gas prices, our operating results should be more stable. And Electronics has restructured its business, strengthened its position with the industry leaders, improved its product portfolio and increased segment margins by over 450 basis points. So if we do go into a global recession, we don't see 2012 being as bad as 2009.  Turning to Slide #13. Our guidance for quarter 1 is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.39 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from new plant onstreams, including our new hydrogen plant in Rotterdam and the Weihe oxygen on-site and Merchant plant. Offsetting this sequential improvement, in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect flat economic growth along with the lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, profits are expected to decline due to higher maintenance spending, financial difficulties with a particular customer in our polyurethane intermediates business and the quarter 4 contract modifications. So we expect our quarter 1 operating profit level in the Tonnage segment to be similar to the level delivered in quarter 1 last year.  Consistent with the full year guidance, we will see lower Equipment and Energy profits. Equity affiliates, pension and currency will be negative, but they will be roughly offset by lower non-controlling interest on lower taxes. As I said, we believe there is a chance that Europe goes into a recession and at best, we'll have flat to very slight growth. Therefore, regardless of the economy during Q1, we will begin to take actions to reduce our costs across the region. These actions are not yet fully defined and any cost or benefits from these actions are not included in our guidance.  Please turn to Slide #14 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2011 was $1.6 billion. For 2012, we expect that our capital spending will be between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, an increase of 20% to 40%. This includes a maintenance capital expenditure of $300 million to $350 million, in line with prior year. The majority of our spending is in the Tonnage area with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all 4 business segments, over 75% of our growth capital expenditures is under long-term take or pay contracts. You can also see that the majority of our spending is in the Americas and Asia. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plans from customers and we also continue to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions, such as our investment in Saudi Arabia.  Now, let me wrap up. We had a good 2011, growing sales and earnings double digits while continuing to make improvements in our operating margin and most importantly, our return on capital. The increase in capital spending we announced today, plus the bidding activity we are seeing, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2012. As we move forward, our priority is to deliver the growth, margin improvement and higher returns that'll make us the best investment choice in the industry for our shareholders. 2012 will certainly offer its challenges as we work through the economic uncertainties. However, we believe we are well positioned to make the progress we need to deliver our 2015 goals.  Thank you and now, I'll turn the call over to David to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just quickly, I wanted to talk about the Saudi Arabia opportunity. How big can this investment become given the install base of petrochemicals in that country and sort of the future growth with projects like Dow's Saudi Arabia [ph] project?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And P.J., you're right. In Saudi and the Middle East in general, offers a very big opportunity for us. Our investment on AHG is to get us a foothold and an operating base within the country, which we think is very important. From there, we think of many of the opportunities for this growth come on the on-site area for very large plants. And we see this going out. And so we could have, in the future, billions of dollars invested in the Middle East. It will be primarily as we look forward a market, which is built on on-sites, yes, you're right.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just quickly on Electronics. You talked about the slowdown there in core Electronics business. Can you tell us what's happening with semiconductor fabs in Taiwan and if that slowdown that you talked about continue in 4Q? And then just remind us your exposure on LCDs?
Paul E. Huck: And Simon?
Simon R. Moore: Yes. Thanks, Paul. Thanks, P.J., good question. So obviously, as we talked about last quarter, we had seen some slowing in certain segments in the Electronics market. I think that has continued and we see that being fairly flat going through the first half of next year with an expected pick up in the second half of the year. But as Paul mentioned, we see MSI for the year, in a range of 0% to 5%. I would just also make the point though, that while that's fairly modest growth, we saw sequential sales in Electronics up 2% and we see the number of our customers make comments this week that certainly would clarify that we're in no danger of seeing any significant downturn like we have seen in the past. I mean, Intel talked about inventories being tightly managed and obviously, Apple reported very strong sequential sales increases in their units. So again, I think we see flat but no sign of any significant downturn.
Operator: And next we'll go to Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It looks like your Merchant gas profitability still hasn't recovered in that your revenues in the quarter are lower than they were in the first quarter when you weren't roughly $200 million. So what's delaying the recovery of the margin, recovery of that business? And how do you see that next year in terms of being able to throw off the factors that are depressing your profitability?
Paul E. Huck: Okay, Jeff, and that's a good question and I'll update everybody on our progress on -- in the margins in the Merchant area. Because we did make progress this quarter. And we outlined a number of actions last quarter in which we said we're going to take. The first of those actions was within the U.S. to improve our volumes there. We made good progress. We had 5% growth in volumes. We are working to get that better obviously. I think the good news, which Simon reported is quarter 4 was that the signings were up from quarter 3 and when we just compare our signings for the second half, when our actions and post-Airgas started to take some effect to the first half, our signings our 2x in the second half what they were in the first half. So we're still hiring salespeople. That effort, I believe, is on track and will accomplish the goals, which we have. As we said it's going to take some time for us to see this. It will take probably through the next year as we see these customers brought on stream, because it takes 6 to 9 months to marry a customer on stream. With regard to Europe and the prices which we talked about, the Europe pricing as you heard was flat, that was healthcare being down. Improved pricing in Europe on the liquid/bulk side. However, we're not recovering the increased power there and we need to do that. So we did more actions on pricing and we need to be better there. So I'd like the trend of pricing starting to move up but it's not fixed yet and we need to get more things going there. Operational issues, which we had. We had less this quarter. So we are improving in those things. You can see that in the cost performance. We still have some other things, which we've got to do to bring plants onstream to end the distribution cost. We talked about the LaPorte plant and the Riley Ridge helium plant, which help in our supply of argon and helium, which will lower our distribution costs in those areas. And they come onstream in quarter 1 of this year and we'll likely -- we'll see the effect in quarter 2. Helium supply is still short and the Riley Ridge plant will help us there to come on stream. So overall, we think that we like the improvement. But we still think that there is more. Prior year was higher, but we intend to go there. So first quarter, we're not going to have everything in. There is a seasonal volume decline, so it's going probably tough, but we look towards the second, third and fourth quarters for that getting a lot better.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Thank you for that. And for my follow-up, your equity income was $55 million in the fourth quarter and normally, you report about $35 million in equity income. So you are up $20 million. So is that a one-time item? And I suppose if it's not a one-time item, do you expect to grow off that number in 2012, or what's the normalized level of your equity income given this sharp increase in the quarter?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, Jeff. And the thing, which I talked about was that on the equity income was that we did have a one-time item of about $0.04 a share. So if you take that and that number out, the $0.04, about $10 million to $12 million or so. If you take that out, then you go to the performance for this quarter. Realize that all of this is income which comes from overseas, principally. And so a lot of it is subject to the fluctuations on currency also. So giving a normalized level is tough when the currency fluctuate about a lot. But otherwise, the one-time items, take that out, and you got a good level there.
Operator: And next we'll go to John McNulty with Crédit Suisse.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just 2 quick questions. Paul, when I look at the upper end of what you're guiding to and some of the assumptions, so global manufacturing up 5% with the U.S. up 5% and Asia up 9%. They seem like pretty decent kind of outlooks and yet you're calling for about 10% EPS growth, which is kind, which is below your long-term target of what looks to be 15% to 16% to get to that 2015 goal. So I guess, I'm wondering why isn't -- why wouldn't the EPS be higher if you kind of hit this high-end of the range in terms of global manufacturing growth? And how should we think about that growth, maybe, potentially accelerating in the out years for you to hit your target?
Paul E. Huck: And John, I think a couple of things in which people should understand about the guidance here is that a lot of the pickup, which we talked about, occurs in the second half of the year. So we see regardless of the economic scenario, a slow first half. The other aspect of these things is that we do tend to lag a little bit, a quarter or 2 in a number of areas in responding to what happens in the economy with things. And so, I could see a delay where the economies pickup, but we don't follow directly in that particular quarter. And so that is really what happens, which would then say, that yes, 2013 growth would be stronger than what you would expect to see from the economy.
John P. McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then just a question on your Electronics. You had relatively decent pricing this year and in the past, that was never the case. What's your pricing outlook for 2012? Can we see further price increases or was this kind of a one-time ratchet up and we kind of stay level from this point forward?
Paul E. Huck: And the goal of Electronics here, as we said, are the key prices flat to up for us going forward. So we think that, and that we can continue the price improvement here. If you broke the 2 businesses apart, the price performance in Performance Materials was better than price performance in Electronics for the year on that. But Electronics previously had been one which had been declining, and so over the past 2 years, and we have seen our price performance be a lot better.
Operator: And next we'll go to Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A question on Tonnage. You mentioned that you had about $0.05 of gains there related to some contract modifications. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what was modified? Whether it was in Tonnage per se or, Paul, the polyurethane intermediates, what the nature of the modifications might have been? And whether we should consider those modifications to be a source of durable gains or is it more transitory in nature?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And Kevin, and it was contract mods in the on-site area, not in the polyurethane business. So it gets around as we have events, as we change contracts, as we move volume around and commitments of volume around. As we roll contracts, very often we have events which lead to an accounting gain or loss on those things. And typically those things are not all that large. In this quarter, we had a couple of them, which when you combine them, and they made to a large gain for us in this quarter. So we decided to guide you because it doesn't repeat. But we do have sources of gains and losses, which put a little noise and the Tonnage business just get's it, it is the nature of the business, but normally it's not big enough to spike out or to see.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up Paul, in Merchant, what was the magnitude of the pressure that you saw in healthcare-related pricing and on the positive side? It sounded like LOX/LIN would would've been up regionally in Europe, and maybe you could size that for us?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And LOX/LIN pricing was up, I'm recalling now, I think LOX/LIN was about 3% for that. The healthcare pricing, I remember it by, and by the individual contracts, but I would say it's probably about 4% to 5%.
Operator: Next we'll go to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Paul, just on the backlog, given a large number of projects coming on in 2012, will the $2.5 billion backlog be up or down by year end 2012 versus 2011?
Paul E. Huck: And that depends upon the award activity. But for right now, the way in which we see the world panning out and the way in which we see these bids happening, we would expect our backlog to be up.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just given the 30-ish, $0.40 of earnings growth in '12 versus '11, would that be the same amount in '13 versus '12? Given based on what we have in the backlog today would be up or down or lower?
Paul E. Huck: It would probably close to the same. It could increase as we get some smaller projects on, so we still need the ability to raise that a little bit. But I'd say it'd be about the same.
Operator: Next we have Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First an observation, it seems like you guys get picked on quite a bit for your Electronics exposure. But it seemed like in the quarter at least, Electronics held pretty well and it was the Performance Materials side that had the challenges. Just wondering in those end markets, you called out housing and construction and autos, can you give us a little more feel for what's going on a specifically? I would have thought autos was improving as Japan came back globally, auto rates improving. And then I thought housing and construction was already pretty coarse. So is there something specific to your business or your product lines that might be different than the macros there?
Paul E. Huck: And Bob, I think, another thing, which I think factored in the business is we have seen a lot of concern from the people who bought from us and the customer base that they don't want to build inventory. And so people are paying a lot of attention to that, because they're concerned about the economy going forward and therefore, what they did during this quarter is a they took the inventories down for their products. So I don't think it's so much related exactly to production. But people are concerned going forward about producing too much and being called inventory. So we did see that occur over the summer.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And Paul, I know you don't see this as a prelude to the economic environment of '09, but I mean, clearly, to get to your '15 targets, you need a pretty massive acceleration after a slower year end 2012. So would you expect to defer those 2015 targets or do you think there's still a reasonable chance you could achieve those?
Paul E. Huck: No. We do not think -- no, and we're not going to defer them and we still think there is a good chance for us to get there. We are still very pleased with the markets and the opportunities, which we see for investment which drive this. So I think we're on track as you see in the capital spending area for growing our capital expenditures and what that means is that there's growth, which sits behind there in the 2013, '14 and '15.
Operator: All right. And next we have Dan Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Paul, question on just your guidance outlook, it does seem somewhat conservative. The midpoint is about 8% or actually 6.5% on a reported basis. Is part of that conservatism due to the fact that you've kind of have a number of one-time items? It seems in this quarter alone you had about $0.09 of one-time items.
Paul E. Huck: Well, I think, and the concern, which we have, Don, is with the economy. As I've talked about it. And does the economy picked up in the second half of the 2012 or not from where we see it today. You can see the quarter 1 guidance for us is low, and we're not happy, but we think it reflects the reality of what we're seeing in the economy out there. I don't think it reflects the noise from one-time items.
Simon R. Moore: And maybe just, also -- Don, sorry, this is Simon, too, you mentioned $0.09 as a one-time items. I mean, I think maybe just for a second, we did talk about the $0.05 in the Tonnage contract roll and while there were some items in the equity affiliates, they were kind of offset by the minority interest line as well. So those kind of sets, so we would have said it's more like a $0.05 one time.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Maybe just to follow up on the Tonnage, but back out that $0.05, I guess it's about $14 million to get you to about 15.6%, which is still well below your 2015 target of 17% to 20%. And given that you have such a high proportion of hydrogen, where at $4 or $5 natural gas it's hard above sort of 14% to 15% margins. What drives that big margin improvement in Tonnage? Are you going to get more aggressive, say, on financial engineering and perhaps not taking title of the gas so that you get the benefit of not passing through that cost component?
Paul E. Huck: We're not going to try to do it by trying to wave our hands or trying to engineer this from a financial standpoint. The way in which we're going to do this is we have a backlog in China, which we talked about in the gasification end. We have more projects to announce there and those projects are oxygen and the margins and the returns on them are very good and they will help drive that margin up higher. Because there are going to rep a lot of investments for us going forward here. And you can see the Asia portion of our capital expenditures has picked up, and we expect that to continue to grow.
Operator: And next we have a Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: I was -- first of all, hoping as we're talking about these sort of one-time items. Can you just segregate what's in the negative $22 million number in the corporate operating income number?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, Mike. And so -- and there's a slide in the backup for that. You'll see the big number, which is included there is an inventory number, which and so I'll explain what happened to this. In total, the inventory number, which affected the corporation in total is about $2 million unfavorable. What happens is, at year end, is we do 2 things. First, within the books we use a standard cost in our P&Ls and so what that means if you go back to accounting courses, you take the inventory out its standard and you put the inventory in its standard and that goes into the COGS and the purchase price variances flow through the P&L. At the end of the year, we do our inventory on the balance sheet and they get they get valued at current cost for those things. And so there is a write up or a write down of inventories, which occurs within the business segments. In the U.S. only then, we also adjust to LIFO, which occurs at the corporate level in total on that thing. So it's a gain or loss, and which gets impacted there. So the $19 million or so on inventory, I believe, is all relates to those 2 adjustments on net for the company, is $2 million unfavorable.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: All right and just looking at demand trends overall in key end markets, can you talk a little bit about areas that you watch as leading indicators and it sounds like there is sort of indicating to you that things are softening and that there are areas of concern. I don't think you would guide to a number like you've guided just based on what you're reading in the headlines and what the are seeing.
Paul E. Huck: We watched the statistics and we watched the trends on a sequential basis. And so, we do have -- and real concerns as we talked about, from an economy standpoint about the amount of uncertainty, which holds back on the invest in business, holds about people creating jobs, which you need to create jobs to get consumer confidence to get consumers to buy. And so as we look at it, the economy is a just kind of limping along globally to a very large extent in many instances. And what we're looking for really is some signs of some of these issues, which hang over everybody around the uncertainty to get the economy to start to move again. But the developed world is in tough shape from an economic standpoint right now. Corporations are doing well, and we're doing well on a financial standpoint. But volumes -- and the volume growth is just not there in many instances, and we're concerned about that.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division: All right. And lastly, I was hoping to maybe just get some more details on the Merchant business. You kind of referenced expecting to see some improvement in LAR in some of the dislocation issues you've been seeing related to LaPorte, Texas, as well as the new helium project that's coming onstream. Just maybe a little better sense of kind of a supply-demand dynamics on LAR and helium?
Simon R. Moore: Good question. As Paul said, both those projects are coming on in the next quarter. So when they come on, that'll loosen things up a little bit. We have talked in the past about helium being tight globally, longer term than that. So they will help but they will not solve the problem.
Operator: And next we'll go to Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: In terms of the $0.30, $0.35 of new plant earnings of this year in '12, is that fairly even throughout the year or is it maybe a little bit front-end loaded, back-end loaded?
Paul E. Huck: I think it is pretty even. When I look at this overall, Mike, I think we have plans coming on throughout the year.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then one quick follow-up on Merchant. What type of incremental leverage do you expect to get back to and will we see that at some point in 2012?
Paul E. Huck: You will start to see the operating leverage from North America probably in late Q1 and Q2, Q3 and Q4 with the signings that we have. I just go by the rules of thumb which we have, so I would expect to see that happening. As far as the operating leverage is concerned, we have the ability probably to sell another $150 million or so within the U.S. just based upon the leverage, which exists today and before we got to a sold-out condition. So it's a pretty nice -- a nice margin comes with that.
Operator: And next we have David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: First off, what are the top and bottom line impacts from currency that you're assuming in your fiscal year '12 guidance? And also do you just assume constant natural gas prices in your forecast?
Paul E. Huck: Yes. And what we do is we pick a gas forecast out there so the forecast for gas is pretty consistent to what we saw in 2011 was a little over $4 or so. If I look at the guidance here, we actually have in our guidance, the dollar strengthening against the euro overall from that and some deterioration against the RMB.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then second question sort of economic macro. What odds would you place on a mild economic recession or global recession in the coming year? And you've mentioned a couple of times that you sort of expect acceleration in the back half of the year and I'm wondering as your comments earlier, sound like pretty uncertain, what gives you confidence that we will see that?
Paul E. Huck: Okay. First, I do not see a global recession occurring. So the odds that I place on it would be low from my standpoint. I do think the odds in Europe are higher, but not for a global one. If you then took a look at and said, the confidence on the second half of the year, I think what happens is hopefully, some of these uncertainties start to resolve. We gave the thing for the U.S. it is that within the U.S., we start to see a consensus emerge on things like tax reform, regulations, entitlements, spending and things like that. And people start to see a way forward where they can start to predict what impact is that going to have on the decision, which I mean -- we're talking to make to run my business. Once we see that, I think people will start to expand, invest, hire people and stuff like that. And once we get the politicians somewhat in line with these things and we get a path forward, I think it gets better for that. In Europe, I think as they continue to work through the current crisis which exists there, as they start to see and resolve those things in whatever way they go, whether they go worse or better on things as we work our through. We're going to get at some point to an end at that, and I think that probably occurs sometime within the next year or so.
Operator: And next we'll go to Mark Gulley with Ticonderoga.
Mark R. Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: Paul, I recognize just 4 months after your Investor Day in New York, you start to change the goal. Well I'll check some math with you. If I take the fiscal '12 guidance in order to get to the $10 earnings share number, you sort of implied back in June, you'd have to grow earnings 18% per year for years, the last 4 years in that period. Is that about right and is that what you're sort of telling us today?
Paul E. Huck: Yes, yes.
Mark R. Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe a little bit of detail on the tax rate. Why is it accelerating a little bit in fiscal '12?
Paul E. Huck: And the reason for us taking up tax rate is we continue to see pressure in the government to close things down to make things harder, to take advantage of credits and other things, which we have. So we think there is upward pressure on taxes going forward.
Paul E. Huck: Okay. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. The whole Air Products team is excited by the opportunities which we face, and are committed to take the actions to improve our performance in 2012 and beyond. Hope every one has a good weekend.
Operator: And that does conclude today's conference, and we thank you for participating.

Simon Moore: Thank you, Augusta. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our Q3 results and outlook for the remainder of 2011. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, are also available on the website.  Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations.  Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.  Please turn to Slide #3. For the quarter, sales of $2.6 billion were up 14% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 7% on 6% higher volumes, primarily in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments and 1% higher pricing. Favorable currency translation contributed 5%. Sequentially, sales were 3% higher, mainly due to currency. And while we did see sequential volume growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments, Merchant Gases volumes were flat sequentially and Equipment sales declined. Operating income of $417 million increased 11% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes. Our operating margin of 16.2% declined 40 basis points versus prior year and 80 basis points sequentially, due to higher operating costs in our Merchant segment and planned maintenance costs in our Tonnage segment.  For the quarter, net income from containing operations increased 15% and diluted earnings per share increased 14%, each, versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13%, up 30 basis points. The 16.2% operating margin for this quarter is a disappointment for us. The shortfall to our goal is primarily in the Merchant segment due to 4 factors: a lack of volume growth in North -- in the North American business where we have significant available capacity, further declines in our European business, continued operating problems that resulted in higher operating and dislocation costs and tight helium supply with increased procurement costs.  To remedy these issues, we are taking the following actions. In North America, we are continuing to add sales resources focused around our plants and on the end markets where we have strong offerings. For example, oil field services and electronics packaging. We've already seen signings in the third quarter improved, and we expect continued improvement. It does take about 6 to 9 months for new signings to come on line. We will also continue to drive price improvement. In Europe, we continue to face a slow recovery, along with the pricing environment that is under recovering our variable cost increases. To address this, we had raised prices for a number of products and in a number of countries, and we'll have more price increases this quarter to stop price and variable margin erosion. We will strongly defend our volumes from competitive attack. However, there are certain accounts we will either improve or shed. We are focusing our sales efforts on customers close to our plants to lower our distribution costs and to leverage our application strength in areas like cement and combustion. For our operating performance, we are working hard across our system to increase plant availability and reduce unplanned outages. An example is argon production, where product has been tight and operating and distribution costs have been high. Tonnage expansion is currently underway, such as the new LaPorte plant scheduled to come onstream later this year, will enhance our argon availability. Regarding helium, we have and we'll be raising prices further, and we will be bringing on additional capacity later this year. Overall, we are forecasting Merchant margins to improve next quarter, and we now expect to meet our 20% margin goal in fiscal 2012, on our way to our 21% to 24% goal for 2015.  While Merchant margins disappointed, the Electronics and Performance Materials segment exceeded their 15% goal, posting a year-to-date margin of 15.8% and 18.1% for this quarter. This performance has offset some of the Merchant shortfall. While this quarter just made it harder on ourselves, we are still committed to achieving our 17% goal for the year. Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 14% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes increased earnings per share by $0.14 year-on-year. Pricing, combined with the impact of energy and raw materials, subtracted $0.02. Costs were $0.06 unfavorable, as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our Merchant segment. Equity affiliate income was broadly higher across our Merchant, Tonnage and Electronics segments contributing $0.03. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.09 favorable impact.  Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 12% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 4% on 3% higher volumes, primarily in Asia and positive pricing in North America and Asia. Currency increased sales by 8%. Sequentially, sales were up 1%, with underlying sales flat and a 1% increase due to currency. Merchant Gases' operating income of $182 million was up 3% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially.  Segment operating margin of 17.7% was down 160 basis points versus prior year and down 60 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, plant operating issues increased maintenance and distribution costs. These challenges resulted in higher dislocation costs to keep our customers supplied.  In addition, our price increase efforts in Europe did not fully recover increased cost. Versus prior quarter, fixed and variable cost increases drove the margin decline. As Paul said, we expect margins to improve from these levels in Q4 and beyond.  Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In North America, sales improved 3% versus prior year. Volumes were flat with modest liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon growth offset by helium supply constraints limiting sales. Pricing was 3% positive, with improvement across the product lines. LOX/LIN plant loadings were in the low 70s. Signings were very strong this quarter, which will improve loadings as these new contracts take effect.  In Europe, sales increased 14% versus last year, with underlying sales up 1% and a positive 13% currency impact. Volumes were up 2% with modest growth across the product lines. Pricing remained a challenge, down 1% due to competitive pressure in both healthcare and liquid bulk. LOX/LIN plant loadings are in the mid-80s. In Asia, sales were up 22% versus last year, with underlying sales up 15%. As expected, growth rates have moderated somewhat from previous quarters as we have moved to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Overall volume growth remained strong. Volumes were up 12% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen up 13% across the region and up 19% in China. Pricing continued to be strong, up 3% with liquid oxygen and nitrogen prices up modestly. Argon pricing was strong versus last year, but as expected, we did see lower sequential argon pricing due to less spot sales in China with a more balanced supply-and-demand market. Plant loadings remained in the mid-80s. We did bring onstream our new merchant capacity at Xingtai Steel in China integrated with our Tonnage oxygen plant.  Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $869 million increased 20% versus last year, with volumes up 11% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 7%. The volume increase was driven by both new projects and improved loadings. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on a 5% volume increase and 3% higher energy and raw material pass-through. New plant volume growth and less volume impact for maintenance outages drove the increase.  Operating income of $115 million was down 4% from prior year on a higher maintenance cost, primarily from customer-scheduled outages, and down 5% sequentially, due to lower annual operating bonuses. After a number of scheduled maintenance outages in Q2 and Q3, we expect Q4 maintenance spending to be lower. Operating margin of 13.2% decreased 330 basis points versus prior year. About 2/3 of this decline is due to the maintenance cost just mentioned, the remainder is due to higher natural gas cost pass-through. Moving to new business. We were pleased to announce a significant increase in our hydrogen supply to Valero's 2 Gulf Coast refineries. This award of over 200 million standard cubic feet a day for Valero in Port Arthur, Texas and St. Charles, Louisiana was facilitated by our Gulf Coast pipeline project and expands our leading global hydrogen position. We expect to announce additional hydrogen and oxygen awards in Q4.  Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. We were very pleased with this quarter's performance as sales, income and margin were all the highest in the history of the segment. Segment sales of $602 million were up 21% compared to last year, on 14% higher volumes, 3% positive pricing and 4% currency. Sequentially, sales were up 5% on 3% higher volumes and 1% higher prices.  Electronic sales were up 24% compared to last year and up 3% sequentially, as the industry maintained high utilization rates. Electronic Specialty Materials sales increased 14% versus prior year and 6% sequentially. Tonnage sales were up 12% versus prior year and 4% sequentially, and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially. Electronic Specialty Materials pricing was flat versus last year and last quarter. As we communicated at the Investor Conference, we continue to see more stable pricing. In fact, NF3 prices were up slightly both versus last year and sequentially. This positive impact was offset by lower new product pricing, resulting from higher new product volumes based on previously negotiated price volume discounts. This is good news as customers move our profitable new products into full production. Performance Materials sales increased 18% versus last year, with volumes up 7%, pricing up 7% and currency contributing 4%. We continue to recover increased raw material costs with our pricing actions. Sequentially, sales rose 6% on 3% volume growth and 2% price.  Operating income of $109 million was up 75% versus prior year, primarily due to volume leverage and continued positive cost performance. Income was up 19% sequentially, primarily due to volume leverage. Segment operating margin of 18.1% improved 550 basis points from last year and 220 basis points sequentially, due to strong volume and cost performance. As expected, we did not see any material impact to our business from the tragic events in Japan.  There have been some signs of softening in certain electronic sectors, including foundry and LCD. However, you probably saw the very strong results from Apple and Intel exceeding expectations in results reported this week. As we have said, we believe our strong position with the industry leaders and our new product success will mitigate any effect, and we expect continued strong performance from this segment.  In terms of new projects, last month, we announced the successful startup of our new Electronic Materials facility in Banwol, Korea. This facility will produce products enabling our customers to create advanced generation devices and reinforces our leadership position in the electronics market. During the quarter, we announced plans to increase production of ultrahigh purity nitrogen and oxygen and expand the nitrogen pipeline at our Chandler, Arizona facility. We have successfully served semiconductor manufacturers in the Chandler market for over 30 years. Finally, earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our nitrogen capacity and pipeline network at the Gumi National Industrial Complex in Korea. We currently supply nearly 20 semiconductor and photovoltaic customers via our pipeline network. This expansion will support existing customer growth and new customers. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $80 million were down 31% versus prior year on lower ASU sales and 30% sequentially on lower ASU and LNG sales. Operating income of $9 million was down 59% versus prior year, due to lower sales and a prior year asset gain, and 62% sequentially, due to lower sales. Our backlog is down versus prior year, but as expected, showed a 34% increase sequentially, primarily driven by our new LNG technology and equipment order for the world's first floating LNG facility at Shell's Australia Prelude Project. We leveraged our innovative capabilities and years of LNG experience to meet the unique demands of a successful floating LNG facility, and we feel we are well positioned to benefit from what could be a major LNG trend. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thank you, Simon. Now if you will turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook.  First, let's take a look at the current economic environment. This quarter, our underlying revenue growth rate declined from 12% in the first half to 7%. This is partially due to the slowing of manufacturing growth rates across all regions. Many manufacturing markets slowed as a result of spikes in commodity price inflation, high inventory levels, uncertainty over government policies and fiscal situations and weak private sector confidence. As uncertainty surrounding policy, fiscal and sovereign debt issues begin to resolve over the coming months, we would expect growth to pick up early in our fiscal 2012.  Our guidance for quarter 4 is for earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.53, year-over-year growth of 10% to 13%. This is based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. The manufacturing economy globally should continue its gradual recovery. This, along with some seasonal boost, should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases. And in Tonnage Gases, operating income should improve significantly, on higher volumes and lower planned maintenance spending.  Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be a higher fiscal quarter 4 tax rate. Our tax rate in quarter 4 should be about 26%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%. For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year have not changed significantly. Our capital expenditure guidance is now $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for 2011, at the top end of the original $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion range. Our full year fiscal '11 earnings per share guidance range is now $5.70 to $5.75, 14% to 15% growth over last year. While it is still early, as we look to fiscal 2012, we expect our capital spending will increase by 20% to 30% next year. We'll provide more specific guidance on next quarter's call.  Now let me wrap up. Please turn to Slide 11. Last month, many of you joined us at our Investor Conference where we shared our 2015 revenue growth and margin and returning goal, along with the actions and plans we have to achieve them. All of us are excited by the growth and improvement opportunities these goals represent. We believe the market positions we have built, the customer relationships and product offerings we have cultivated and the actions we are taking to drive out costs will make us the best investment in our industry for our shareholders.  Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Augusta to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John McNulty of Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Just 2 questions. The first one on the European pricing issues. You made a relatively strong statement that you're being attacked by your competition there, and you weren't going to let go of volumes in that situation. Can you walk us through what's actually going on, and maybe what's changed to make it such an aggressive environment there?
Paul Huck: Yes, John, we have seen the pricing in Europe be more aggressive, particularly by some of our European competitors, as they have striven for volume. As you know, growth in Europe is not as strong as it is in other parts of the world. However, as we look at this, we were going to defend our -- we are going to defend our key accounts, and we are going to -- but we're also have a need to increase prices. And particularly in certain regions of Europe, particularly in the south, and we have started to put price increases out. The good news is that we've also seen -- we have seen our competitors start to follow those price increases. So we are encouraged. Its still early to tell, but pricing needs to get better in Europe.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. And then just a follow, also somewhat tied into the competitive environment. We were a little bit surprised to see, I guess, one of your competitors announced a pretty large project down in what's historically been kind of your territory in Louisiana with regard to hydrogen. And I guess I'm wondering how we should be thinking about the competitive environment along the Gulf Coast for hydrogen projects going forward.
Paul Huck: Well, the -- in a competitive environment, it is exactly that. We believe, as we look at this thing, as we look at this, is that with our connector project, which connects Louisiana and Texas pipeline systems, that we have the most reliable, the most efficient pipeline system in that area and that we should win the majority of projects there and maintain our position very well, with good pricing and good returns. We also won product at the same customer over which is -- was -- over which has occurred. Those things are going to happen. You're not going to win 100% of the business. But we still believe, as we said on our Investor Day, that we can maintain our share of the business here going forward.
Simon Moore: John, as we mentioned, too, we would be expecting to be able to announce some additional hydrogen orders in this next quarter as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Paul, you characterized the -- you said you can still meet 17% or at least that's your goal for the year still, after this 16% to this quarter that seems somewhat aggressive, especially with the Merchant outlook. So is that implying that this sort of new 18% Electronics margin level is sustainable? I mean, you talked about how some areas of Electronics are good but growth does seem to be slowing sequentially there. So maybe if you can just walk me through how you still expect to achieve 17% operating margins this year?
Paul Huck: Sure, Don. And one thing which we said is we just made it harder for ourselves. So we are going to have to have things go our way. But if we are going to make it, we're going to need improvement in the Merchant business itself in the fourth quarter. That means we're going to need for volumes to pick up here in the United States, in this quarter. We're going to have to see some of our pricing actions take effect in Europe. And most importantly, we're going to have to operate our plants well and remove some of these extra maintenance, operating and dislocation costs which we talked about. And that's -- and so that's how we get there, with a marked improvement in the Merchant margins. But it's hard, we're not going to get everything better all at once in that business very clearly. We didn't get there all in one quarter, we're not going to get out of it all in one quarter with these things.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: The follow-up on U.S. Merchant. Your operating rates seem unusually low, low 70s, and -- because typically, you don't get pricing until you get close to 80. I know you added some plants, and that's had an impact. But is there a need to restructure some of your U.S. Merchant plants here, and then maybe close down some plants in some regions to get higher operating rates and, hence, better pricing power?
Paul Huck: We do not believe so, Don, as we look at this. As we look at this, we look at the industry overall, and we think that given the demand structure, which is out there and the applications efforts, which we have going forward to be able to sell this product, and that we can get to a descent -- a better operating rate over time here, and that we would not take any product out at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
John Hirt: This is John Hirt standing in for P.J. this morning. I was wondering if you could break out the 10% year-over-year volume growth at the Tonnage business into new plant startups versus growth in your base book of business?
Paul Huck: Sure. Good question, John. It's split about evenly between new projects and loading up of existing assets.
John Hirt: Okay. And can you give us an update on how large your project backlog is at this point, following the recent contract signing with Valero?
Paul Huck: Sure. And we take a look at that at our backlog. Our backlog right now is in excess and well in excess of $2 billion. But as I've always said in this, you've got to be careful about just focusing on backlog number. The real good number for us here and that we are excited about is the growth in capital spending as we look to next year. We have previously been talking about a growth of 15% to 20% off of this year guidance range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Now it looks like we're coming in at the top -- towards the top end of that range, and we've taken our growth to be 20% to 30% for next year, which gives us a much better feel for -- and should give you a much better feel for what is happening because how long a project sits in backlog, it can always be there, so you're going to have something which you're billing over 3 or 4 years. It's always there. What you really want to see is the capital spending for the company growth and the CapEx. And so we don't have any real additional new support capital or replacement capital in there. That's still about $400 million a year on our guidance, but we've got very strong capital spending growth looking for next year.
Simon Moore: John,if I could just add also to it. As Paul mentioned that our backlog is up, but just -- because when you asked the question, you mentioned the Valero. Actually, in that backlog number, there is increased that Paul mentioned, there's no project for Valero yet. We have won the order with the customer, but with our pipeline network down there, we can continue to be flexible in terms of adding demand and supply. So we will build supply, but I just wanted to emphasize that in that number, there's no project for that large order yet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Paul, I guess I'm struck by the really strong volume, double-digit volumes in Tonnage, Electronics and Asian Merchant and how contradicted that is by no growth in North America. It seemed like in May and June, at least, the comments that you guys were a little bit more constructive in North America. So did we just -- do you think the economy stepped in a pothole? Is there something specific to the merchant market itself that's causing you problems? And then second question would be, you mentioned throwing some more feet in sales attention. I know you guys have done that in various iterations in the past in various regions. So can you talk about what the lag time is between putting those people in the field and actually starting to see some revenue on the P&L?
Paul Huck: Sure, yes. Certainly, Bob. And if you take the economy in North America, certainly the economy in North America has kind of hit a soft patch. As we look at -- there's still a lot of uncertainty around there. You don't -- you have to be blind to not see it on every news channel and every newspaper about what's happening with the various things on the debt crisis. And that worries us. So that worries consumers, which then worries the -- a business, which has to invest. We're not creating jobs, and so if I got -- we got to get beyond this uncertainty. So hopefully, as we go through this summer, we resolve some of these issues. We start to move forward. We take some better and get firmer on what the policy actions will be, we'll see the economy -- the uncertainty start to lift a little bit off the economy and people start making decisions with regard to that. But if you look at any of the production statistics for the U.S., they have been trending downward, as far as the growth rate was concerned. The first half of our fiscal year, which is the last quarter of the calendar year in '10 and the first quarter of the calendar year in 2011, certainly had a stronger economy from a manufacturing standpoint. We were probably seeing growth somewhere in the 6% to 7% range. We are seeing growth less than half of that in the third and fourth quarter, if we're lucky, given things. So then if you look at that, the impact of our sales force, we started to increase our sales force post the -- post-thing in which happened with Airgas. And so we have already started to see the signings get better for us, and so we are seeing that with our people. So I think it doesn't take too long for our sales guys to become effective and start to add some business. It does take us, as I said, some time to bring that business onstream. So it's normally 6, maybe 9 months until that business starts to come onstream.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: So Paul, with your Tonnage, oxygen and nitrogen business, excluding the hydrogen part, would that mirror the kind of volume trends you've seen in Merchant?
Paul Huck: Yes, it would. As we look at that, yes, it would. We have seen -- we've been seeing slow growth. If you look at steel operating rates, steel operatings are a little bit better than -- and than they were a year ago, around the world, I mean. The world's hit somewhat of a soft patch here.
Simon Moore: And bob, just as we mentioned, too, very slow growth, but we did have some positive in liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon in North America. There was some offset with helium supply constraints, limited helium growth.
Operator: We'll go next to Mike Harrison from First Analyst.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation: Wanted to just ask a couple more questions around the margins in the Merchant business. You talked about the need to get volume in North America and pricing in Europe. I think both of those things are a little bit market- and competitive-environment dependent. But with respect to the operational issues and the need to reduce some of the dislocation costs, et cetera, how much of those issues have been fixed at this point and things are taken care of, and to the extent that they can give you confidence that you'll see margin improvement from those areas where you have more control over your own destiny, so to speak?
Paul Huck: And so, Michael, the way this works is you fix one and another one popped up, and that's somewhat of what we saw between quarter 2 and quarter 3. So far, for our look at this, it's just -- it's hitting a lot of singles of making sure we run our plants well and do a better job. So it's not one issue, it's a number of issues. And they're small, and they're at different plants around here. And so it's going to be something which we're going to have to pay attention to. With regard to some of the issues, which I mentioned, argon availability has been an issue for us. We do have capacity coming onstream in the on-site area, in both the U.S. and Asia, which will help our argon availability around the world. We have -- we've brought some argon capacity on time at Xingtai Steel, as an example. That will help us. We have a plant coming onstream towards the end of our fiscal year in LaPorte, Texas, which will help us with argon availability and also cut down on the distribution costs. So it's going to be -- it's not one thing, which we can do to fix it, it's a number of things. And then it just getting on to getting the benefits out of our -- out of us, the service center investments, which we've made and things like that. So we've -- we can do these things. You've seen the progress or focus which we've made on SG&A as a company. SG&A, we didn't make a big deal about it, but SG&A is under 10% of sales this quarter. If you take currency out of it, SG&A is down year-on-year for us. So we've made -- we continue to make a lot of progress in those areas. We can take cost out. We can be successful at this. We applied the tools, we applied the information systems, which we have. We've make good decisions, and we can get this done.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation: And then in terms of Merchant pricing in Asia, it seems to be decelerating a little bit compared to what you showed in the last couple of quarters. Can you disaggregate for us what's going on in LOX/LIN pricing in Asia versus LAR, and maybe talk a little bit about the outlook for Merchant pricing, given the inflationary environment we're seeing in Asia?
Paul Huck: Simon, why don't you take that?
Simon Moore: Sure, yes, Mike. And as you pointed out, we talked to the last couple of quarters about the spot opportunities we had in argon, and so that was one of the drivers. We still had positive pricing in LOX/LIN in Asia this, quarter year-on-year, that we have done. So in the low single-digits types of numbers. So obviously, the argon spot opportunities have wound their way through the system a little bit, and so we continue to see positive pricing in Asia. I think we're able to recover the increased costs that we have there. So I think low single digits going forward is something that we would expect to be able to deliver.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation: And then last one is on the interest expense. You saw about a $3 million decline quarter-on-quarter, even though your debt level went up, to some extent that's driven by increased short-term borrowings. But just -- can we get any guidance maybe on what the interest expense number could look like over the next couple of quarters?
Paul Huck: Yes. And if you take a look at that, it is obviously going to depend upon the floating rates. I mean, the -- a portion of that was rates, a portion of that was capitalized interest, which you saw here for us in this time period. But I would expect the interest rate, the interest expense for us to grow as we increase borrowings to fund the capital.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Kevin McCarthy: Paul, in Tonnage, what was the impact of the customer maintenance outages that you referenced in the quarter? And were those complete by the end of the quarter, or is there any residual spillover into the fiscal fourth quarter?
Paul Huck: The actions and -- were complete. As we look at the maintenance spending, costs us $0.04 or so a share, when you look at that. So less substantial in a year-over-year. Quarter-to-quarter wasn't a big deal, and we probably get a benefit of a similar amount going forward into quarter 4. And they are complete, Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy: Very good. And then, shifting over to Merchant, Paul. In your prepared remarks, I guess you indicated 4 separate issues that you thought were pressuring margins there. One of them was tight helium supply. Can you comment on that and maybe size the impact of that, in terms of any volume constraints? I think you indicated elevated procurement costs as well there.
Paul Huck: Right, yes. It's actually a long answer for this one. I'll try to keep it short in the interest of time. Helium has been tight around the world. It is a commodity which ships around the world. And you don't ship in the gas, you ship in liquid form, in containers. But it has been tight due to various production issues around the world and continued strong growth, a lot of the growth being driven by the electronics industry for -in the uses of helium. We do have new capacity coming onstream within the United States towards the end of calendar year '11, which will help our supply things. One of the things that has -- which is a factor here is the Bureau of Mines, I think it is, in the United States, BOM, but landmines. They have a storage amount of helium, which they have gradually been selling off, in which we own a portion of it, our competitors own a portion of that, and that amount is going away. And so we are going to become more reliant on foreign sources of helium globally, and the procurement costs for that is higher for these things, as we attempt to take these helium. It mainly occurs -- it occurs in gas fields and you strip it out and then you purify it. So it's -- it is something which we manage. We are the largest supplier of helium in the world, so it is a -- it impacts us a decent amount, but we also think that we have a good handle on that. It's just the need that prices are going to have to go up as we see higher costs for procuring the raw helium.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: The equity income in the quarter was about $40 million, which was a lot more than it was in the first 2 quarters. How did things get so much better there and what's the outlook going forward?
Paul Huck: The outlook going forward is for that to continue, Jeff. As we look at that, we think our Equity Affiliates, they're good solid businesses. We told you they got #1 positions in a number of markets. But the gains occurred in the Merchant area, principally Mexico and India. In the Tonnage area, we have some JVs in China, which are starting to contribute now as we build the plants and bring them online. And in our Electronics ventures, we have Electronics ventures with DuPont, which had a -- which had very good quarters and which we expect to also continue. So, yes, we expect this level of profitability to continue, and they will grow.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Sometimes in the fourth quarter your payables steps up by $300 million, and sometimes it steps up by about $100 million. You've used a lot of working capital so far this year. What's the working capital outlook on the fourth quarter?
Paul Huck: Well, the working capital -- if you're trying to get at free cash flow, then I give you from that. As far as the working capital, the payable steps up because the classification of the pension and our expectations over how much we're going to contribute within the next year. I would expect that our pension contributions in this year will not be as -- for -- in 2012, will not be as large as they were in 2011 or 2010. But that's a decision still to be made as we close out the year. There will be some pension contribution, but that's what causes the payables to step up. As far as overall, I think we've got a very good story on free cash flow for the year, though. And I expect -- and we had a very good quarter in this quarter, if you just look at that and you adjust some of the things about -- out about the operating cash flow. But we had free cash flow in excess of $100 million this quarter, and I would expect us to be somewhere $100 million, $150 million in the fourth quarter also.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then lastly, and you may have covered this, your pricing in Electronics year-over-year is plus 3. And in the old days, those numbers used to be 0 or negative 1. Why are the price realizations so much better now?
Paul Huck: Simon?
Simon Moore: Yes. Great question. So...
Paul Huck: Former business here.
Simon Moore: So as we talked to the Investor Conference, I think we are seeing a fundamental change in the Electronics business. So I'll talk about Electronics first. We did see very significant declines in pricing if you go back over the last 10 years. But we've definitely seen a stabilization of those larger volume, more mature products, and that's why we were commenting about stable pricing going forward. I did mention that, in fact, actually NF3 is up slightly year-on-year and sequentially, and what's offsetting that and bringing that to flat for Electronics is the great news that some of our new products are being adopted by our customers. What happens when we work out these new products, our customer is doing, let's say, a test quantity, we might be supplying from a small pilot plant, and we need a certain price. But for the customer to agree to adopt that product in full production, they need to have a price roadmap and understand where that's going to go before they commit to it. So we often, when we have our new product, we'll pre-renegotiate, let's say, a share of the savings, a price volume curve. So actually, seeing prices go down in those new products is very good because it shows that they're being adopted. So if you take the more mature products, slightly up. The newer products, slightly down. That's where Electronics is fairly stable. Of course, the other part of the segment is Performance Materials, where the team's done a great job of basically recovering some cost increases with some higher prices, and that's what's driven the segment.
Operator: We'll go next to Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: This is Lucy Watson on for Laurence today. Question on Merchant volumes. You mentioned a couple of times that they were slow in the U.S. and Europe. I just -- I'm wondering if this was relatively consistent across the quarter, or did you see gradual improvements or declines from month-to-month? And I guess also exiting the quarter as well, have you seen any change?
Paul Huck: It was consistent across the quarter, Lucy, in volumes. As I said about the economy, we've -- we have seen the economy globally hit a little bit of a soft patch. it's not -- you can see that in the statistics there.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then in your -- the increased quarter-over-quarter in your Equipment and Energy backlog, it looks like it was mostly due to the addition of the new floating LNG facility.
Paul Huck: That is right.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Can you just, I guess, expand on us -- for us on the potential addressable market opportunities for offshore gas liquefaction facilities and then the expected timeline for this?
Paul Huck: Sure. Okay, I'm sorry. And there are a number of projects, which people are considering as ways to explore a projects which are not onshore. This is an alternate to running a pipeline into shore to take the gas in and then liquefy it there. It also enables you to take smaller deposits and then to move the platform at some point in time, so you would do that. So as we look at the future for gas around the world, we see gas being more and more utilized as to make chemicals and also to make power. It has some advantages, as far as on the carbon side naturally with -- and with regard to the power, plus with the events of people -- with the events in Japan and the shutdown of nuclear power plants, we see more and more LNG occurring around the world. It may not come into -- probably will not come into the United States, but certainly, we're going to see more LNG coming to places like Europe. We're going to see more LNG coming to places like Japan, India, China, big market for us going forward in the future.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. And one last quick question. Does FX play a role in your forecasting for CapEx for next year, or is that just additional product -- projects that you'd expect to come onstream?
Paul Huck: It does what? I missed it.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Does currency play a role in the volume now?
Paul Huck: Currency? No, no, no. Currency is -- do not play a big impact.
Operator: We'll go next to David Manthey of Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: It sounds like you think that the North American Merchant softness was broad-based, but do you feel that you lost any share, or is it just market weakness? Or was it just weakness where you are, or could you just go to a little detail there?
Paul Huck: If I take a look overall, over this time period, over a longer time period and not particularly on to one quarter here, it exists, and we probably have lost some share in the United States.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Okay. And then in terms of the backlog. The increase there, the 20% to 30% off the high end of the old range, it implies that projects are -- in the backlog, are starting to break loose. Is that the case, or are you also, at the same time, betting on winning more orders going forward? And then secondarily, if you can talk about that roughly $2 billion in CapEx, any comments on geographies or if it's hydrogen or where it's weighted?
Paul Huck: Sure. If we just take a look at the CapEx here going forward, so -- in regard to backlog, like I said, I think the real number you got to look at is capital spending. And so it isn't so much of a projects trying to break loose, you put a project in the backlog and then you have a certain curve, which you spend the money on with things. And certainly, a bigger backlog is probably better for you, but the real number, what you want to see, is growth in CapEx. As we look at growth in CapEx for next year, if we look at the spending in '11, it's probably 40% in the Americas, 20% in Europe and 40% in Asia. We think that, that number starts to tilt more towards Asia, going forward here, although Americas still has strong growth for that because of the hydrogen projects, which we -- to which we're currently building. Europe probably tones down a little bit because we have 2 large projects which we are building there, and it hasn't been as strong. The Middle East probably picks up some things for us within the next year or so, as far as backlog's concerned, but I would say that we are going to see a more tilt in ourself towards Asia as far as the spending is concerned.
Simon Moore: And just to clarify, Dave, too, that was capital spending that Paul mentioned could be up 20% to 30%, not backlog.
Paul Huck: Yes, right. It's not backlog.
Simon Moore: Not necessarily, okay?
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Cozzone of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Peter Cozzone - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: You may have alluded to this a little bit already. But on the North American Merchant front, I'm just trying to kind of get some more color around if the operating issues you experience during the quarter may have impacted volumes, and to maybe what extent that might have accounted for some of the share pressure here during the quarter?
Paul Huck: Yes, and the operating issues were not confined to North America. We had operating issues around the world. That's a broad comment on the Merchant segment.
Simon Moore: But I think we would say, generally speaking, we're able to keep our customers supplied. Perhaps on the helium side, we mentioned supply limitations on the helium did impact growth opportunities there.
Peter Cozzone - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay. And then kind of as you look at 4Q here or in second half of calendar 2011. I'm just -- maybe could you provide some more color around the Electronics outlook, if you're hearing any indications from customers that would suggest anything than normal seasonality? And then also maybe on TV front, maybe some color as far as what you're hearing for the outlook for the rest of the year in that market?
Simon Moore: Yes. Good question. So a lot of different things in Electronics. We acknowledged in our comments that we are seeing some subsegments that are little bit softer, particularly the foundry segment. I think TSMC has mentioned they see utilization rates down a little bit going forward. Kind of on the flip side of that is on Intel's call, they referenced, and I quote, "Increasing confidence in the second half of the year." We still see growth in TV and LED. Again, perhaps the growth rates are moderating a little bit. When we take a look at MSI, we had thought MSI for the year, and I'm going back to our comments back in October, was up 5% to 10% for FY '11 over FY '10. I think that we're going to see a little flatter back half of the year in the industry, and we saw a very strong second half FY '10. So when you put that together, we could see MSI growth, year-on-year, to be below that lower end of our range. Having said that, we still see some strength. Apple obviously had tremendous results. And as we've explained a few times, the pull-through from iPads and iPhones, both in terms of the computer chips in those devices themselves, but again the processing technology capability that has to be in the servers that are doing the math in the cloud, if you will, continues to drive business forward. So I think we should -- we see probably moderating, but no significant drop off at all going forward.
Peter Cozzone - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay. Kind of just a follow-on. You mentioned some new product wins in the Electronics business. Could you -- do you expect a meaningful benefit, I guess near term, on the volume from here as those products ramp up, or maybe also what type of margin impact do these new products generally carry?
Paul Huck: Yes. And that's going to be a gradual impact, as they start to be deployed. And as we said, as our customer put them into full production. So they will have an impact with us over time, and we'll continue the growth of this business.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Gulley of Ticonderoga Securities.
Mark Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC: Paul, I thought the highlight of your prepared remarks was the increase in CapEx for next year. You've already talked about the geographic side of that, but going back to your Investor Day, I was struck by the fact that a lot of that new CapEx in Tonnage is going to go for oxygen for, let's say, coal conversion projects in China. So are you starting to see that ramp up next year? Is that adding to your confidence in oxygen for next year in Tonnage?
Paul Huck: Yes. The simple answer, Mark, is yes. That's yes. We are seeing the orders there, and those are in that forecast.
Mark Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC: Okay. Now does the forecast also include some more steel projects in emerging markets, overall?
Paul Huck: Yes.
Mark Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC: Okay. And then finally -- thanks for the short answers.
Paul Huck: Pleasure.
Mark Gulley - Ticonderoga Securities LLC: With respect to the Merchant side. Half your sales and earnings -- we've had 2 straight quarters here now of some of bumps in the road. On the one hand, you're looking for more volume in the U.S., but is that going to be at the sacrifice of price as you have more feet on the street? And I guess in other areas, you're looking for more price in Europe. Could that contribute to some volume pressure there? So you face some kind of vexing trends to boost results in Merchant.
Paul Huck: You're right. But that's why we pay people a lot of money to do this work, Mark. And not to be flip on that, but that's true. We have to balance, and I think we've proven we can do that. If you take a look at within the U.S., we think it's an issue of sales coverage and getting broader sales coverage out to certain accounts, and we don't think we have to go out and sacrifice price with that. With regard to Europe, as we said, there are also some accounts in which we look at and which if the price doesn't go up at, and we don't want to serve those accounts.
Operator: We'll go next to David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG: This is James Sheehan sitting in for David. Paul, do you see anything sitting here in fiscal Q4 right now that would lead you to expect that you could not achieve your long-term growth, EPS growth forecast of 15% for fiscal 2012?
Paul Huck: No. I think we are on track, as we've talked about at the Investor Day, and that we are -- and that we will continue to move forward. You're always going to have some bumps in the road, but we're going to manage our way through them. We're going to fix them, and we're going to move on and deliver the results.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG: So how much of that target depends on fixing the problems in Merchant Gases or on getting improvement, continued sustained improvements in Electronics?
Paul Huck: Well, the Merchant business is a big portion of our business. It's about 40% of the company. So we've got to make sure that, that performs. So as you look at this, we got to make sure Merchant does a good job. I think you've seen the progress which we've made in Electronics and Performance Materials, very solid business are at levels of performance, which a number of people, over the years, have questioned if we could ever get even close to those levels of performance. And we think we can sustain that and continue to make it better.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG: So just with reference to this hot weather we're having in July. Do you see any impacts on that on the efficiency of your plants or in terms of higher electricity costs?
Paul Huck: Yes, you're right. It does not help you -- it does not help the efficiency of our plants. Now the good news is I got a lot of it -- I got a lot of capacity here, because it cuts down actually on how much I can actually make.
James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay. And, Paul, can you just give me a little color on the -- on pricing in packaged gases in Europe? Is it getting stronger there?
Paul Huck: The pricing in packaged gases is -- has been okay for us. I think it always could get better for us. The thing which we are not seeing is we aren't seeing -- we are not seeing the volume growth yet in Europe on packaged gases. The volume growth has not been good, just particularly in the south, in Spain.
Operator: That will come from Edward Yang of Oppenheimer.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Paul, you mentioned that you expect to -- or you're willing to shed some unprofitable customers in Europe. I was wondering how meaningful that could be. And second, you mentioned cement and combustion is 2 areas in Europe where you feel like you could gain some share, and I was wondering what your particular expertise there is relative to your competitors.
Paul Huck: Yes. And with regard to expertise, it gets down to applications and it gets to particular areas. We do have a combustion lab, which is world class, which we can bring our customers into. And they can see -- they could see flame patterns. They could see how oxygen really will help them and make them better. Examples of that are our position and the success which we've had in the glass market, as an example for us, by taking the glass companies in here and showing how we can -- how -- what sort of things we can do to help them raise the efficiency and the environmental performance of their plants with regard to that, I mean. And as far as the -- on the customer side of things, I -- in the end, I think all of this has -- the impact of this is that it increases your margins. Our experience with this is you don't want -- you don't loose a lot of business by doing this. I'll tell you, we've gone through this in the United States years ago, of taking customers' prices up and you -- and pretty much you wind up getting the bulk of them up, and it comes down to the thing of it. You got to make -- at every customer, you got to be able to make a profit, and that's just the way it is.
Simon Moore: Okay. So that wraps up, Augusta.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.
Simon Moore: Thanks, Augusta. Thank you for joining us, and have a nice day.

Simon Moore: Thank you, Elizabeth. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO Paul Huck and I will review our Q2 results and outlook for the remainder of 2011.  We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on the website. Please turn to Slide 2.  As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release, explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide #3. With half of our fiscal year behind us, we are well on our way towards delivering on our 2011 financial goals. For the quarter, sales of $2.5 billion were up 11% versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 12% on 11% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing.  Sequentially, sales were 5% higher. Underlying sales were up 3%, with volumes contributing 2% and pricing adding 1%. This sequential improvement was driven primarily by our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Merchant Gases segment. Operating income of $425 million increased 17% from prior year, primarily on higher volumes. Our operating margins improved to 17%, up 80 basis points versus prior year. We remain on track to deliver on our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 16% and diluted earnings per share increased by 15%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13.3%, up 110 basis points. Turning to Slide 4 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% or $0.18 per share. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.27 year-on-year. The impact of pricing, combined with energy and raw material costs, attracted $0.02. Costs were $0.04 unfavorable, as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating, maintenance and distribution costs, particularly in our Merchant segment. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact, and the higher tax rate and higher shares outstanding cost us a $0.01 each. In March, we announced an 18% dividend increase, marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are all proud of this record. Also, in this past quarter, we repurchased $350 million of our stock, about 3.8 million shares. We have $300 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. In summary, this was another quarter of solid gains in sales, earnings, margins and returns. Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of just over $1 billion were up 10% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 9% on 8% higher volumes and positive pricing. Currency increased sales by 1%. Year-on-year sales improvement was driven by volume growth across the segment, with the greatest improvement in Asia. Sequentially, sales were up 3% with underlying sales up 2% even with the lunar New Year holiday. Merchant Gases operating income of $185 million was up 4% versus prior year and down 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 18.3% was down 100 basis points versus prior year and down 200 basis points sequentially. Versus last year, volume leverage was more than offset by higher operating, maintenance and distribution costs and lower pricing in European healthcare. We had a number of plant operating challenges that increased maintenance costs and resulted in a higher distribution cost, as we reallocated our supply chain to meet customers' needs. Versus prior quarter, the same cost impacts, combined with the smaller sequential volume increase, drove the margin decline. We believe these challenges are largely behind us and expect operating margins to improve through the rest of the year. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 3% on growth across all product lines. Pricing was positive with a 2% broad-based increased led by Helium. LOX/LIN pricing was up 2%. LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the mid-70s. During the quarter, we announced plans to construct a new liquid nitrogen production facility in Mooreland, Oklahoma, to further strengthen our leadership position in supplying the region's oil field services market. We also announced an increase in merchant oxygen and argon production at Middletown, Ohio. This facility and expansion are fully integrated with an increase of our on-site oxygen supply. These 2 opportunities were driven by specific opportunities to create value. As always, we will carefully consider loadings, as we manage capacity going forward. In Europe, sales increased 3% versus last year. Volumes were up 4% with strong liquid bulk growth, particularly liquid oxygen and nitrogen, up 9%. Packaged gas volumes were up slightly, and healthcare volumes were flat. Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing offset by unfavorable healthcare and liquid bulk pricing. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. In Asia, sales were up 30% versus last year, with underlying sales up 25%. Volumes were up 18%, with strength across all products led by the electronics market. Pricing was also strong, up 7%, the highest increase in over 4 years. We were able to continue to take advantage of the higher spot argon pricing in China that we mentioned last quarter. LOX/LIN pricing stayed strong across Asia, up 3%. Plant loadings were in the mid-80s, with a slight dip through the lunar New Year. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage gases sales of $799 million, increased 6% versus last year, with volumes up 10% in energy and raw material pass-through decreasing sales by 5%. The volume increase was primarily driven by our refinery hydrogen customers. Sequentially, sales were up 4% on flat volumes and higher energy and raw material pass-through. New plant volume growth was offset by scheduled outages. These maintenance outages are scheduled to coincide with our customer outages to eliminate any impact on their operations. Operating income of $121 million rose 13% from the prior year on higher new plant volumes and increased operating efficiencies, particularly in our Gulf Coast system. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 90 basis points versus prior year, due to improved operating efficiency and lower natural gas costs pass-through. Moving to new business. We announced an increase of our pipeline hydrogen supply to Marathon Petroleum in Garyville, Louisiana. We are pleased with this latest expansion of our relationship, as we have been supplying this refinery for almost 20 years. Marathon will continue to benefit from the reliability and flexibility of the Air Products Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system. This is the world's largest hydrogen pipeline. As I mentioned in the Merchant discussion, we also announced the expansion of our facility in Middletown, Ohio, including a new air separation unit and a new hydrogen production plant. We have been supplying pipeline and Merchant customers from this facility since the 1960s. Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $576 million were up 28% compared to last year on 23% higher volumes and 3% positive pricing. Sequentially, sales were up 9% on 6% higher volumes and 2% higher prices.  Electronics sales were up 33% compared to last year and up 6% sequentially, as the industry continued to demonstrate strong growth. This sequential sales increase is particularly notable given the typical slowdown for Lunar New Year. Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 16% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Ongoing Tonnage sales were up 18% versus prior year and 3% sequentially, and our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and sequentially. The Electronics Specialty Materials pricing was essentially flat versus last year and last quarter. Performance Materials sales increased 22% versus last year, with volumes up 16% and pricing up 5%. Our pricing actions successfully recovered increased raw material costs. Sequentially, sales rose 14% with a stronger-than-typical rebound from normal Q1 seasonality. Segment operating income of $92 million is the highest ever for this segment, up 61% versus prior year, primarily due to volume leverage and the positive effect of the Electronics restructuring actions taken last year. Income was up 33% sequentially due to volume leverage and the inventory revaluation in Q1. The segment operating margin of 15.9% improved 330 basis points from last year, due to higher volumes and improved productivity. Sequentially, margins were up to 280 basis points on higher volumes and the Q1 inventory revaluation. In terms of the Japan tragedy, our first thoughts go to the victims and their recovery efforts. We did not see any significant impact on our business during Q2. In terms of new business, last month, we announced a new nitrogen plant and pipeline at our Hwaseong, Korea site to supply Samsung Electronics fabs in the Hwaseong-Giheung area. And yesterday, we announced an expansion of our Carlsbad, California electronic materials development and production facility, supporting product development, process demonstration, new product scale-up and performance testing to create the next-generation materials our electronics customers needs. Now please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $114 million were down 5% versus prior year and up 1%, sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $23 million increased 24% versus prior year and 11% sequentially due to higher LNG activity. Our backlog is lower, both versus prior year and sequentially. We expect it to improve by the end of the year.  We did announce the new LNG technology and equipment order from JGC Corporation for the 2 million ton per year Donggi-Senoro LNG project in Indonesia. Air Products' leading LNG technology has been supporting projects in Indonesia since the late 1970s. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Simon. Now if you'll turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.42 to $1.47, which is a year-over-year growth of 11% to 15% and is based on the following factors.  On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. We also expect better cost performance in our Merchant segment, as the operating and related distribution impacts should not repeat this quarter. And our fiscal quarter three tax rate will be lower, as we anticipate closing some open tax audits. Our tax rate next quarter should be 24% to 25%. For the year, we expect the rate to come in towards the lower end of our original guidance range of 25% to 26%. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Tonnage, results will be down sequentially. We expect that our operating bonuses will be lower, as these bonuses are tied to contract year end, and quarter two is our peak bonus quarter. Also, quarter three will be the highest quarter for maintenance spending this year. As Simon told you, we coincide our maintenance outage timing with our customer plant shutdowns. For quarter four, we expect significantly higher operating income in Tonnage. And in Equipment and Energy, we expect lower results, as our air separation unit backlog is currently low. As a result, we expect operating income in the second half of the year will be about half of what we recorded in the first half. As Simon mentioned, we expect to add orders to our backlog by fiscal year end. To date, we have not experienced any significant business impacts from the Japan tragedy. Japan represents only about 2% of our revenue. While our electronics customers are continuing to operate at high utilization rates, there is still some uncertainty on the potential global supply chain impact. On balance, we do not expect any material impact on our business and have reflected this in our guidance. For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions from the beginning of the year remain unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance also remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion. With half of our fiscal year completed, we're raising our earnings per share guidance, increasing our full year guidance range to $5.65 to $5.75, 13% to 15% growth over last year. Now let me wrap up. With the first half of our fiscal year behind us, we are off to a great start in 2011, with sales and earnings continuing to grow. We also continue to improve our operating margin and our return on capital. As I mentioned, we are all proud of the fact that we increased our dividend by 18%, marking 29 consecutive years of increases. We are confident that we can continue to drive strong growth and higher returns over our planning horizon.  Before the recession, we generated annual top line growth of 14% from 2004 through 2008, with underlying growth of 9%. As we have emerged from the recession, we have seen this underlying growth rate increase and have consistently beaten our competitors. We expect that our revenue growth will continue this strong pace because of the following factors: First, with the world experiencing higher energy costs and more environmental pressures, we are seeing industrial gases being used in more and more processes, applications and industries, as companies look to increase energy efficiency and improved environmental performance. Second, as the manufacturing grows in the emerging markets to serve the needs of their large populations, we are seeing industrial gas usage grow significantly in those countries.  Finally, Air Products' leading position in the electronics, hydrogen and energy markets, coupled with our leading position in a number of the Asian countries, makes us the industrial gas company that has the best opportunity to take advantage of these macro trends. We've also demonstrated our commitment to improve returns by increasing our return on capital employed by about 300 basis points over the past 6 years. We believe we have a number of opportunities to further expand our returns. Some examples are: As we look to the future, we still have operating leverage in our existing facilities. We are also pursuing a number of programs to improve the way we price our products, simplify the way we do business with our customers and suppliers, improve the efficiency and output of our plants and lower the capital costs of our investments.  We are excited by these opportunities and believe that they will make us the best investment in our industry going forward. To find out more about what we are doing and what our long-term goals are, please join us at our investor conference on June 9 for a day of presentations, questions-and-answers and interactive discussions regarding Air Products strategy, opportunities and outlook. You will have a chance to discuss our businesses and interface with a broad cross section of our management team. If you're interested in attending, please contact our Investor Relations team. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Elizabeth to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question this morning will come from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you. Paul, the margin trend in Electronics, up 280 basis points sequentially, certainly more than we would have anticipated, can you elaborate on the drivers there? And now that it's eclipsed to your 15% goal, should we be thinking of this new level as sustainable? It doesn't sound like you anticipate meaningful impacts from Japan.
Paul Huck: Yes. Kevin, a couple of questions, which you have there. First, regarding Electronics and the Electronics margins. We certainly intend to continue to drive margins in that business. The thing, which has driven them are two things: First, we have very strong volume growth, not only from our existing product but some of the new products, which we've introduced. And those new products come in at a very nice margin for us. So that has helped, and the leverage on our facilities certainly has helped. Second, as everyone knows, we have put that group through a lot of changes over the past few years and those changes have paid off in increased margins and better operations for that facility, for their facilities and the way they operate. So yes, we do think that we have a sustainable model in there and that we will continue to experience good growth. With regard to Japan, from an Electronics standpoint, we don't -- to date we have not seen any real impacts. We watched our volumes very closely through April. Our volumes look good with things. We've talked our customers. Our customers continue to operate. There's obviously people who are concerned about supply chain. Apple recently commented that they do not see any issues with it. That's good news from our standpoint, because they are downstream, people who produce units. And so, we hope that, as we go forward, and that it won't be a problem for us.
Kevin McCarthy: And then second question, if I may, Paul, on Merchant margins, you had 100 basis points erosion year-over-year, 200 there sequentially. I guess I heard a number of issues on Lunar New Year distribution costs, the new [ph] healthcare. Can you help us understand how much of that pressure you would view as transitory versus potentially more durable through the balance of the fiscal year?
Paul Huck: And so, with regard to margins, we are certainly not happy with the results, which have come through on the Merchant area. If you look at it, we did get the volume leverage that we have had. We've had good volume growth in the business here. We lost the volume leverage, principally because of a couple of items. Number one, we had some operating problems at facilities, which caused us, actually, distribution cost to move product around, higher cost to operate and maintain those facilities and fix those problems. Now some of those costs will go away in the next quarter, but there will be more costs, which need to go away in the longer term to get that. The second factor is that we have not delivered in this quarter, we have not delivered the productivity gains, which we have planned upon. And that's something, which we need to fix and get moving forward. We constantly have inflation in this business, as anyone in any business has. We aim to more than offset our inflation on the productivity end. We did not do that this quarter, obviously, and we fell back a little bit. And so, we are attempting to come out of that. Will margins jump back up to the quarter one levels in quarter three? We're going to try to get them back up, but that's a large test for us. I will tell you that right now. But we do expect to start to see continued improvement, as we look to the future here and see margins improve on a sequential basis in quarter three and in quarter four.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you, Paul.
Operator: We'll take our next question from John McNulty with Crédit Suisse.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Just two quick questions. On the Electronics front, it looks like the volumes came in noticeably higher than what I guess you had guided for the full year or at the beginning of the year. So I'm wondering how we should be thinking about the growth going forward based on what you're hearing from your customers?
Paul Huck: Yes, I mean, and we expect that the Electronics volumes to continue to grow. Now whether we will see as strong as seasonal impact in quarter three and quarter four as we have in other years, I think remains to be seen. But we are certainly expecting to see volumes grow sequentially, as we go into the last half of the year. Simon, I don't know if you have any other comments on what you've seen.
Simon Moore: No, thanks, Paul. I think just another thing to point out to, really, from an MSI standpoint, we would still be consistently aligned with our original guidance, and I think that lines out well with the third-party measures. I think some of the things that we talked about that continue to allow us to grow at a higher level than MSI is our strength with the leading producers in that industry, our strength in the leading regions and then beginning to see some benefit from some of the smaller, faster-growing areas in the LED and TV. So MSI guidance kind of consistent with where we said, but we see the opportunity to grow faster than MSI.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, great. And then, with regard to your LNG equipment business. It sounds like the backlog, you're expecting it to start firming up later on this year. In terms of discussions that you've had with some of your potential customers, how are you thinking about the opportunities now in the U.S. with companies and regions looking to monetize this strain of natural gas?
Paul Huck: And so, regarding the LNG equipment backlog. The LNG equipment backlog, for us, is strong. As far as the equipment backlog, our shortfall to what our plans were exist in the air separation plant orders. So the LNG equipment businesses, it looks very good. As far as going and trying to export, and with LNG out of the U.S., there are people who are taking looks at that. These projects do take a long time to develop and are subject to a lot of ups and downs with things. We will go out and support those projects and look at those things. I think -- this is just a personal one for me. I think it's going to be tough to get one and to get a permit within the United States to export LNG, but we'll see what happens.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Yes, Paul, a quick question on your -- this negative operating leverage in margin. I understand you had some maintenance issues and all that. If you exclude those issues for 10% top line growth, what kind of operating income growth should you see?
Paul Huck: Yes, well, if you take a look at how much operating income growth from a sales growth, if we see our sales this quarter, so if you just take our sales this quarter, we're up about $90 million from the past year. And so, if I then take a look at that and say, "Well, how much was due to pass-through of higher cost and raw material cost?" And that's about $11 million. Currency took us up about $12 million on those things. And so, the growth in volume for us was about $70 million, when you look at that just on a rough number. We would expect operating income to grow somewhere around $20 million or so based upon that, P.J., for that. So it's somewhere around 0.3x the sales, whatever the sales growth would be, but that gives you some numbers, which you can work on from there. And we didn't see this, this quarter. I mean, to be honest with you, we didn't see it, and we're not very happy with that.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Okay, that's fair enough. And can you discuss your overall project pipeline, not just LNG but overall backlog of on-site projects and...
Paul Huck: Sure, yes.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: How is that progressing? I mean, is it accelerating? Is it sort of flat in terms of its growth?
Paul Huck: Yes, and so I'll turn to the equipment backlog, which we actually tracked. We tracked these two things on a separate basis. The equipment backlog is one of aspect of things, and the capital project backlog is another aspect of things. So if you take a look at our capital backlog for us, our capital backlog is about $2 billion at the end of this quarter. At the end of last quarter, I think I told you on the call, it was $1.8 billion. So we are up over 10%. So we have seen some award activity occur in this quarter, which is good news for us, because we were expecting that stuff to occur. It is principally on-site projects. So when I look at that backlog, three quarters of it is on the Tonnage side, 15% in the Merchant area and 10% in Electronics for us, as we go forward here. It's spread across the world. So we have projects in North America, in Asia and Europe, also for us.
Simon Moore: I think maybe the other point then, too, would be as always you heard Paul reaffirm our perspective on CapEx guidance for FY '11, which will be up 15% to 30% over last year.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: If I may just ask one more quick question. You are announcing some new Merchant plants -- Oklahoma, Ohio. I think last quarter, you announced a couple of plants in India. I mean, are you seeing your competitors, and you getting more into Merchant business or maybe these Merchant plants?
Paul Huck: Well, as far as the announcements within the United States, as Simon said to you, they were opportunities, which presented us. One was around an on-site supply. So people are going to do that, and the other one was for a particular market and the opportunity for injection for LIN for frac-ing for the oil field services area. And so, as far as the U.S. is concerned, we aren't seeing a whole lot of activity with people announcing plants there. I think we are seeing activity with people announcing plants in Asia with those things, but that goes with the manufacturing growth.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Okay, this is not a big merchant capital cycle coming up?
Paul Huck: No, it is not. No, I think the disappointment [ph] -- see, if you take a look, most of our capacity, most of our capacity, P.J., comes as we look to the future here. Capacity additions are going to be in Asia. They're going to be around the emerging markets, and particularly China. India will have some, but China will have more. China is going to be the biggest market for industrial gases out here in the future someday with the amount of the manufacturing that is done there. And so, as that manufacturing needs grow, they drive a need for more and more gases from the Merchant side. And so, that growth is normal, our operating rates mid 80s to high 80s across the board in those countries. So we are in very good shape there from a loading capacity standpoint. And we need new capacity, as we project out in the future, just to take the normal market growth. You got manufacturing still growing at a double-digit rate in China. It's over 10% this year.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Your operating income year-over-year was up 24% from 3 40 to 4 20, but your equity affiliate's income was down from $32 million to, I don't know, $31 million and change. Why such a difference in performance?
Paul Huck: Well, one of the things, which we did, as you know, we have an equity affiliate, which we dropped out in this last quarter. So that's a slight drop with things for us. Our equity affiliates are performing well, we think. And as we look at it around the world, we think we are in good shape there.
Simon Moore: I think, we did see, if you will, a growth in those ventures in sort of base business aspect of it. The reported results, there was a number of things that Paul mentioned in terms of changes of ownerships, some legal costs, inventory valuations. So the key, I think, is that those ventures continue to perform and grow as we expect them to.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Alright. And then lastly, your depreciation charges, both for the quarter and for the first six months are flat at about $435 million, but your CapEx last year was $1 billion, which is above depreciation. And this year, you're doing whatever it is, $1.5 billion. Why are the depreciation and amortization charges growing faster?
Paul Huck: I think one of the things, which you're seeing is, as we look at this, you're seeing more and more on-site investment. If you look at our total PP&E in the ground, more and more on-site investment, which is 15- to 20-year depreciation. And we're seeing roll-off Merchant investment, which tends to be more in the 10 to 15 type of cycle. So as you see that shift within the company, as we've gone to be more and more of an on-site tonnage company, you're seeing that the replacement of the depreciation, is you're seeing assets, which we don't fully depreciate at that 10- to 15-year life. And some things are going to the 15- to 20-year life.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: This is Rob Walker, on for Laurence. I guess, first question, in terms of the upside to your prior 2011 guidance. I'm just curious if you could break out what you are now expecting for the benefits from new project startups and operating leverage in Merchant, if there's any change to those prior numbers?
Paul Huck: Well, on the new project startups, most of that is in the Tonnage area, and we don't break it out by segment, Rob. But we still think we're going to see about $0.35 a share year-on-year from that. Probably, the increase in the guidance comes from the loading being better and volumes being better on the existing assets, particularly Electronics and Performance Materials.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And then a follow-up on the Electronics strength. Kind of using the rough math you laid out for Merchant incremental margins, it looks like incremental margins in that segment were 44% year-on-year. How much of that would you attribute to structural improvements and kind of, just what would a normalized margin be in that segment?
Paul Huck: You were talking about Electronics or you said...
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Yes, Electronics, just kind of taking in the volume growth year-on-year about $100 million and then our profits up about $44 million. Just kind of how much of that is structural improvement and then kind of what would a normalized incremental be in that segment?
Paul Huck: Okay, if you take a look on the margins on an incremental basis, they are probably around 40% in Electronics. On the Performance Materials end of the business, they aren't as high. It's not as capital-intense. So they tend to be closer to a 30% range for us. And then what you're also seeing year-on-year is the improvement on the cost reductions, which we've done. And the efforts for those people to save cost should increase their margins, which they've done a very good job on.
Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: And then just finally on Merchant, as we see rates increase, as you're seeing improved loading, is there potential, or I guess how do you assess the potential to start seeing sort of 2% to 3% growth in pricing in that segment?
Paul Huck: And with regard to pricing in the Merchant area, I think, if you look at the U.S. for us and where the loading is, we are not at the point where I think you're going to see real price increase. However, we are determined to get recovery of our costs. And so we are implementing surcharges in the Merchant area within the U.S. In Europe, as I've said before, prices do need to go up. It's a competitive market, obviously. But the margins, which we have there are not satisfactory, and one of the solutions to that -- it's not the only solution -- has to be that we have to get some of our customers to pay more. We got to get costs out in that area. And as you look at Asia, I think you've seen prices go up. And we would expect that to continue. Now some of the increases, which you saw this year for the first half get around the shortage of liquid argon, which have occurred. But underlying, we have seen good strong growth of about 2% or so in LOX/LIN, which is the base product in those areas, and I think that is something, which should sustain here going forward.
Operator: And Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial has the next question.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Paul, a couple of questions. One, you've met your margin goal and, obviously, you would have exceeded, had it not been for the setbacks in Merchant, and return on capital, as you say, has improved 300 basis points. Given your revenue growth that you talked about as being better than your peers going forward, what do you think some reasonable new targets are for return on capital and for operating margins? And then just a smaller question on Electronics for Simon. I understand that your largest NF3 competitor in Japan has had power availability issues, is telling customers they won't be up and running fully until October, is this leading to any spot pricing opportunities in specialty electronic materials?
Paul Huck: Okay, Don, and first regarding the goals, and we will have comments about the goals on June 9. I think they will get everyone excited. We think we have a great opportunity, as I mentioned here at the end here, both in growth and increasing return on capital for us. But you have to just stand by and come see us on June 9. Simon?
Simon Moore: All right, thanks. Good question on NF3. So, obviously, there's a lot of facilities in Japan, and this is a broader comment than just NF3, that are affected not only by any potential damage, but also by rolling power outages. SO we don't know exactly what our competitors are doing, but NF3 is a type of process where you'd have a very difficult time to run the plant if you were still experiencing rolling power outages. So we have seen increased requests for product from our customers. I would say that NF3 pricing specifically was slightly positive versus last year and also slightly positive sequentially. So some of the things we've talked about over the last few quarters about mitigating the downward pressure, we are starting to see some positive effects there. Now keep in mind, NF3 is roughly around 10% of our Electronics sales. And so while that is a flat to slightly up, we also have some of the newer products that we are pleased our customers are adopting, and we have shown them some price volume curves. So on balance, as we've said before, for the Electronics segment, we'll probably see stable pricing going forward. The other point to make about NF3 is we typically have this under contracts. Now they're not as long as the contracts in the other aspects of our business so about a year. So we're certainly honoring our contracts and we're looking to manage the price and availability with our customer relationships as best as we can.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: And Simon, where are you on NF3 utilizations, Korea running flat out and you scaled back hometown or just wondering what kind of interim volume opportunities you might have?
Simon Moore: Yes, we are running pretty high rates right now on NF3. As we continue to line out the Korea plant, as it's a new plant, we continue to look for and find ways to squeeze some more capacity out, but we're running at a pretty high operating rate right now on the two plants.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay. And then one additional question. European healthcare looked attractive for a while, but it seems obviously with fiscal pressures there that reimbursements are getting tougher. I'm just wondering whether strategically your view as to whether you should be in homecare in Europe has changed given some of those ongoing pressures? Is it going to start looking more like the U.S. used to look?
Paul Huck: With that, Don, and regarding the European healthcare, it's been a good successful business for us. There has been price pressures. That is nothing new, given the price pressures which we've been dealing with for a long time here. We matched that with reductions on costs for us, and we look at businesses and we look to make the right decisions. There aren't any sacred cows for us as far as the business, but we basically don't comment or try to speculate on this business. It's been a successful business for us.
Operator: We'll now hear from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Paul, you mentioned Tonnage would be down in Q3 sequentially due to lower bonuses. Could you quantify the impact of the bonuses in Q2 and how much down do you expect Q3 to be?
Paul Huck: As far as how much of bonuses, we don't actually comment exactly on the -- and give amounts of the bonuses. Year-to-year, the impact of bonuses is not huge, Dave. So what this is, is it's really something, which gets to be a cycle for us. And we have the peak period, as I said in the second quarter. If we look at going forward on the Tonnage segment, with the additional maintenance activity, which we're going to see, and also due to the decline in bonuses. In aggregate, we'll probably down pretty close to what our Q1 results were in that segment for us.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: And Paul, just on the backlog, the $2 billion backlog, should that be up by year end and should that be even higher in 2012 level?
Paul Huck: Yes. Yes, and that is our goal. We think that there are lots of opportunities for us. This always gets around the issue of trying to time the projects. So trying to predict the backlog is always very difficult for us. And we'll have more to say on the CapEx guidance as we get closer to 2012. But our hope is that our 2012 CapEx actually grows from 2011. That's certainly the thing, which as we look to the future, is something, which we see those opportunities for us.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Paul, lastly, on North American Merchant pricing, what does it take to get higher real pricing? Is it just higher operating rates or something else?
Paul Huck: No. For us, I think, it's that the operating rates in the business really have to go up here right now.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll now hear from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: I was wondering if you could go through in a little bit more detail exactly what the costs were that you encountered, what the operational issues were that you encountered in your Merchant business? And also address whether diesel, higher diesel prices were an impact in the quarter and kind of remind us how your surcharges work on the diesel front?
Paul Huck: Sure, okay. If you take a look at the cost, one of the things, which we looked at and the amount of what the shortfall for us was, to get to kind of the margin where our leverage would have showed up as [ph] flow-through, we were short about $15 million in profit in an estimate, which we did here. About half of that is unrecovered inflation, where we didn't get the productivity savings, which we were planning on getting for us. The remainder of that then sits in 2 other areas. The first is the cost of additional power and the variable costs to move product around from an operation standpoint. In other words, you've got a plant out in a particular place, so you got to move product to longer distances to serve the customer. We have the capacity in most products to be able to do that. So we didn't lose a lot in volume. We lost some in volume, but we didn't lose a lot. And then the additional fixed cost to fix the plants and maintain the plants and stuff like that, that was the other half of those things. Those are split about even, when you look at that. With regard to pricing overall in this segment, we about recovered the variable cost increases, which we saw year-on-year for those things. So pricing, we can pick on certain areas in certain regions. But on net, overall, it looked good. There is opportunity for us to increase margins with the pricing as I covered before, particularly in places like Europe and in some of the recovery areas of some of the cost. With regard to the surcharges on diesel costs and things like that, diesel was not a huge issue for us in this quarter, as I said. But our surcharges typically will go on the way they lag, by a month or so for us before we can get that out to the customer. And it varies contract by contract.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: All right, thanks. And then in the discussion of Electronics margin, it seem to be that you omitted mentioning that pricing went positive there for the first time in a couple of years. I was wondering if that was a component of the margin improvement as well. Is demand strong enough that we're going to continue to see positive pricing into the second half of FY '11. And is it primarily market-driven or are some of the restructuring and internal changes that you guys have made also an important factor in getting pricing positive in Electronics?
Paul Huck: As far as the pricing, I'm going to put that to Simon, because he ran the business in which you're talking about the pricing for things. If you look at this, if you look at this overall from a margin standpoint, pricing has typically been a big drag for us on margin. It isn't a drag anymore on margin for us. But the big factors for us, which you've seen this, have been the two factors that we talked about are volume and the efforts, which we've done to really get real sustainable productivity gains across this segment. But Simon, why don't you take the answer on pricing there?
Simon Moore: A good point. And then again just a couple of things, we said on the Performance Materials side, we were successful with the price increases we took out recovering additional costs on the Performance Materials side. So good work by the team there. On the Electronics side, we said that the Specialty Materials, and obviously, as Paul said historically that's the area that has the most variability and has had the most downward pressure. That was flat versus last year and basically flat versus last quarter in Specialty Materials. So that's a big change from the historical direction that this business has been taking. I gave you a little bit more color specifically on NF3. But again, we have a suite of products in this area, and I think we'd say, stable pricing going forward as we continue to drive productivity, allows us the opportunity to expand margins.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: All right. And then last question for you Paul is, what was the diluted share counts as of the end of the quarter? And have you done any additional share repurchases since you announced the $350 million in mid-March?
Paul Huck: And we have not done any additional repurchases of shares since then. Let me just get you the diluted share count. I gotta look at that.
Simon Moore: So we're on the same page here, Mike. We're talking about the average for the quarter, right? Because that's the number that actually gets used, right? So at the end of Q2, that was 218.8. That was down a little bit from the end of Q1. The share purchases we did were primarily in the second half of the quarter. So you'll see maybe about a third of that effect in this quarter, and you'll see the full effect of that in the next quarter.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: I guess that's what I'm trying to get to, is kind of what's a good number to use for next quarter for the diluted share count?
Simon Moore: As Paul said, we bought back about 3.8 million shares. We do have, as you know, the option exercises do continue to expand those number of shares as well. So again, I think we'd see about 2/3 more than we saw in this last quarter.
Paul Huck: If you look at that, I think, Mike, a good number to use will be maybe about $217 million -- $217.7 million to $217.8 million, right around there, when you just take the number. So down by 1 million shares or so.
Operator: And we'll now move to our next question that will come from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: In terms of oil moving up here to these levels. Has that helped the Base Refinery Hydrogen business and any thoughts on -- is projects in oil sands or other areas potentially could pick up for you?
Paul Huck: Yes. And with the increase in oil prices, I think, if the increase in oil prices is sustained, I think it helps the oil sands. So I think that it makes it more attractive. It makes the economics work better for us. And with regard to the Refinery Hydrogen business, we do not see that respond to oil prices on the spot basis.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay. In terms of 2012, I know it's a little bit early, but can you help us understand the momentum that you see in terms of, let's say, new Tonnage projects coming onstream? You still have operating rates at levels that could continue to improve and maybe the potential for Electronics to continue to improve?
Paul Huck: Yes. I think you outlined a lot of the things which we do until... We'll talk more about this at the investor conference, as we talk about our goals going forward. But I think we are very excited about continued strong improvement in 2012. We've got -- we still have loading, which we can do. We've got projects, which are coming onstream, projects from this year get the full-year effect. We'll have projects coming onstream in 2012, also, for us. And we think that sustains out into the future.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay, great. One last quick question, in terms of North American, Europe volumes, do you see them accelerating into the second half of the year or sort of staying. In these low single-digit levels?
Paul Huck: I think as far as the gains in volumes in Europe, I think those -- we are pleased with those. I think the gains in the U.S., I think we would expect to start seeing them accelerating.
Operator: Mark Gulley with Soleil Securities has the next question.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: A lot of talk about U.S. Merchant today. With the low operating rates in the low 70s, would one of the opportunities to improve margin and productivity be to shut down some of your oldest, least efficient plants to raise margins there?
Paul Huck: Yes, Mark, I think one of the things in which you can be assured of is that we look at and run our plants to give the best margin to us in the near term. We can certainly do that and do that all the time. I think as we go forward and look at this, we think there is still growth, which occurs here. And so that's something, which we can take advantage of here, and we think we have the opportunity to load.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: Well, as a follow up, if your operating rates are, let's say, in the low 70s and let's say you want to aim for, I'll just a pick number, the 85 to 90 area, it would take years to get there, given your volume growth rates. So am I missing something in terms of the opportunity for capacity declines?
Paul Huck: It depends on what you see those opportunities in the U.S. being. I mean, we still see a fairly decent growth within the U.S. from a manufacturing standpoint. So we're predicting the growth rates in the manufacturing end to be 5% or so going forward in the future. And if we get a multiple of that, we ought to be there. We ought to be up higher in operating rates.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: Okay. And then in your concluding remarks, you talked about some of the growth opportunities and you talked about the fact that you have enjoyed some very good volume growth historically. Without giving away your Investor Day, can you kind of highlight for '12 the opportunities for volume growth that you're most excited about?
Paul Huck: You're right, Mark, I'm not going to give the Investor Day because I want everyone to come for this, because we think we've got a good story for people and it's worth coming to. But if you look at those opportunities for us, and these will be even longer term, as we look at the emerging markets, we certainly see great opportunities and we're very happy with our position, both from a Merchant and on-site business in these emerging markets, and the product offerings, which we have, and the applications, which we have to serve those markets. I think you'll be excited by those things going forward here. And then, obviously, also the improvements of returns for us, which we've been working very hard at, and we continue to focus on.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks. Paul, I think you mentioned that you believe your portfolio, the Asian exposure of Electronics, et cetera, gives you a more attractive opportunity for investors. Have you considered, over the long term, sizing that? How much faster do you think you can grow than the gases market?
Paul Huck: Sure, and if you come to the Investor Day we'll have some things, and we will talk to you about that very opportunity.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Can you tempt me more specifically now?
Paul Huck: As far as that is concerned, sure. We think that overall, from those things, we can grow faster than our investors by 1% or 2%.
Simon Moore: Sustained, which is a lot when you look at that.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I would encourage you to have some data behind that, because I think generally investors don't share that perception. So I think that would be pretty...
Paul Huck: I agree with that.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Moore for any closing comments.

[Operator Instructions] Also, this teleconference presentation and the comments on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Nelson Squires: Thank you, John. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' First Quarter 2011 Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck and I will review our fiscal Q1 results and outlook for the remainder of 2011. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing a replay of this call, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern time, are also available on the website. Please turn to Slides 2 and 3. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials
Paul Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide #4.  We are off to a great start to fiscal 2011. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year on growth in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments. Underlying sales increased 11% on 10% higher volumes and 1% higher pricing. Sequentially, sales were higher 2%. Underlying sales were up 1% on higher pricing in Merchant Gases and our Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Volumes were flat mainly due to seasonality. Operating income of $404 million increased 17% from prior year on higher volumes. Our operating margin improved to 16.9%, up 100 basis points versus prior year. We are on track to deliver on our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. Equity affiliate income was up slightly versus prior year. Improved volumes and cost performance were partially offset by a charge for the anticipated sale of a plant in one of our affiliates. Absent this loss, sequential equity affiliate income would have been slightly higher.  As we've seen in prior years, our tax rate in quarter one was lower than our expected average rate for the full year due to the timing of certain tax credits and adjustments. We still expect our full year tax rate to be consistent with the 25% and 26% guidance range given last quarter. For the quarter, net income increased 17% and, diluted earnings per share increased by 16%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed for the quarter improved to 13.2%, up 140 basis points. Turning to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19. Higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments increased earnings per share by $0.25, year-on-year. The impact of pricing, combined with energy and raw material costs, netted to zero. Costs were $0.02 unfavorable as our productivity gains were more than offset by higher operating and distribution costs. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.02 unfavorable impact. And higher non-controlling interest and shares outstanding cost us $0.01 each. In summary, a very good start to the year at the top end of our expectations.  Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 6, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases sales of $988 million were up 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 8% on increased volumes and higher pricing. Currency reduced sales by 2%. Year-on-year sales improvement was driven by very strong Asia growth and improving volumes in North America and Europe liquid bulk products. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were up 1%.  Merchant Gases operating income of $201 million was up 6% versus prior year and up 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 20.3% was flat versus prior year and up 80 basis points sequentially. Sequential margins expanded driven by improved pricing across all regions. During the quarter, we announced the construction of four new projects in India through our INOX Air Products joint venture. Three new merchant air separation units will provide efficient and reliable supply for the strong growth opportunities we are seeing in India. The fourth project will be a piggyback ASU and hydrogen plant to supply gasses to Saint Gobain Glass India and liquid products for the merchant market. These investments strengthen INOX's Air Products' leading merchant presence throughout India. Also during the quarter, we brought China's first air separation unit utilizing LNG cold energy on stream. This JV with CNOOC, the China National Offshore Oil Company (sic) [Corporation] will provide a low-cost supply of over 600 tons of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to supply the fast-growing industrial gases market in Fujian Province.  Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In North America, sales improved 6% versus prior year, the largest increase we have seen in over two years. Volumes were up 3% on growth and liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon. Pricing was up 3% with increases across the portfolio. This was the highest increase in the last seven quarters. LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the mid-70s.  In Europe, underlying sales increased 2%, but negative 6% currency reduced overall sales to a negative 4%. Volumes were up 3% with stronger liquid bulk growth tempered by modest packaged gas improvement and lower healthcare volumes. Pricing was down 1% with positive packaged gas pricing, offset by unfavorable healthcare and liquid bulk pricing. Our Europe LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s.  In Asia, sales were up 35% versus last year, with underlying sales up 30%. Volumes were up 25% with strength across all products. Pricing was also strong, up 5%. Pricing was stronger in part due to spot argon in China, as rolling power curtailments reduced steel companies' self-generated argon. LOX/LIN pricing across Asia was up 2%. These sales and volume increases were the highest in over four years. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We will continue to bring new capacity onstream over the next few quarters. Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $766 million increased 10% versus last year with volumes up 12%. Higher volumes came from loading existing assets and new plants brought onstream in the last year. Sequentially, sales were up 2% with volumes up 5% and energy and raw material pass-through decreasing sales by 4%. Volume growth was driven by new plants.  Operating income of $116 million was up 15% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups, reduced maintenance costs and improved plant efficiency. Operating margin of 15.1% increased 70 basis points versus prior year due to the lower costs mentioned previously and lower natural gas costs pass-through. Sequentially, operating income was down 1%, and margins declined due to higher maintenance costs.  Earlier in the quarter, we announced that our Heartland Hydrogen Pipeline in Alberta, Canada, has been commercialized. And we announced two new pipeline hydrogen supply contracts with Dow Chemical Canada and Evonik Degussa Canada. We also announced a new nitrogen plant of the Isle of Grain LNG terminal in the United Kingdom. This is our third plant to the facility and will support the expansion of the terminal having the capacity to process the equivalent of 20% of Britain's natural gas demand. Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $526 million were up 21% compared to last year on volume increases with flat pricing. Sequentially, sales were up slightly on positive pricing and slightly lower seasonal volumes. Electronics sales were up 30% compared to last year and up 4% sequentially, as the industry pushed well beyond 2008 peak production. We also saw less seasonal decline, particularly at our industry-leading customers. Electronics specialty materials sales increased 13% versus prior year and were down 1% sequentially. Ongoing Tonnage sales were up 16% versus prior year and up 7% sequentially. And our Equipment business was up significantly versus prior year and also up versus prior quarter. Electronics specialty materials pricing was flat sequentially. Performance Materials sales increased 11% versus last year with strength across all markets. Sales were down 4% sequentially due to normal seasonality. Segment operating income of $69 million was up 42% versus prior year due to volume leverage and the benefit of the 2010 electronics restructuring actions. Income was down 18% sequentially due to volume seasonality and an inventory revaluation. Margins improved 190 basis points from last year due to higher volumes and lower costs. They were down sequentially due to seasonally lower volumes and the inventory revaluation. We are on track to deliver the 15% target margin for the segment for FY '11.  In terms of new business, in December, we announced the new air separation unit and pipeline at the Tanjeong, Korea site to supply Samsung Mobile Display's newest Active-matrix Organic LED fab. Earlier in January, we announced the supply of nitrogen and bulk gases to UMC's new fab 12 phase 3 and 4 in the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan. And just last week, we announced the formation of our production joint venture to produce high-purity anhydrous hydrochloric acid in Freeport, Texas. Air Products will market our share of the output from this facility, which will provide a reliable supply of HCL, primarily for our Electronics customers. Please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $112 million were up 3% versus prior year and down 13% sequentially, reflecting lower ASU activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity. Income was flat sequentially. Our backlog is lower both versus prior year and sequentially, but it is expected to improve by the end of the year.  Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Simon. Now if you please turn to Slide 11, I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook.  Our guidance for quarter two is for earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.40 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant onstreams, including the Weihe Clean Energy Gasifier project and the Xingtai Steel will add to next quarter's results. We also expect the global manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery. And equity affiliate income should be higher.  Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Asia, we expect some slowing around the Lunar New Year holidays, and we anticipate a higher tax rate in quarter two. For fiscal year 2011, the underlying assumptions that we shared on last quarter's call remain unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance also remains unchanged at $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, up from last year's $1.3 billion. With one quarter completed, we're raising the lower end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05, revising our full-year guidance range to $5.55 to $5.70 a share.  Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. On December 9, we announced our best and final offer of $70 per share. As we stated in that announcement, it is time to bring this matter to a conclusion. We are disappointed that the Airgas board continues to ignore the will of its shareholders. Airgas shareholders deserve the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want to accept our $0.70 per share in cash offer.  Now let me wrap up. We are off to a great start in fiscal 2011, with growing sales and earnings. We also continue to make significant improvements in our operating margin and our return on capital. We remain committed to delivering returns for our shareholders that will make us the best investment in the industry. The whole team at Air Products is excited by our opportunities and is focused on driving increasing shareholder value in the future.  Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to John to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John McNulty. [Credit Suisse]
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: First on the Electronics business, clearly the volumes were really solid especially for the seasonality. Can you kind of walk us through maybe what some of the drivers are behind that? And how we should think about that going forward, if there was maybe some inventory-related issues or anything like that that may have driven them a little higher than normal?
Paul Huck: Yes, John. I don't think that there was anything on the inventory side which played a factor. I think as we look at this and we look at the Electronics business, we've said this before, is that coming out of the recession, people preferentially spent their money on consumer electronics. And so if people had an extra $200, $500, $1,000 to spend, that money more often found its way into the consumer electronics area than it found its way into other markets. Also being helped are some of the new devices. The success of the iPhone during this time period, the success of the iPad, tablet computers has driven a lot of that. I think the other thing which has proven to be a good thing is that the large-screen TVs, the LCD TVs continue to sell well. They sold very well at Christmas. There were a lot of concerns with people about what sort of things would happen. Was there too much inventory, too much production capacity? We have not seen that. We've seen our customers run very well throughout that, a good back-to-school season, a good holiday season. All that said, there's always going to be some slowing. And there was some slowing for us. The growth sequentially was not as strong as it had been in other quarters. And we would expect, as I said, in the Lunar New Year impact will have a small impact on us there, too, in the quarter, two, but a very solid market. Inventories appear to be in line very well. Customers seem to be operating extremely well, and we're seeing expansions. We're seeing new orders. You saw the announcements which Simon talked about here.
Simon Moore: Maybe I could just add to it. Very good comments, Paul. I think, particularly, for our customers, where we're pleased to have key positions with the industry leaders, their utilization rates were strong through the period and are forecasted to continue to be strong into the future.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: The inventory revaluation that you saw in the Electronics and Performance segment, can you quantify what that was and how we should think about that going forward if there's any further adjustments to be made?
Paul Huck: I want to talk about that. That's a good question here for you and for me to go through this. It involves the accounting and the way you account for inventory for us. First off, one of the things which you want to understand is that overall to the company, the impact of this was about zero. So it was not a negative impact for us as the company is concerned, right? In quarter one, what happens is we take our standards and we change our standards. So we take the value which we put to the inventory on 30 September, and we go out and we adjust it to a new value which we're going to use for standard cost in fiscal year '11. For products which are on LIFO, we're going to reverse that at corporate, that impact. So if you write the standard up, you get a gain. If you write the standard down, you get a loss on that. And what we had in Electronics and Performance Materials area is we had a loss. That probably cost us about 100 basis points in margin overall in that segment for us, so if you're looking at the ongoing impact. But actually, what you're not going to see, going forward, is you're not going to see that impact anymore. So it happened. It's a one-time adjustment. And now the cost going through the P&L will be at the lower standard, so it should have the impact of raising margins for us.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Jeff Zekauskas. [JPMorgan Chase & Co]
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: You talked about the strength in your Asian Merchant business. Was that across the board in Asia? Or were there particular areas of strength and weakness by geography or sub-geography?
Simon Moore: Yes, it's a good question. I think to highlight that, very significant volume growth in Asia, but also positive pricing. We've talked about positive pricing across Asia the last couple of quarters. We did mention that some of that positive was from some spot argon. But even outside of that, the base pricing was very positive. And that was generally fairly consistent across the regions in Asia. Again, our strong positions in Korea and Taiwan, with the strength of the electronics market, a lot of the merchant products go into electronics there. And certainly, China's economy continues to provide good opportunities for us.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then lastly, what was your backlog in Equipment and Energy as of the end of the quarter?
Paul Huck: It was on the slide there. It's a little over $200 million.
Operator: Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Begleiter. [Deutsche Bank]
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Paul, in Merchant North America, it looks like volume growth is moderating. Can you talk to those trends and what you expect going forward from a volume growth perspective, year-over-year?
Paul Huck: Sure, Dave. One of the things which you see in the business here within the U.S. is that you see the economic growth is moderating also. So in 2010 in fiscal year for us, we saw an economy within the U.S. which probably grew around 5% on the manufacturing side. We're predicting growth of 3% to 4% in 2011. And the reason why it grew stronger in 2010 was that the inventory pipeline refilled during that time period. But you've seen it -- another example of an industry which has seen some of those is on the steel industry. Steel industry rebuilt their pipeline and then they brought their operating rates back down. So as we look forward, our basic assumptions of a long, slow recovery in manufacturing seems to be holding well. Everyone, I think, was hoping for more of a V-shape. We did not see a V. We did see some inventory rebuild in 2010. But as far as the dynamics in the U.S. economy, we're still dealing with a high unemployment; consumer confidence, which is getting better, albeit it still isn't great with things. And so everyone is doing what I think is the right thing, including us, watching our costs, paying attention to it, going after the business, at which we're advantaged and which we have opportunities for in the future. But as far as a very strong recovery within the United States, I just don't think it's in the cards until consumer confidence and employment get a lot better for us. We have too much of our economy on the consumer end of things. All that said, I don't see it a double-dip either. So I see long, good, steady, solid growth going forward here for the economy.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: And, Paul, just on your large project backlog, you've had a number of announcement wins in the last few months. Could you talk to the size of the backlog and the impact on earnings growth in the next two years?
Paul Huck: Yes. If we look at the size of the backlog right now, it's probably around $1.8 billion or so for us. Capital spending, as we've talked about it, is going to be $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in 2011. We probably see that also, hopefully, growing in 2012. That's going to depend upon awards which occur in 2011. But there's a number of projects which are out there, especially in countries like China, where production capacity does need to expand for us. So we're very excited about those opportunities. As far as impact on earnings for this year, as we talked about it last quarter, probably $0.30 to $0.40 a share, as far as the onstreams in this year and in last year. A little early to tell what the impact for 2012 is going to be, but I wouldn't expect it to be a lot changed from that.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: That $1.8 billion is up versus last year? And if so, how much?
Paul Huck: The $1.8 billion? It's pretty close to about the same, about pretty close to about the same.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question from Laurence Alexander. [Jefferies & Company.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: First, as you think about your longer-term margins in the Tonnage business, how much of a gap to get to your long-term margin targets would be just volume recovery? So better loading on the assets as opposed to benefits from higher energy prices? And I guess the second question is, are you seeing any change in customer order patterns or urgency as they discuss potential tonnage contracts, given how energy prices have escalated?
Paul Huck: I'll answer question two first, because I guess it's probably a little easier for us. As far as the order patterns are concerned, we have not seen that. There's still a lot of bids which need to be decided and awards which should happen. We would expect that in 2011, that award activity, it will pick up in the industry because of those factors, because of the energy. I think as uncertainty starts to come out of the economy, I think that's also something which is actually important. So as people grow less concerned with a double-dip, both here in the United States or Europe or worldwide, order patterns and demand, people will get more confident around that. So I think that leads to improving orders in 2011 for things. If you take a look at the tonnage operating margins, one of the things which we've talked about for a long time is we invest in this business on return and not upon margin of the business. The margin of the business is impacted by a number of factors. First off on the hydrogen end, a hydrogen plant with the same type of contract as an oxygen plant is going to have a lower margin in this business because what happens is the energy passes through and then the cost of the gas is higher. Whether it's a hydrogen plant or an oxygen plant, we make our money by investing money in these plants and running them well for our customers and building them well and good operations and getting efficiencies in the future. We don't care. And so we try not to establish, really, targets. All that said, higher margins are better with those things. And so what we try to pay attention to is the efficiencies of the plants and how we're doing there. And so with the efficiencies of the plants, that is something which we have made good and steady progress on. It's helped in the margins of this business over time and improved things for us with things. But we don't actually set a margin target is the important thing which you have to understand, Laurence. And so we do try to drive the efficiencies and the returns higher. And that's is what is occurring in the business for us as we go forward here.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question from P.J. Juvekar. [Citigroup]
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: You mentioned that in U.S. margin, you're operating rate is mid-70s; and in Europe, they're mid-80s. I was wondering what's the difference if U.S. is seeing a slightly better recovery than Europe? Is it just that there's too much overcapacity in the U.S.?
Paul Huck: If you take a look at the capacity within the U.S., it's certainly offloaded a lot during the downturn. Prices have held well during that time period. So if you look at the way in which we ourselves and our competitors have gone out and worked through on the business, I think we've operated our plants well. We've paid attention to what's happening in our contracts and what's happening to our costs in this business. So I think within the U.S., the business is operating very well. Remember, the U.S. is spread out a lot with things. And Europe tends to be concentrated more. Around the plants, it's just not as big a land area to deal with in that area. And so as far as our concerns are here, we think the U.S. is in fine shape. There's lots of loading capacity and loading of the capacity to occur. We think that offers a great opportunity for us to grow earnings and grow returns within the U.S. Within Europe, I believe we need to get some of our prices higher with our customers. We would like to see the margins in our European business better and the returns better for us. And I think a market which is tighter actually helps us in that vein.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: And the second question on margin was on India. You're building four new plants, three margin and one piggyback. Is there risk that there is overbuild of margin capacity in India, similar to what happened in China a few years ago?
Simon Moore: That's a great question, P.J. And certainly, in an emerging market where you have increasing demand and increasing capacity, that's something to keep an eye on. I think one of the key points is the three plants -- first of all, the on-site plant we're building for the glass company, we have a strong base load with a Tonnage customer and we add some merchant capacity. The other three facilities are in newer and emerging areas around India, where we see the market growth continuing and we're excited about creating first mover advantages in those geographies as the manufacturing economy in those areas continues to grow. So we have done some good work with our marketing teams there to understand what's there, but truly that first mover advantage of those three plants, which are fairly diverse geographically, we think will bring loading to those facilities over time. So a good question, but these projects, we're confident, will load up over time.
Paul Huck: I think the other thing, P.J., and just to add to what Simon says, is that we have developed a package plant here in this business, which we take and we put in. It is not a very large plant for us. It's about 200 tons a day. And it enables us to go out and to get it into the market early. It's a good efficient cycle for us and gives us a real advantage in moving in to those without creating a huge, large plant to throw down in the area and produce a lot of extra capacity.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: And just quickly on that, what kind of hurdle rate do you use for a Merchant client in the emerging markets?
Paul Huck: It's certainly higher than the rate which we use for one within the United States or Europe because there's obviously more risk associated with that. So we earn a higher return because we're taking a lot more risk in those areas, obviously.
Jeffrey Germanotta - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: That's fair but can you throw us a range?
Paul Huck: I'm not going to give you a number. But if you just think about that, if you take a look at the country in which we're operating in the emerging markets, typically, the cost of capital in those countries is anywhere from 200, 300-plus points higher than within the United States. And then we look to earn a higher return on that, a higher spread because the risk of the loading of those plants is greater.
Operator: We'll now move on to our next question from Mark Gulley. [Soleil securities]
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: First of all, with respect to the microelectronics industry, can you update us, Simon, on what your outlook now is for squariing the silicon prices. I believe the last quarter it was just 5% to 10%, which seems to be pretty modest now that we've seen your results in this quarter and everything that Paul talked about in terms of some of the new product cycles that are going on?
Simon Moore: Good question, Mark. So we did provide a forecast of 5% to 10% MSI growth last quarter. Quite frankly, we'd say we still see things in that range. I think one of the dynamics, quite frankly, we see is that our leadership position with the industry leaders perhaps allow us to mitigate some of the seasonality that the industry might have seen. So I think that's consistent with our forecast going forward at this point.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: I guess I would have thought that if you're well positioned with industry leaders, and if they're leaders, that they would pull that number higher, but I guess you're just not willing to go there quite yet?
Simon Moore: Well, again, quite frankly, I think there's -- it's not just our view. Obviously, there's a lot of perspective on where the electronics industry is going. We think that's fairly consistent with other forecasts that are out there. So we feel pretty good about that guidance we gave last quarter.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: And then with respect to Merchant prices in Europe, given the higher operating rates, and given higher power rates, I'm a little surprised that you're not able to get the price increases that you're getting elsewhere in Asia and in the U.S. Any thoughts on why the European pricing structure just won't move?
Paul Huck: We have actually seen it move in the past. So we would expect it to be effective here going forward in the future here.
Simon Moore: Just a quick note, add on that that. Actually, sequentially Europe pricing was slightly positive, Mark.
Operator: And our next question comes from Don Carson. [Susquehanna Financial Group]
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Two questions, one on the tonnage front, you talked about the potential for signing some new business. I'm just wondering if you can outline where that new business might be? I know you've signed some contracts for hydrogen in Alberta. There's talk of reviving some oil sands projects like Fort Hills. Is that an area of increased opportunity for you?
Paul Huck: As far as the oil sands, Don, we would not expect to see an order any time within the next year or so probably with that, and given what's happening in those areas. But if you take a look at the on-site area for us and where we are, and looking for activities, we continue to pursue jobs within China, certainly, is the area of the largest activity, but also within the U.S., the Middle East are also areas of activity for us, too.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: A follow-up on Merchant. I mean, again, you got relatively low operating rates, you said, but you're still getting price at 3%. Is this price a true increase in price or is it really cost recovery? And specifically can you talk about the trends in pricing on your new business signings in North American Merchant? Are they higher than your existing book?
Paul Huck: If you take a look at the signings, the signing activity is very competitive. And so in general, on the new business, which is coming in, the prices are lower for us. If you take a look at the price increases, a lot of that is driven by cost for us and trying to recover cost at this point in time.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: So that suggests that this 3% isn't sustainable or it's only sustainable to the extent that you think costs continue to go up and you try and recover them? So essentially, real pricing isn't increasing then, is it?
Paul Huck: What happens, Don, is that in this market at the loadings, we're able to maintain our margins very well. So that is the good news. We have taken actions on cost, taking action to recover costs, principally our cost as power has gone up, as fuel has gone. We've been able to do a good job of being able to recover those costs. We will continue to do that. I think that's a very positive sign for us going out and looking at -- in trying to take a look at the future for us. So I think the price situation within the U.S. is in good shape and being managed well.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: You talked about margins in Merchants, so as you get additional volume growth there, what kind of incremental margins would you get compared to your average margin at 20.3%?
Paul Huck: We're still looking at probably about a 35% average incremental margin on that business.
Operator: And we'll move on to our next question with Mike Harrison. [First Analysis]
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation: I have sort of a different question on the Merchant business in Europe. I was wondering if you could talk about how the Packaged Gas business there has been trending? Are you seeing any signs of improvement and what's been going on with pricing on the package side in Europe?
Paul Huck: As far as the business on price, and we have gotten some price increases in that business. Once again, we're trying out there very much to recover our costs, as steel costs and things like that go up. On the volume side, the volumes of that business are still depressed for us and are flat at best at this point in time.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation: And in the Tonnage business, I was wondering if you're seeing any of your customers, and this is globally, any of your customers operating at rates that are high enough that we might see some operating bonuses this year?
Paul Huck: I think, yes. And we saw some in 2010 also, operating bonuses. The operating bonuses really depend upon the operations of their products, not so much the operations of the base, on the volume of our customers. It really depends upon how well the availability of our plants and the reliability of our plants is.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation: If I could ask one more on the Electronics and Performance Materials business, the margin there, you said may be 100 basis points of headwind related to this inventory revaluation. We still saw then about 200 basis points of margin pressure, quarter-on-quarter, despite an increase in the top line. And I think it probably bears maybe some further color, if you guys could provide it?
Paul Huck: Sure. On the inventory impact, obviously there. And then when you look at this, if you take a look at the drop in the Performance Materials sales and what we saw. And volume decline in the area drove a good portion of those changes there, too, for us. So it was related to the mix of the products in which we go through there.
Operator: And moving on, we'll take Kevin McCarthy. [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]
Kevin McCarthy: With regard to the Merchant Gases business in Asia, your volume there accelerated more than twofold to 25% from 11% in the fiscal fourth quarter. Were there any competitor outages or other extraordinary issues that would have boosted that number? Or would you consider it a representative underlying rate?
Simon Moore: Good question, Kevin. No, we didn't have any special filling in for competitors or anything like that. Again, kind of a little bit more on the price side. We did mention some of the spot argon opportunities that we had. But the underlying consistent growth rate was very strong.
Kevin McCarthy: And I guess to follow-up on the pricing side in Asia. You mentioned LOX/LIN underlying would've been plus two versus the plus five that you reported for the region. Is argon structurally tight? Or was that boost more transitory in nature, such that you'll likely regress to the low-single digits in coming quarters?
Simon Moore: SO again, this was more driven by some of the rolling power outages imposed in China. We see those kind of have tailed off now, so we wouldn't necessarily see that argon spot opportunity again. Though I think we are extremely pleased by the base increases, whether they be 2%, 3%, something like that. In a high-growth region like Asia, being able to deliver real pricing improvement is a great job by the team out there.
Kevin McCarthy: And then lastly, Paul, on the project pipeline with regard to the $1.8 billion size. Could you just comment on the average returns that you're seeing? Are they flat, up or down in any meaningful way as you see the activity roll through?
Paul Huck: Yes, and the returns on average have stayed about the same for us, if I look at that on an IRR type of return.
Operator: We'll move on to our next question with Edward Yang. [Oppenheimer & Co.]
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Air Products has always been overweight, the energy sector, relative to some of its competitors and oil prices are moving back up. Do you have an update in terms of what your total exposure to the energy sector is at this point?
Paul Huck: If you take a look at that, if you take a look at it from the business which Air Products has, we have -- probably about 25% of our sales go into that area.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And on Electronics, again, you mentioned that the impact on segment margins from the inventory revaluation was 100 basis points, but the effect on the total company was zero. We'd just like some clarification on that.
Paul Huck: If you take a look at that, the other places which happened is that in the other areas, there were some small gains and then there is an offset in corporate which occurs.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And finally on Electronics and Performance Materials, pricing was flat this quarter. And in the last four quarters or so, it's been consistently negative. So is that your expectation, going forward, that price should be a positive contributor, going forward, in that business?
Paul Huck: What we would expect is that price is not going to be a large factor going forward in the business for us, either positive, either up or down right now, which is obviously, very good news, given the things which have occurred in our history here.
Simon Moore: I think we see perhaps a moderating of the downward pressure in the Electronics, particularly in the Specialty Materials business. And so as Paul said, we think that that would be stable going forward as opposed to the declines we have seen.
Operator: And we'll move on to the next question from Bob Koort.
Brian Maguire: This is Brian Maguire on for Bob. Just a question on Slide 5 of the deck, I think it's the EPS bridge from last year to this year. I think there was about $0.02 headwind from costs. I'm just wondering if you could just dive into some of the components of that? And maybe talk about what the impact of higher compensation or higher pension would have been in the quarter? Or what your assumptions are for the full year?
Paul Huck: Certainly, Brian. First off, I mean as far as on the cost for $0.02, one of the things which you have to consider is we have a $0.25 gain in volume and only $0.02 up in costs. The volume one is done at the contribution margins. So this is all of the fixed costs, which we had, all the drivers and stuff like that. So we're very happy with that sort of performance for us.
Brian Maguire: And then just one last one on Equipment and Energy, obviously a big jump in margins there. Part of that was just the year-over-year comp. I wanted to get a sense of how sustainable that rate of growth is as we go a little bit further in 2011?
Paul Huck: In that area, I think -- and we've talked about this before, is that we sell two perpetual products in that area: the LNG heat exchangers, where 100% of what we supply is value-added, which is the present design; and the exchanger which is manufactured by Air Products. So the margins in that business are higher than in the Air Separation business, where we buy in a lot of the equipment and purchase equipment. We purchase compressors, heat exchangers, et cetera for the customers and bring that. So as a percent of sales, the margin just is not as high in that business. And so the margin for that business drops, moves around a lot. We're very pleased by the growth year-to-year in that business for us. We think that's a good sign for us. LNG has driven that growth as the mix has shifted more to LNG in this past year.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: So it's a mix issue more than anything else?
Paul Huck: It is, yes. It is a mix issue.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: And that could have the potential to continue for...
Paul Huck: Yes, that's right. And the margins for the bulk of 2011, given the backlog which we have, is LNG is going to be a strong growth driver throughout 2011 on the profits. Then if we get more orders in the Air Separation area, that will take margins down. But we look at this, it will also contribute profits in this business. We don't have a lot of capital invested. And we get payments in advance, so it's a self-financing business. And so as we look at this, it's something in which we look at it on a project-by-project basis as far as accepting or bidding on jobs.
Operator: Moving on we'll take our next question from David Manthey. [Robert W. Baird]
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Of the 12% volume growth in the Tonnage business, can you tell us approximately how much this quarter was due to new plant startups on that growth rate? And then if you could tell us about 2011 based on the pipeline if you have an approximation of what might be additive to growth?
Paul Huck: Yes. If we take a look at 2011 for us, we probably think about half of the growth overall is going to come from that. And that's what we saw in Q1.
Operator: At this time, we have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Moore for any additional or closing remarks.
Simon Moore: Thanks, John, and to everybody who joined us on the call today. Please go to the website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00 p.m. today. Again, thank you for joining us and have a nice day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

===== 2010 Q4  (2010-10-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products & Chemicals Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Mr. Simon Moore, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Moore, you may begin.
Simon Moore: Thank you, James. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' Fourth Quarter Earnings Teleconference. This is Simon Moore. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I, will review our fiscal 2010 results and outlook for fiscal 2011. We issued our earnings release this morning. It is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to www.airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time are also available on the website. Please turn to Slides 2 and 3. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the information on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release explaining factors that may affect these expectations. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul for a review of our financials.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide #4. Before we look at this quarter's results, I would like to spend a few moments looking back over these past two years. They had been quite a journey. This slide show the progress we have made at improving two key financial metrics, operating margin and return on capital, employed. If you take a look at the left side of this slide, you'll see the improvements that we made over the four-year period before the recession. We had moved our operating margin up by more than 1.5%, and we improved our after-tax return on capital to 13% by the end of 2008. In the middle of this slide, you can see the impact of the global recession on our fiscal 2009 results. During that time, we took a number of significant actions to lower our costs and position ourselves for success coming out of the recession. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see our 2010 results, which show the improvements we have made, the impact of the actions we took and the sequential progress we are continuing to make. Our operating margin in this last quarter improved to 17.1% and to 16.5% for the full year, as we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2011 goal of 17%. More importantly, we continued to drive our return on capital employed higher. We are already back to our prior peak despite operating rates being lower, and we have kept our return on capital well above our cost of capital across this last business cycle. Our focus on putting in place a low-cost structure makes us more competitive and positions us to grow faster with higher returns. Turning to Slide #5 for a review of fiscal year 2010. Sales of $9 billion increased 9%. Our underlying sales grew 8%, with volumes up 9%. We delivered strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. This was driven by a significant recovery in our Electronics and Performance Materials segments and new investments and contracts in our Tonnage Gasses segment. Operating income of $1.5 billion grew 25% on better performance across all business segments. Our operating margin for the year averaged 16.5%, an improvement of more than the 2%, reflecting solid productivity and strong operating leverage. This is the highest operating margin in more than a decade. Looking forward, margins should continue to expand. We still have operating leverage available, and we remain committed to driving further cost reduction. For the year, earnings per share increased 24%, and our annual return on capital employed improved to 12.4%, almost 2% higher than last year. In summary, we delivered significant improvements in 2010, some examples are: We completed our global cost-reduction actions and the Electronics business platform renewal; we repositioned our manufacturing centers; continued to leverage SAP; and further utilized our shared services centers. All of these actions contributed to increased productivity to the bottom line. Finally, we increased our dividends for the 28th consecutive year, as we made significant improvements in both our operating and free cash flow this year. Please turn to Slide 6. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 8% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage Gases and Merchant Gases segments. Sequentially, sales grew 4%. Underlying sales were up 3% on volume growth across all business segments. Operating income of $402 million increased 22% from prior year due to higher volumes. Operating income was up 7% versus prior quarter, mainly due to improved Electronics and Performance Materials results. Our operating margin improved to 17.1%, up 170 basis points versus prior year and 50 basis points sequentially. We remain on track to deliver our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 19% and diluted earnings per share increased 18%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved on an instantaneous or run rate basis to 13.2%, up almost 2%. Turning to Slide 7 for a review of the factors that affected of the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.21. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments helped to increase earnings per share by $0.28 year-on-year. Pricing, energy and raw materials together were unfavorable, subtracting $0.06. Costs were $0.04 favorable, as our productivity gains more than offset fixed cost inflation. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact. Higher equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher non-controlling interest for a net decline of $0.01. Higher interest expense, taxes and shares outstanding each cost us $0.01. In summary, we generated excellent financial results again this quarter. We're delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost-reduction efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?
Simon Moore: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 8, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of $948 million, up 2% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 5% on increased volumes with stable pricing. Currency reduced sales by 3%. Sales were up versus prior year due to continued strong Asia growth and improving volumes in both North America and Europe. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, principally from volume growth. Merchant Gases' operating income of $185 million was up 12% versus prior year and up 5% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.5% was up 170 basis points versus prior year and 20 basis points sequentially. Income and margins were higher than prior year, driven by higher volumes, particularly in Asia, and improved productivity, partially offset by the impact of currency and higher power costs. New business signings for the year were up over last year and exceeded our targets across all regions. We recently announced the construction commenced on a new helium production facility in Wyoming, and we also just announced yesterday a further expansion of our Shanghai-based Asia Technology Center. This expansion will enhance our ability to develop Merchant Gas and Electronics Applications closely with our customers in this key growth region. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5%, with consistent growth across all product lines. Pricing was flat overall, with higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen pricing offset by lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of the pass-through of lower natural gas prices. LOX/LIN plant loading increased slightly and remained in the mid-70s. In Europe, sales decreased 8% versus prior year, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes increasing by 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency decreased sales by 8%. Our LOX/LIN volumes improved, however, healthcare was flat and packaged gas volumes continued to lag. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. In Asia, sales were up 17% versus last year, underlying sales increased 14%, with volumes up 11% and pricing up 3%. Currency increased sales by 3%. Volumes continued to improve, driven by a strong growth across all products and markets. We did see some sequential moderation due to reduced liquid oxygen peaking demand for steel. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We delivered real price improvement responding to higher power costs by raising prices on oxygen and nitrogen across the region. Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $752 million increased 17% compared to last year. Volumes were up 4%, and the energy and raw material pass-through increased sales by 14%. Higher volumes were primarily driven by new plants and customers. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, with volumes up 2% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 2%. Volume growth was driven by loading existing assets. Operating income of $117 million was up 11% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups and down 2% sequentially due to operating bonus timing. Operating margin of 15.6% decreased 80 basis points versus prior year due to the impact of higher natural gas cost pass-through. Sequentially, margins were lower due to volume mix. Earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to build a third air separation unit and expand our supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to ArcelorMittal's Gent, Belgium steel mill and increase our supply of Merchant Gases to the Northern European market. Last week, we announced plans to connect our Texas and Louisiana pipeline systems. This will create the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline system. The project will unite more than 20 plants with over 1 billion standard cubic feet a day of capacity and over 600 miles of pipeline. This will allow us to increase sales by better utilizing existing capacity, improve system efficiency by sourcing from our most efficient plants and better coordinating outage planning and improve customer supply reliability and flexibility. Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $523 million were up 20% compared to last year. Volumes increased 21% and pricing reduced sales by 1%. Electronic sales were up 25% compared to last year and 9% sequentially, as all industry segments grew beyond previous production peaks. Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 19% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 9% higher versus prior year. And our Equipment business reported the best quarter in two years, reflecting the expected pickup in orders due to improving new fab CapEx. Performance Materials sales increased 15% versus last year and 1% sequentially, reflecting volume growth across all markets. Segment operating income of $84 million was up 71% versus prior year and 35% sequentially due to volume leverage and the full benefit of the restructuring actions finalized in Q3. Margins improved 480 basis points from last year and 350 basis points sequentially. Q4 margin of 16.1% exceeded our 15% operating margin goal for FY '11 with the highest quarterly margins since we began reporting this segment four years ago. New business activity continues to grow in Electronics. As you saw last week, we announced an agreement to build two ammonia on-site purification plants for Sanan OptoElectronics in Wuhu in China. This is the world's first on-site, large-scale specialty gas plant and supports the high-growth LED market. Earlier, we announced the turnkey contract to supply our SunSource Solutions gases, equipment and services to a new photovoltaic facility in Malacca, Malaysia. Please turn to Slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $128 million were up 5% versus prior year and 11% sequentially, reflecting increased LNG activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity and favorable project performance. Our backlog versus prior year is higher due to the previously announced LNG orders but reduced sequentially. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Simon. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 13, I'd like to share our thoughts and our outlook. For our fiscal 2011, we are projecting that gradual economic recovery continues. We expect that manufacturing will continue as the leading sector in the recovery. Fiscal year 2010 growth was somewhat stronger than expected, led by Asia. We anticipate that growth will moderate in fiscal year 2011, as inventory restocking ends and global stimulus programs expire. We expect that regional differences will continue, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe. Based on our global footprint, we are planning for worldwide manufacturing growth of 3% to 4% for our fiscal 2011. Our current forecast is that the U.S. will see positive growth of 3% to 4% in manufacturing. Europe should be up about 1% to 2%, and we expect Asia will continue to be the strongest region, growing 6% to 7%, led by China. Volume growth will be the key factor driving earnings improvement in 2011 for us. New plant on-streams in 2010 and 2011 and loading our existing assets should each add $0.30 to $0.40 to EPS. Offsetting these volume gains, pension expense will be about a $0.10 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower asset returns. Based upon current rates, currency should not have a significant impact on earnings next year. Based on these factors and our economic outlook, we are forecasting our fiscal 2011 earnings from continuing operations to be between $5.50 and $5.70 per share, which represents a year-on-year earnings growth of 10% to 14%. Now turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, capacity utilization continues to improve globally. We continued to expand our merchant capacity in Asia. Last year, we delivered on our 1% operating margin improvement goal. For 2011, we are targeting to exceed our goal of 20%. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal year 2010 start-ups, along with a number of investments due to come on-stream of this year. The major projects that will drive the improvement from fiscal year 2010 fiscal year 2011 are: Our new well scale SMR for ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which came on-stream towards the end of fiscal year 2010; a 2,000-ton-per-day oxygen plant for the Whiting Clean Energy gas fire is on target to start up towards the end of calendar year 2010; our new oxygen plant to supply Xingtai Iron and Steel should start up in March 2011; and our new pipeline near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where we've added three new hydrogen customers to this franchise in the past year. On the new order front, we announced a significant number of new projects over the course of this past year, which will provide growth in 2012 and beyond. In Equipment and Energy, we expect results similar to last year's level. We do anticipate signing two or three LNG orders in this coming year. Within Electronics, we expect slow, steady growth next year, with newer segments like PV [photovoltaic] and LED growing at higher rates. Each of those silicon processes rebounded nicely in 2010. As we look across industry forecast for fiscal 2011, we project the MSI index will grow in the range of 5% to 10%. In the Integrated Circuit segment, which accounts for about 75% to 80% of our Electronics business, we are well positioned with the industry leaders who are bringing on new fabs and expanding capacity. As expected, electronics industry capital expenditures rebounded in 2010, and it is anticipated to continue to increase next year as well. So our Electronics Equipment business results in fiscal 2011 should grow accordingly. With the restructuring behind us, the benefits of our Electronics business' repositioning efforts have become more visible this quarter. Switching to Performance Materials, our growth expectations are solid, as we leverage our low-cost production facilities in Asia. And we continue to benefit from new product market and application successes. For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we continue to target improvement in our operating margins, with the goal of delivering 15% in 2011. Those are my thoughts on the business segments. Now shifting gears back to the total company. In an economic environment, cost control and cost reduction are important drivers of earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2011, we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. We will also continue to see the benefit of a number of structural cost reductions that we have made to reach our 2011 goals of a 17% operating margin. At this time, our tax rate guidance is for a rate similar to 2010, approximately 25% to 26%. We remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth, along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle. Turning to Slide #14. Our guidance for quarter one is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.35 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant on-streams, including our new SMR to serve ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We expect the manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery; finally, we expect a modest benefit from currency translation next quarter. Offsetting these sequential improvements are a few seasonal impacts in our businesses. In Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we will see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, a number of customers have plant maintenance turnarounds on their facilities in this quarter. This will result in lower volumes in quarter one and higher maintenance spending on our part, as we time our maintenance to correspond with our customer shutdowns. And pension expenses previously mentioned will be a headwind. Please turn to Slide 15 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2010 was $1.3 billion. For 2011, we expect our capital spending will be between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, excluding acquisitions. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plants from customers, such as the MarkWest and Xingtai Steel projects. And we also continue to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions. The majority of our spending remains in the Tonnage area, with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all four business segments, about 75% of our growth CapEx is under long-term contracts. Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. Please turn to Slide #16. As you all know, the Airgas shareholders voted to elect three independent board members nominated by Air Products and to support our three shareholder proposals at the September 15 meeting. We are pleased that the Delaware Chancellery Court rejected Airgas' challenge to the January meeting bylaw and upheld the validity of the shareholder vote. We will nominate another slate of independent directors for the 2011 meeting in January. We are disappointed that Airgas continues to oppose the will that its shareholders expressed at the 2010 Annual Meeting. As we have said before, Air Products stands ready to meet with Airgas, its directors and advisors to exchange information and to negotiate a mutually beneficial transaction. We remain convinced that such a meeting is in the best interest of both companies' shareholders. If you are an Airgas shareholder, here is what we are asking you to do now: Continue to communicate to the Airgas board that the time is right to conclude a deal. Vote for the second group of highly qualified independent directors whom we will nominate for election at the January meeting. We need to continue to work together to drive this process to a successful conclusion for Airgas and Air Products. Now let me wrap up. We had an excellent 2010, growing sales and earnings while making significant improvements in our operating margin and return on capital. As I just covered with you, we are well positioned to deliver further growth and improvements in 2011. The increase in capital spending we announced today along with the progress we have made on the Airgas transaction, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2011. We remain committed to delivering a combination of growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment in the industry for our shareholders. Our whole team at Air Products is excited by the opportunities we have and are ready to deliver greater shareholder value in the future. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to James to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: A couple of questions. The first is, there really wasn't much change in your Tonnage revenues from the second quarter to the fourth quarter. And I guess Baton Rouge is a little bit late. But it also turns out you had a number of other plants at Corpus Christi, Baytown, Port Arthur. Why didn't those have more of a pronounced effect on Tonnage Gas revenues?
Paul Huck: The big impact is gas there, Jeff. Gas is down about $1, when you look at it. So the volumes are up. But if we look at that, the gas from quarter two to quarter four is down $1. We've pass the natural gas through, as you know.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Right, but the sequential volumes don't really change all that much.
Paul Huck: Our volumes are up. Our volumes were up in there. I mean, but the big impact on sales, if you're looking at the revenue delta, which I think is what you're trying to look at it here, is that gas gets passed through in the revenue line to our customers.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Right. I guess, I would have expected the volumes to be up more. But we'll let that go. In terms of, just lastly, on the pension side, what's the magnitude of the pension contribution for next year?
Paul Huck: We think the pension contribution is probably going to be about $250 million or so. And the bulk of it, we're going to do in quarter one.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: And then lastly, what's the cost of the new hydrogen pipeline to link Louisiana and Texas? And how does that get done?
Paul Huck: We have not disclosed the cost of the pipeline for people. And people could do an estimate, if they care to because of the length of it. But we do not like to disclose the cost of our projects on that. And it will get spent over the next two years or so as far as timing is concerned.
Operator: Our next question will come from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John McNulty: And on the Electronics business, clearly the margins, you had a solid pick-up that you've actually exceeded what you were really targeting. And even sequentially, I mean, it looks like you saw incremental margins of like 80%. How should we think about the margin going forward, looking into 2011? Was there anything that may have been a little bit unusual in the fourth quarter or a 16% kind of the right base to start looking out to 2011 with?
Paul Huck: John, if you look at the fourth quarter, it certainly is the strongest quarter from a volume standpoint in the business. We normally see a seasonal slowdown towards the end of quarter one of our fiscal year and then into quarter two caused by the holiday season, first around Christmas and then the holidays in Asia in the second quarter. So we normally see it depends whether you actually do see a real volume decline, and we probably will see some volumes decline in this, and then pick up again in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.
John McNulty: Another question in the Merchant business. We've gone basically a year, it looks like without any real, other the raw material, any real price increases on the U.S. and European businesses. What kind of volumes do we need to see come back in the Merchant business before we start to see real price increases in those platforms?
Paul Huck: And actually I consider that to be a good thing in that we haven't seen the price erosion here because of the operating rates. I think need you need to see the operating rates and get above the 85% or so place before you're going to see a growth in price.
Simon Moore: And John, this is Simon. Maybe I could just add, too. In North America versus last year, LOX/LIN pricing was actually up. It was offset by a lower liquid hydrogen with the pass-through of the lower natural gas prices.
John McNulty: And then the last the last question on the pipeline that you're building in the Gulf that we were talking about, how do you think about getting returns on that? Because it doesn't sound like it's necessarily a big revenue-generating opportunity for you, or at least that certainly wasn't how it was highlighted. So how should we think about the revenues? And how should we think about the returns when you get maybe paid back for that pipeline?
Paul Huck: Yes, and it has a good return on it. The return is generated in two areas, John. First off, if you think about the sales, increased sales, and we will be able to sell more the product just because we have in the connection with the systems. So we now have the best supply system, bar none, in the Gulf Coast. We're certainly the broadest here. So our reach to customers is, by far, the best. And our ability to deliver to those customers is, by far, the best. So we would expect to see an increase in sales on that. The second aspect is that we are also going to be able to source the product a lot better. We're going able to pick and get to the lowest-cost source for us to go out and generate the hydrogen and optimize the plants across the systems. So we think that it's a combination of cost and revenue but those both those give us a very nice return on the project, if you just look at the amount of investment required there.
Operator: Now we'll hear from Michael Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael Sison: In total, Paul, when you take a look at volume growth for '11, and I apologize if I missed this, you add up all the loadings for Merchant and Electronics and Tonnage, but what do you expect for volume growth for full company?
Paul Huck: And we expect an impact, as I said before, Mike. First on the new plants, which we brought on-stream into '10 and '11, probably, which impact about $0.30 to $0.40 a share. And then the other thing is that we will also load the existing asset base which we have, which will probably generate another $0.30 to $0.40 a share also for us.
Michael Sison: Yes, so I mean volume growth for Air Products in '11 versus...
Paul Huck: Air Products in total?
Michael Sison: Yes, in total.
Paul Huck: On a volume growth basis, we don't run indices on this, Mike, so I'll give you an estimate. I think it's probably 8% to 9%.
Michael Sison: Right. And then in terms of your silicon growth outlook for the full year, the 5% to 10%, is the fiscal first quarter going to be much higher than that than sort of a little bit lower for the rest of the year?
Paul Huck: It jumps around a lot on the individual quarters. I don't know about that, Mike. If I had to guess right now, I would think of that, that growth is pretty steady across the year. And the reason why is that Electronics ran hard in Q1 of our 2010. And we think of that we're more likely to see now that of production has gone up, that is not going to run and more likely to take a drop in production rates over the December-through-February time frame. But we're still seeing -- we have more fabs on-stream, the fabs are running harder than what they are running a year ago. So we still are looking for a good set of volumes in our Electronics business in quarter one.
Michael Sison: In terms of Electronics and Performance Materials with profitability of 16%, was the Electronics side in the fourth quarter basically running full out?
Paul Huck: No, we still have room to grow in Electronics.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Several questions on Electronics here, but just one more. How much of your growth is from traditional silicon these days versus LCD and Photovoltaic business? And then secondly, can you compare margins in the IC business versus LCD and Photovoltaic?
Paul Huck: Simon, since you just came from the business, please take that question, okay?
Simon Moore: Yes, sure. So I think, just to kind of frame out our  Electronics business, about three quarters or so of it is in the IC business; LCD, about 15%; and then the last 10% is made out of PV, LED. So the growth rates on the PV LED are quite high as they are coming off a relatively small base. But in terms of absolute growth, it's still the IC that drives the business primarily. Your second question, in terms of margins, I would say we don't see a substantial difference between pricing across the different industry segments. The customers that are in those are largely sophisticated, and so we have fairly similar pricing across the different segments.
P.J. Juvekar: And margins, you think margins are similar as well?
Simon Moore: Yes, so with pricing being similar, I was really commenting that margins are fairly similar across those segments.
P.J. Juvekar: Some of your Electronics customers had indicated slower growth coming out of the summer, and you think there was maybe some inventory correction that took place in Electronics. And do you think that's behind us?
Simon Moore: So we saw fairly steady consistent growth in our volumes through this time period and through the last quarter. And that's where our customers are telling us they're going to continue to operate. They're operating rates are in the 90s, expected to stay there. And a couple of things that have come out recently, of course, everybody knows this, we've been talking about hand-helds driving particularly the memory market. I'm sure everybody saw that for Apple, although their Mac sales on units were up 27% year-over-year, they still sold more iPads that last quarter than they sold Macs. So again, the concept that the hand-held devices are not necessarily replacing PC sales, but they are complementary in bringing in  additional demand. As another example, TSMC, the Taiwan foundry, announced the month-to-month sales increase in September. So just a little flavor to help you see what we're seeing there.
P.J. Juvekar: And just, Paul, lastly, can  you give us a geographic breakdown of your capital spending?
Paul Huck: Sure. If you take a look at the CapEx which we have, I think we have a slide in there.
P.J. Juvekar: I'm sorry, you do have a slide here.
Operator: Don Carson with Susquehanna has our next question.
Donald Carson: Paul, question on the Merchant business. I know you've put out some domestic price increases on September 16, but you also made the comment that you don't see pricing power returning until you kind of get to the mid-80s operating levels. And you're still at the high 70s. So are these price actions -- are you expecting to get them, or would you categorize them as more trying to recover some higher costs, like power, for example? And then finally, what's the incremental operating leverage as you improve loading in the Merchant business?
Paul Huck: Okay. First, on the leverage comment, it's about 35%, Don, on sales. But as far as pricing power is concerned and if you look at -- and the increase, its early, obviously, because we're still in the first month. But so far, things are going well. And as people know, it isn't across every customer who gets the same price increase. So we think we're going to be successful in the goals which we have for that. The other thing, which you know, is that new business which we're signing is coming in below the average price today. And we've said that before we, and that's normal for the way in which we're operating at this point, with the operating rates that we have. And we will take those prices up over time on the price increases. And they will be the targets of us going out and increasing in the future.
Donald Carson: So basically, you need these price increases on existing business just to offset the price declines on the new business you're signing for your pricing to be flat overall?
Paul Huck: Yes, as far as prices are flat overall, the thing that we look at, Don, is that we actually look at the conversion margin of our business. And so what our goal is to get a positive increase in conversion margin in this year, which is the price less the variable cost to produce and deliver, and get that number contributing in a positive way to our fiscal '11 results. So that's our goal for this year. And we think the actions which we're taking are going to be effective there.
Donald Carson: And you're talking about 3% to 4% outlook for U.S. manufacturing growth, so would you expect a similar volume growth in your U.S. Merchant business and maybe get back up to sort of the 80% operating rate level by second half of fiscal '11?
Paul Huck: Yes, I think it actually should be a little bit higher than 3% to 4%. I think 5% to 6%, Don.
Operator: We'll move on to Paul Mann with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Mann: Just a couple of questions. You mentioned you have three new hydrogen customers in your Edmonton pipeline. What sort of utilization of that Edmonton pipeline is coming in place. What sort of utilization rate will you get to once you get your hydrogen customers onboard? And my second question, just thinking about the electronics market. You mentioned that it was like maybe the account's about 10% of your revenues in Electronics. And clearly, LED lighting has been a big focus of Japan. Energy efficiency is clearly a part of China's next five-year plan. Do you see any interest from your Chinese Electronics customers regarding LED lighting? How do you think of the opportunity for LED lighting in China?
Paul Huck: I'll let Simon answer the Electronics question under the Edmonton pipeline. And we're close to sold-out on that pipeline right now.
Simon Moore: So Paul, good question on Electronics, maybe just clarify what I said before, right? So together, PV LED make up less than 10% of our sales, so just to clarify that in the Electronics side and. We are absolutely excited about the growth in the LED market. As you saw, we announced the industry's first large on-site spec gas plant for Sanan for LED in China. So we think the dynamics of the world being more interested in energy efficiency will drive LED demand overall. And China, clearly, has identified LED as an industry they would like to promote in-house. So we think that's a good opportunity. To be fair, though, it's a modest size part of our portfolio right now. And while it will have strong growth rates, the overall business is still very dependent on IC.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael Harrison: I wanted to ask you a little bit about Merchant pricing in Asia. It looks like pricing in Asia is accelerating a little bit. You mentioned LOX/LIN prices had become higher in order to recover higher power costs. But I was wondering, are you still getting more traction in the pricing front there? Or had the gains kind of leveled off at this point? And are there any other drivers of the improved pricing besides the LOX/LIN pricing?
Paul Huck: Simon?
Simon Moore: Sure. So yes, I mean, we were very pleased, quite frankly, to show positive pricing moves in Asia. As you know, as you look back a little bit of history, that hasn't been the case. It was the case last quarter. So we're pleased by that. At the same time, we continue to invest for the growth in Asia. And we bring on new projects in Asia. We have a fair number of projects coming on. So bottom line is we're pleased by the pricing that we're able to secure in the marketplace in Asia.
Michael Harrison: And in terms of the new Merchant business signings coming at lower pricing, is that something that's consistent across all regions? Or would you see maybe better pricing in a higher-demand region like Asia and lower pricing in, say, Europe and North America?
Simon Moore: That's right. You're right.
Michael Harrison: And in terms of new business signings, particularly in North America Merchant pricing, is the pricing improving? Or is it pretty steady over the last couple of quarters?
Paul Huck: And the prices have been steady over the past few quarters, Mike.
Michael Harrison: Wanted to ask a little bit about the Tonnage business and the outlook for Q1 outage plans. Are your customers seeming to be a more or less at normal rate of downtime or...
Paul Huck: Yes.
Michael Harrison: And do you have any significant opportunities, significantly larger-than-normal opportunities to upgrade facilities or do maintenance on your facilities?
Paul Huck: No.
Simon Moore: But having said that, of course, we will time our outages with our customers outages to take advantage of that opportunity, obviously.
Michael Harrison: Last question I wanted to ask you was on Electronics and Performance Materials. It looks like the Performance Materials side of that business saw kind of a deceleration in the rate of growth. I was wondering if that's a seasonal September quarter issue, or if you feel like some of those markets have hit a point where they've hit maybe that normalized rate of more gradual growth rather than inventory-driven growth?
Paul Huck: Yes, and the business starts to slow down in the September time frame because the construction in the north tends to go out. And so the inventory builds -- and people tend to start to take the inventory down of their products here on the construction markets, which they serve.
Operator: We'll move on to Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: I don't want to count chickens before they're hatched, but if the Airgas deal goes through, do you have any sort of internal sense for how long that would take to get back to the relatively high return on capital that you're posting right now? Will it be like three years, four years?
Paul Huck: Yes, and we think that it takes three years for us to get through the trough and the return on capital, Laurence.
Laurence Alexander: And secondly, on helium, would you mind characterizing the current supply demand situation and what you're seeing in terms of pricing in the helium market?
Paul Huck: In the market, as far as helium is concerned, and the supply and demand goes up and down because of some plants which have had production issues in the Middle East, principally. But it's pretty much in balance right now. And pricing is okay. Electronics drives a lot of demand of helium.
Laurence Alexander: And so pricing is fairly stable?
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy: Paul, as you show on Slide 4, you've achieved your 17% operating margin goal at least on a short-term quarterly basis. I think when you unveiled that goal, natural gas prices were significantly higher than they are today. And so my question is if we kind of strip out some of the volatility in percentage margin related to energy, how much additional upside in the margin level do you think is still available over the next year?
Paul Huck: Well, we certainly are going to look for -- and to drive the margin higher. If you look at natural gas, when we put it out, we said that a gas price of $6 was in the assumption. At this time, gas is $4.35, $4.50 or so in quarter four. So that had a slight help on the margin. But it has a bigger impact on the On-site business, on that business. It doesn't have as big impact on the company obviously, for us. So it's still a good margin for us.
Kevin McCarthy: So am I correct in understanding that you would expect to sustain the current level into fiscal '11?
Paul Huck: And for us, I think if you do look at Q1, I think, and the margin is going to decline a little bit for us because the factors on the cutdown in production in Electronics and Performance Materials, so as the volumes pull back there and also the on-site spending on the turns in the Tonnage Gas business, so we have that as a little drag on margins. We are going from quarter four to quarter one. We have that every year. We see that every year.
Simon Moore: And Kevin, our goal, certainly, is to hit 17% for the full year for next year. And then when we're optimistic we'll be successful doing that, we'll look to reset some longer-term targets at that time.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Mark Gulley with Soleil Securities.
Mark Gulley: As part of your CapEx plans, Paul, you were referring a little bit to, I guess, sometimes what you call de-captivations buying; selling Equipment plants and turning them to sell gas. One, are you active in that area in China? And two, are you seeing some competition for the new start-up that seems to be rolling at the China market, Yindee [ph]? Had they had an impact on your ability to accomplish that goal?
Paul Huck: Yes, we do it in China. We have not seen Yindee [ph] buying any plants today, although I'm sure that they are trying to do those things and look at those opportunity because a thing which we do, Mark, is we look for us to go out and buy a plant from someone. What we want is the ability to invest again at that site. And what I don't want is just go in and finance that plant for that person. I'd like to be able to go in and expand the site for us and give us opportunity to invest more.
Mark Gulley: Following up on Laurence's question, you talked about a three-year recovery in your return on capital employed. Can you share us what you think the decrement will be the day of closing, if you will, and assuming you do buy your gas?
Paul Huck: Yes, I think it drops us down by about 3% or so. And then we come back from there.
Mark Gulley: And then finally, can you update us on the balance sheet, again, following through on the Airgas thing. Are you going to be able to maintain investment grade financing internal capital as you talked about today in Airgas without an equity raise? Or can you update us on balance sheet strategy going forward?
Paul Huck: Yes, and we can do this at the top price which we are willing to pay for this and do it with all debt. So the strategy has not changed any there. We're not going to need to raise equity and we'd remain in the investment grade, and that's a BBB.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort: A little more clarity on Merchant Gas and pass-through of natural gas to energy costs there, can you just give me a sense if hydrogen unit price was $100, what would a $1 change in gas do to that price?
Simon Moore: So you're talking about on the liquid hydrogen side?
Robert Koort: Yes.
Simon Moore: So I mean, think we generally talk about the energy cost being in the range of 1/3 of the cost there, so it could be in that sort of range. Again, remember, on the Merchant business, it's not quite as quick as it is on the Tonnage business, the pass-through. There is some lag there, that's why you see some different things on a time basis.
Robert Koort: And then, Paul, could you talk a little bit about if you've seeing any evolution in behavior since the financial crisis to present? And then looking forward, in terms of competitive activity around bids and implicit returns in those of bids? Has it changed much over the period?
Paul Huck: No, it has not changed, Bob. I think everyone is looking still for a good return on that. The only people who've said, "Well, I'm going to take advantage of the fact that rates are low, et cetera, and finance a plant real cheap on those things," --on the competition, we always have that competition. But we have not seen anyone really out there doing anything, which we think destroys the opportunities for us investing.
Operator: John Roberts with Buckingham Research has our next question.
John Roberts: I wanted to ask about your 1% to 2% growth outlook for Europe for 2011. The volume in the quarter just reported was only up 1%, and I think that was a deceleration from 4% last quarter?
Paul Huck: Yes.
John Roberts: That comp was actually easier, so it decelerated I think even more because, again, you're decelerating on a one-year basis in a two-year, the comps are easier if you go back a couple of years. So is the turnaround here? Is it the lagging Packaged Gas business coming up that will cause things to pick up a little bit because the trend is actually the other way right now.
Paul Huck: And yes, John, the Packaged Gas business does lag. The volumes in that business were down for us as we looked at this year-over-year. And that's a business which depends upon people really starting to invest again, and we aren't predicting that to happen until late 2011.
John Roberts: So it's the Packaged Gas lag turnaround here that's going to start the turn?
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.
Edward Yang: First, on Equipment. Why are margins there so volatile? Is there any way to kind of model that out in a predictable way? Usually, it's sort of a plug in my model. But I look at '10 results versus '09, your revenues are down, but the operating income is up substantially. So what are the drivers there?
Paul Huck: Yes, Ed. And that's caused by the mix of the business in the LNG and the Air Separation units. The Air Separation units, which we sell, have a lot of equipment which we buy in and we don't put up a markup on. But it's run through our sales. LNG, we make the exchanges, we do the process design, it's 100% value added. And the margin in the LNG business are a lot higher than on the Air Separation business. So if you'll just look at 2009 to 2010, the 2009, the mix of the business was a lot more on the Air Separation plant side than on the LNG side and it reversed in 2010, a lot more on the LNG side. And we would expect in 2011 for the bulk of our profits to come from the LNG side also.
Edward Yang: And on a refining hydrogen, what were volumes in the quarter including new projects and also on a same-store sales basis and your expectations for 2011?
Paul Huck: Yes, in the quarter, if we look against prior year and the volumes on the refinery side were up a little bit for us and about flat same-store sales.
Edward Yang: And your expectation for next year?
Paul Huck: For them to continue to grow. I don't have an exact number on the volume side.
Operator: That's all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the conference for Mr. Moore for any additional or closing remarks.
Simon Moore: Thanks, James. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. Thank you for joining us, and have a nice day.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, this teleconference presentation and the comments on behalf of Air Products are subject to copyright by Air Products, and all rights are reserved. [Operator Instructions] Beginning today's call is Mr. Nelson Squires, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Squires, you may begin.
Nelson Squires: Thank you, Lauren. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference. This is Nelson Squires. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our fiscal Q3 results and outlook. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com, and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time, are also available on the website. Please turn to Slides 2 and 3. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the Safe Harbor language on these slides and at the end of today's earnings release. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Nelson. Please turn to Slide 4. Once again, our quarterly results showed the benefits of our restructuring actions and our focus on continuous improvement as we continue to drive margins and returns higher. We are delivering operating leverage to the bottom line.  Sales were 14% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 12% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Tonnage and Merchant segments. The Merchant segment growth continued to be driven by strength in Asia. We are also seeing improvement in both our U.S. and European Liquid Bulk businesses.  Sequentially, sales were flat. Underlying sales were up 4% on volume growth across the same three business segments. The 4% underlying volume growth was offset by currency and energy pass-through impacts. Operating income of $374 million increased 22% from prior year due to higher volumes. Operating income was up 3% sequentially on operating leverage across all segments.  Our operating margin improved to 16.6%, up 100 basis points versus prior year and 40 basis points versus prior quarter, and we remain on track to deliver our 17% goal in fiscal 2011. Looking forward, this margin improvement is sustainable, and margins should continue to expand as volumes recover. We still have operating leverage available, and we remain committed to driving sustainable cost reduction.  For the quarter, net income increased 23%, and diluted earnings per share increased by 22%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved to 12%. On an instantaneous or a run-rate basis, we have improved return on capital employed to 12.6%. Turning to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share, our adjusted continuing operation's earnings per share increased by $0.23. Higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage and Merchant helped to increase earnings per share by $0.36 year-on-year.  Pricing, energy and raw materials together were unfavorable, subtracting $0.09. Costs were $0.01 unfavorable as higher year-over-year pension costs and the final Electronics restructuring actions offset our productivity gains. The unfavorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.02. Higher equity affiliate income due to stronger volumes at a number of our joint ventures was offset by higher noncontrolling interest.  Interest expense was $0.01 higher due to lower capitalized interest. Our effective tax rate for the quarter of 25% was within our full year guidance range and contributed $0.02, and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.02.  In summary, we generated excellent financial results again this quarter. We are delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reduction efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to Slide 6, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of $915 million, up 4% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved by 6%, with volumes up 7% and pricing down 1%. Currency reduced sales by 2%.  Underlying sales were up versus prior year due to continued strong performance in Asia and improved volumes in North America and Europe. Sequential sales benefited from an improving economy and seasonally higher volumes, offset by a sharp decline in the euro. Merchant Gases' operating income of $176 million was up 5% versus prior year and down 1% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.3% was up 20 basis points versus prior year and flat sequentially. Income and margins were higher than prior year with higher volumes particularly in Asia, partially offset by the impact of currency and higher power costs.  New business signings through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 are on track to meet our full year targets in all regions, which represent significant improvement versus prior year.  Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In North America, sales improved 4% versus prior year. Volumes, led again by stronger liquid argon and liquid hydrogen sales, were up 6% versus prior year. Pricing continued to be impacted by lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of pass-through of lower natural gas prices. LOX/LIN loadings increased slightly and remained in the mid-70s.  In Europe, sales decreased 2% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved 3%, with volumes increasing by 4% and pricing down 1%. Currency decreased sales by 5%. Our Liquid Bulk volumes improved sequentially, which was expected. As a result of this increased volume, our LOX/LIN loading improved to the low 80s.  In Asia, Merchant sales were up 27% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 23%, with volumes up 22% and pricing up 1%. Currency increased sales by 4%. Volumes continued to improve, driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen with loadings reaching the high 80s. This was the highest revenue quarter ever in Asia. We delivered real price improvement, particularly in China, responding to higher power costs by raising prices on oxygen and nitrogen. Sequentially, liquid argon pricing also improved.  Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $725 million increased 28% compared to last year. Volumes were up 19%, and energy and raw material pass-through increased sales by 9%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets as well as new plant on-streams.  Sequentially, sales were down 4%, with volumes up 4% and energy, raw materials and currency reducing sales by 8%. Volumes were helped by new plant on-streams and the ongoing recovery. Operating income of $120 million was up 37% versus prior year and 12% sequentially primarily due to higher volumes and new plant start-ups. Operating margin of 16.5% increase versus prior year due to higher volumes. Operating margins improved sequentially due to new on-streams and lower maintenance spending.  Refinery hydrogen volumes, excluding new plant on-streams, were up slightly versus prior year. As we told you earlier in the quarter, we announced an agreement to build a steam methane reformer to produce hydrogen for PetroChina in Sichuan province. This represents the first major on-site for hydrogen at a state-owned refinery.  Also, as we announced yesterday, Air Products has been selected by Pucheng Clean Energy Co. in Shaanxi province to build, own and operate three air separation plants producing over 8,200 tons per day of oxygen and 3,100 tons per day of nitrogen. We will also produce liquid products for the merchant market in the region. As you can see from these major awards, new project activity is proceeding well, and we expect additional awards this year.  Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $497 million were up 21% compared to last year. Volumes increased 21%. Pricing reduced sales by 1%, and currency added 1%. Each division continued to see sequential volume gains, and we are now back to pre-recession levels in this business segment.  Electronic sales were up 18% compared to last year and 11% sequentially. Electronic Specialty Materials sales increased 30% versus prior year and 9% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 14% higher versus prior year.  Our Equipment business is up 36% versus prior year, reflecting the expected pickup in orders in support of improving new fab CapEx. Performance Materials sales increased 26% versus last year and 10% sequentially, reflecting stronger volumes across all regions.  Segment operating income of $62 million was up 60% versus prior year, which resulted in continued significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins were flat, which was better-than-expected. As we told you previously, Electronics incurred significant restructuring costs in the quarter as we completed our remaining business repositioning activities. We were pleased to meet our goal of completing the restructuring in Q3. While this did impact margins in the quarter, it was offset by higher-than-expected volumes. We expect to get the full margin benefit of the restructuring starting in Q4. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon to grow by more than 30% in our fiscal year.  New business activity is heating up again in Electronics. Just yesterday, we announced two major orders from Samsung in Austin, Texas in support of their 300-millimeter fab expansion. We will double the existing on-site production of high-purity oxygen and nitrogen as well as provide a significant amount of specialty gas and chemical delivery equipment for the expansion. Please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $116 million were down slightly and reflect slower air separation unit sales. Operating income of $21 million increased versus prior year due to higher LNG activity and lower project costs. Our backlog versus prior year is higher due to the previously announced LNG orders. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Nelson. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 11. I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter four is for earnings per share of $1.27 to $1.33 based upon the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases and the Electronics and Performance Materials segments. In Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect demand to continue to remain strong. As Nelson mentioned, we finished our restructuring efforts in quarter three, which will result in higher margins next quarter. We are on track to meet our 2011 goal of 15% margin.  Looking at fiscal 2010, we are now forecasting earnings per share of $4.94 to $5, up 22% to 23% versus prior year. We have raised the bottom end of our guidance range from $4.90 and maintain the top end despite a less favorable currency outlook relative to where we were a quarter ago.  At current rates, compared to last quarter's guidance, currency is about a $0.05 headwind for us over the second half of the fiscal year. For the year, we are expecting our tax rate to be in the lower part of our previously announced range of 25% to 26%.  Overall, our 2010 economic assumptions haven't changed much. Our fiscal 2010 capital spending guidance remains unchanged, and as we've been telling you, we still anticipate that our CapEx will grow 15% to 20% per year over the next few years. As Nelson commented on earlier, our recent PCEC [Pucheng Clean Energy Co.] and Samsung project announcements are further evidence of the strength of our capital backlog. Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. Please turn to Slide #12. As you know, we raised our offer for Airgas on July 8 by $3.50 to $63.50. We remain convinced of the strong strategic rationale and sound industrial logic that underpin this transaction.  As we have communicated before, this combination will create one of the world's leading, integrated, industrial gas companies. We remain confident in our ability to produce the substantial cost savings we have identified, primarily relating to reductions in corporate overhead and public company costs, supply chain efficiencies and better utilization of infrastructure. Coupled with the enhanced growth opportunities we see, this deal creates significant value for our shareholders. We believe that our offer represents excellent value to the Airgas shareholders, well above the $43.53 price Airgas shares closed at on February 4, the day before our initial offer.  Despite the highly attractive nature of our all-cash offer and our repeated attempts to engage the Airgas board in discussions, they have continually refused to engage with us. As we have said previously, we have analyzed the regulatory issues thoroughly, and we are having productive discussions with the Federal Trade Commission. We are negotiating a Consent Decree, which we expect to sign in the next few weeks. That would be subject to approval by the Commission. The fundamentals of the consent are in line with our expectations.  We are therefore focusing on the Airgas shareholders and asking them to send a strong message to the Airgas board to bring this process to a conclusion. If you are an Airgas shareholder, here is what we are asking you to do: Tender your shares by the August 13 deadline. Vote for our three highly-qualified, independent directors who we believe will better represent all shareholders' interests. Vote for our three bylaw amendments, which will ensure a fair and expedient process is conducted, and lastly, let the current Airgas directors know that you support Air Products on our offer. Now is the time for you to act.  We are as confident as ever in being able to obtain regulatory approval and remain as committed as ever to this transaction. Our regulatory strategy and shareholder actions are designed to ensure that Airgas shareholders have the opportunity to send a clear and unambiguous message to their board at the 2010 Annual Meeting, which Airgas has disclosed in SEC filings will be held no later than September 17. Now let me wrap up. We continue to make solid progress towards our goals of improving growth, margins and return on capital, and we remain focused on these goals. We believe that our goal to become a low-cost supplier versus our competitors enables us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. You are seeing evidence of this in the results we delivered today and the projects wins we announced this week.  We continue to pursue our many growth opportunities around the world, and we believe we are well-positioned to win. Also, we have significant operating leverage in our businesses. This will increase earnings as the global economy recovers.  Finally, we have also made significant progress in our offer to acquire Airgas. To be clear, the whole team at Air Products is excited and energized by the many opportunities we have, which we believe will deliver even greater shareholder value in the future. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Lauren to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: In the past, you've given guidance with regard to your project backlog and what it would mean for earnings in the upcoming year. Now that you've gotten the number of new contracts updated, can you give us an update as to what this may mean for next year?
Paul Huck: Sure, John, and one of the things which you should realize is that the projects which we're working on, those are going to come out in 2012, 2013. However, we are in the planning stages as we look at this, and so as we look at the full year impact of this year's projects and the projects in which we'll be bringing on for 2011, it's probably around $0.30 a share or so in growth for us, 5% to 6% growth of EPS when you look at this. It's what it'll add to us.
John McNulty - Crédit Suisse AG: And then with regard to the Electronics restructuring, can you remind us of what the costs of that restructuring was this quarter and how that should -- I assume that it sounds like almost none of that remains in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Paul Huck: Yes, and it cost us a couple of cents. John, the important thing when you translate that out and you just put that on to the segment margins, it takes the segment margins up 100 points or so, 100 basis points.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank with America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy: I was wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing with regard to Merchant pricing in Asia. It looked like Asia was plus 1% versus slight declines in Europe and North America whereas we typically hear of a greater competitive intensity in Asia. Is that starting to change?
Paul Huck: Nelson, why don't you take that.
Nelson Squires: Yes, Kevin. This is Nelson. We've been working very hard at that, and what we've been trying to do is implement some of the best practices that we're using around the world of when we see cost increases such as power, et cetera, that we get right out there and move those into the customer base, and so some of the subsidies have relaxed in China and so we've been very diligent, and we are seeing, as I said in the prepared remarks, real price improvement in China. Our overall picture in China looks pretty positive. The Electronics pricing has stabilized, which is a very positive development, and I realize you asked a question about Merchant, but pricing in the region is pretty decent these days and on the right trend.
Kevin McCarthy: And then with regard to Electronics, you had a double-digit sequential volume increase. It sounds like you're expecting ongoing increases to wrap up the year. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color as to what you're seeing on Equipment versus consumables and where you're seeing the strength?
Nelson Squires: Certainly, the strength that we've seen in the last couple of quarters and what we expect in the fourth quarter is going to be largely driven by the consumer products. Certainly, the iPhone, the iPad, et cetera where we're seeing extreme demand for memory and that's doing -- our memory customers are doing quite well. Certainly, some of our flagship customers like Intel have also reported very strong results and strong guidance, and we are the key supplier to these top-tier customers such as Intel, Samsung, TSMC, and so we're going to certainly see the benefit of that. I should point out also that our top-tier customers' utilization probably crossed 90% in the quarter, which is another good sign, and we actually expect rates at our customers to pretty much hold up to maybe slightly increase in the fourth quarter.
Paul Huck: Yes, Kevin. A good point on this thing, on Electronics, is you have to remember is that going from our quarter two to quarter three, it goes up on a seasonal basis as production normally picks up in that time because Asia has the New Year impact in quarter two. Most of this business exists in Asia today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Mann with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Mann - Morgan Stanley: Just looking at your Merchant division, I mean in the first sort of three quarters this year, you're going to report an operating margin sort of 19.5%, and I think you're targeting 20% in that division. You said that plenty of operating leverage to go. Should we view that 20% margin target as an intermediate target, and what's the longer-term margin target at that division, and what sort of operating leverage do you get? I mean what sort of incremental margins do you get in that division?
Paul Huck: Well, the first goal, Paul, is to get it above 20% and maintain it above 20%, and we will look to keep raising those goals. So we had a long-term margin improvement goal of getting to -- and 70% as a company. In that, for two key divisions, we set goals of 20% in Merchant and 15% on the Electronics and Performance Materials area. As you can see, we are well on track to achieving those goals for us, and so if you get it to 20%, your next goal is to get it to 21% and sustain it there and keep walking up, but we felt we had a large improvement program and which we are doing there. We are going to always be looking as far as the businesses to increase margins, to reduce cost, deliver productivity and value to the bottom line.
Paul Mann - Morgan Stanley: And what was the incremental margin should we assume on return of revenues as they flow back?
Paul Huck: Yes, in that business, I think you can pretty much assume an incremental margin of about 35% or so.
Paul Mann - Morgan Stanley: And then just thinking about your CapEx for 2011, I'm assuming that given the decent contract wins you've had, CapEx is going to go up in 2011. Is that a fair assumption?
Paul Huck: Yes, it is. As I said in the call, we expect our capital expenditures over the next few years to grow 15% to 20% per year.
Operator: And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: Recently, you won several projects in India, in clean coal in China. In places like India, your competitor was traditionally strong. So to break into that market, what kind of IRR are you expecting on these new projects?
Paul Huck: We are expecting the same sort of return which we get around the world. This is obviously based upon the risk that we see. India is a riskier country than the United States, and so our returns are higher in India, but we will not compromise the returns on our projects to go out and win business.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: And then secondly in Electronics, your volumes were up 18%. What are your operating rates in key chemicals for you like NF3?
Nelson Squires: We are rapidly filling up capacity there. We're probably around 90% in key products at this point in time.
Paul Huck: On the NF3, P.J., one of the things that would cheer us is that we still have the -- on the Ulsan plant to bring all those lines up, so we do have ability to expand, to bring that up, and then we will wind that plant up, and I'm sure we will be able to produce more over time too.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: And just to clarify, Ulsan is not running right now?
Paul Huck: Yes, it is, but we don't have -- and all of the lines are not up. We still have capability to, yes, bring more, add more lines up.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc: And finally, you're not seeing any inventory build in the Electronics chain either by your customers or their customers?
Nelson Squires: P.J., this is Nelson. We are not seeing that. It's something that's obviously is very important to us. And as we've said to all of you many times before, typically, when you read about it, we already know about it because we're so far back in the supply chain. But as we have looked at our key customer demand and have mapped it out, certainly for the next three to six months, we have a pretty good feel on things, and we do not see any signs of an inventory overhang at this point.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: You guys noted a little bit of weakness in the European Packaged Gases business. I was wondering, in what countries is that weakness most pronounced? And do you view that weakness as pretty typical lagging of Packaged Gases during a recovery? Or is it cause for greater concern?
Paul Huck: The answer on the lag question is that it fits with the economy and where they sit. The investment activity in Europe is obviously very slow at this point in time, so there is a drag on Packaged Gases in there. So there is not a cause for concern here. We are seeing a normal recovery type of activities at this point in time. The countries in which we've been hurt the most have been the ones in the South: Spain, Portugal, Italy as examples. Those are the ones which have the largest drags on them right now because their economies have been hurt the most.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: And what sort of metrics do you look at as leading indicators in that European Packaged Gases business? In which direction are they pointing right now?
Paul Huck: Yes. If you look at it, the one thing we should look at is the manufacturing activity, is something, which is starting to point up, so that's good news. The other measure is investment activity. That's still pointing downward, so nonresidential construction is a good one. For the others, there's some other one as far as investment is concerned. But that is trending down and so that is somewhat of a drag.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: And then question on the liquid hydrogen front. You mentioned that pricing was lower there due to natural gas pass-throughs, but then we look at the Tonnage business and natural gas was a positive year-over-year. So is there a lag on the liquid side? And should we see pricing pressure in liquid hydrogen subside in the next quarter?
Nelson Squires: Mike, this is Nelson. Yes, there is a lag. It's the way the contracts operate. We basically recalibrate that portion of the price, typically a quarterly basis and so that has lagged. And we would expect that to subside going forward as natural gas prices basically stabilize versus what we have seen over the year-on-year and fairly significant drops still.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Last question I had is on the guidance. You have a $0.06 range in the guidance. That's a little bit wider than the last couple of quarters. Are you guys seeing additional uncertainty right now? And can you maybe walk through some of the factors that could swing earnings toward the high end or the low end of your guidance range?
Paul Huck: Yes, Mike. And the thing -- is reason why I have a wider range is on the currency for us. I mentioned that we had B. Currency kind of dragged us down about $0.02 against our guidance last quarter in here and it's a continuing drag, so it's about $0.05 for the last half of the year for us. So that volatility in currency is why I put a greater amount of movement up or down in that thing. I just -- normally, currency rates have not been fluctuating as much and that's why I don't think there's any more volatility in the business. We have a pretty good look on the economy going forward for us, and we still feel that it's playing out as we expected, which is for just good steady, slow growth here in the U.S. It's starting to turn in Europe in the second half, which we're starting to see. And Asia it had a B coming up, but it's not going to grow as strong year-over-year, but it's still going to be the best growth in the world. So we think our economic assumptions are still fine. They don't cause any more concerns for us going forward.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Do you have a specific euro rate that you're assuming in your FX outlook?
Paul Huck: Yes, the rate in which I have in this whole outlook is about where the rate is today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: In terms of Electronics, it sounds like everything is running on full cylinders, sort of across-the-board. Any reason why we're not at that 15%? Anything else you need to do to get there in terms of operating margin?
Nelson Squires: Yes, Mike, it's a great question. And as Paul said during the call in one of the questions, we are certainly poised to be right there. Our margins would've been 100 basis points higher or so this quarter. We expect equal or better performance in the fourth quarter. It puts us very close, so there are still some loading that needs to occur. We have the capability and capacity to achieve that, but with what we expect to see in silicon growth for next year, which is going to be moderating. This year will be well over 30% in our fiscal year, it'll lower than that next year. We still expect enough volume growth to get us over the 15% margin.
Paul Huck: And Mike, in the return which these guys actually have done through the year is actually above our plan, obviously. This has been a very good year in Electronics for us, and we're proud of what these people have achieved.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And then, when I think about your Merchant business in Europe, it had a very good quarter, and there's been a lot of concern, I guess, generally about Europe. Any changes in your outlook or anything to that degree in Europe generally speaking?
Nelson Squires: Mike, when we provided our outlook for the fiscal year back in October, we basically thought that Europe would be down for the first half of our fiscal year and then our second half, up sequentially from our first half. So the comps are still tough but we are seeing, as you can see in the numbers, the volume improvements, largely in line with some improved manufacturing numbers that we're seeing in Europe. Northern Europe is strongest but Eastern Europe, Poland, the Czech Republic have come back pretty nicely. Southern Europe is still a problem, but we're not seeing anything different than that as we look at that economy. We've always expected this to be a slow ride back and we're not seeing any systemic or micro changes that would take us away from that opinion at this point.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: And last question Paul, when you think about fiscal '11, you're tracking above 16%, fairly, I wouldn't disagree, 17% seems pretty easy to get for next year. Thinking longer term, any thoughts on sort of the potential above that?
Paul Huck: Well, certainly, Mike. And we have 17% as a goal there, we never would say, we want to stop there. We still think there is improvement for us, to improve margins and returns, deliver more value to shareholders, so we are kind of look at that as something which goes out. So if you take a look at our plans going out, we obviously have plans to increase both margins and returns in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: Paul, can you comment on Merchant pricing trends in the U.S.?
Paul Huck: Nelson's close to that, so I'll let him take that.
Nelson Squires: Yes, David. We really, if you take away the impact of liquid hydrogen and look at pure price, and then look at LIN/LOX or nitrogen/oxygen, we are seeing positive pricing. So pricing has remained a pretty good story for us. We have not seen any leakage from that standpoint. It's a tough market to get price in, but the team is doing an excellent job of maintaining price and getting price where we are seeing cost increases in areas where power is being deregulated or just general power increases. We expect to be able to keep up with that going forward.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: And Paul, just looking at the backlog again, what is the return profile of the entire backlog right now?
Paul Huck: The return profile of the backlog is really unchanged. We are in the low- to mid-teens on a DCF [discounted cash flow] basis, when you look at that for fully costed for all corporate costs and everything else.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG: At lastly, just on the potential new projects coming on over the next few quarters, are they still pointed towards Asia and China, or are they more broadly speaking Electronics, U.S., et cetera?
Paul Huck: And we're having success around the world. So we have projects, which are coming in here in the U.S. We have products in Europe, which we're winning projects in Asia. Now Middle East, I'll tell you this, is that Asia is going to be the area of the greatest investment for us. It's where most of the manufacturing expense is happening, but we are not ignoring the U.S., Europe. The Middle East remains an opportunity for us, which we continue to work on. We've had a few orders there, and we would expect to get some in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Gulley with Soleil Securities.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: First of all, with respect to that second project in China, I wasn't clear if that was sales equipment or sale of gas?
Paul Huck: That is sale of gas. The Pucheng Clean Energy Corp. is a sale of gas. It's actually the largest sale of gas order we've ever taken in the company's history, so we're pretty excited about that.
Paul Huck: Mark, the other thing on that project is it's also a great success story for us and our engineering team in what we've done, if you really get a good plan solution. As you know, in this business, having the right plan for the customer and the right plan solution is we think in the gasification area that we have the right plan solution here and for these plants in China, so we would expect orders to follow on in this area too.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: Do you have piggyback liquefiers on both of those plants that you talked about for China?
Nelson Squires: Yes, as a matter of fact, we'll see those come on stream earlier than the full investment. There's a great opportunity there. We're the first mover in that region. We'll be the first major gas company in the region. So yes, we will be bringing Merchant capacity there.
Paul Huck: And that's on the plan for PPCEC (sic) [PCEC], the PetroChina plant is a hydrogen plant market, and that's how you say it. But that also goes with -- and we also announced a previous order for that same site on the oxygen side, which we won earlier in this year, and we will also have a liquefier on that.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities Group, Inc.: Sticking with Merchants, if I may, it's the largest business by earnings, but it has the slowest growth right now. So Nelson, when do you think you might get back to normal growth rates in LOX/LIN globally? And what might that level of growth be?
Nelson Squires: Well, certainly, we're well ahead of trend in Asia with regards to growth. We expect the North American numbers to improve a bit next year. We think we're in a slow steady improvement there. Europe, as Paul said earlier, we think the manufacturing trend will continue to improve. And so we think we'll begin to see a more normal profile over the next, let's say four to six quarters in terms of what our growth rates look like.
Paul Huck: And Mark, to comment on it a little bit, I think the thing that you have to look at in the Merchant area is, that of the underlying growth rate from quarter-to-quarter was 3% up, so that's a good return and do some more growth. Europe has turned, and Europe's is not small for us in this. And so Europe has started to turn and the Liquid Bulk business, improving, Packaged Gas business is not yet improving. It's going to be a few quarters before that starts to improve and once we see that, I think, you'll see the growth rates start to pick up more.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Shaw with Monness, Crespi.
Christopher Shaw - UBS Investment Bank: You might have given this number, but on the Tonnage side, you gave a 4% sequential growth in volume. I was wondering, could you split that out between what was new plants and what was actual new loadings, higher loadings?
Paul Huck: Yes. If you look at that, it was about half and half.
Christopher Shaw - UBS Investment Bank: And then in the Equipment and Energy, it's doing fairly well on the profit side, but is there going to be, at some point, when, I guess, the LNG shakers come on or orders start picking up, that the sales parts are going to be ramping up? Will there be an inflection points in the quarter that we should expect?
Paul Huck: I would not see -- and the sales growth in that area is going to be large, quarter-to-quarter in the near term. The LNG margins are much better, and they're better than the air separation margins. So they've actually improved the margins as sales have declined a little bit this year for us, and the air separation mix has gotten less to the LNG mix for us.
Christopher Shaw - UBS Investment Bank: And do you still think there's upsides in the margins from here?
Paul Huck: Yes, there is. And we obviously had a good quarter, here, in this business, but the margins -- and they move a little bit around. I mean, it's the absolute profit in which we pay a lot of attention to in this business in the value delivered, because that's a real measure of value added and not sales.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research Associations: I'm trying to actually find the U.S. recovery in your Merchant volumes. Your year-ago Merchant volumes in North America were down 19%, so you had a really easy comp there and you're up 6% this quarter. You're only up 5% last quarter, and the total global number was up 4% sequentially. I don't know what the North American sequential Merchant growth was, but it seasonally would pick up normally. So is there more than just a seasonal improvement? And any real sign of recovery in your Merchant Liquid business in North America?
Paul Huck: And there is a sign of improvement as we've gone on. But as I said before, the economy is slow and steady. It is not going to be fast. We are starting to lap the improvement, the pickup which we saw. We started to see pickup in quarter three of last year, and so we have not gone down. Prior to this, what we were seeing is declines in volumes and now we're starting to see when we're lapping increases in volumes. So we are pleased by the progress in the business here as far as volume is concerned. The other thing is that the performance on price has been very good for us here, and we're going to maintain our discipline and stay at that. But overall, we believe that the progress in which we're making here, as far as volume is concerned, fits with what we're seeing in the underlying economy. We run correlations to that all the time.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research Associations: And then back to Electronics, just quickly, Paul, I think you said it normally seasonally increases into your September quarter here, but I think Nelson said you expect the customer operating rates to hold up that's there. You're expecting to more than hold up?
Paul Huck: And Chris, and the comment was that it seasonally increases from our quarter two to quarter three. And so -- and that's the March quarter to the June quarter.
Nelson Squires: It's by the things that we see.
Paul Huck: I'm sorry, John, I misquote.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research Associations: But June to September would be more stable rather than...
Paul Huck: In June to September, yes, as far the customer operating rates, and they would be typically about the same unless they start to see some growth. And we're starting to see some of those guys, the operating rates, pick up a little bit more. So we predict a good quarter for us in Electronics on the volume side. Everything in that business looks solid. There's been some concerns on people building the inventory end of this. We are not seeing those builds come through from our customer or their concerns about that.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: Is there any clarity on whether or not the movement of the shareholder meeting up to January at Airgas? Is that a simple majority or a super majority? Or that hasn't been decided yet?
Paul Huck: Our position, that is a simple majority. They have obviously come back and said that it is not -- it requires -- it's governed under something else, another bible. We believe it's quite clear that we should prevail on this. It has not been challenged in court yet, so there has not been a ruling on it for things. As far as Airgas is concerned, we think we have made good progress. We are positioned well. A lot of stock has moved to the ARBs and the hedge funds and real progress on the FTC, which I mentioned earlier here. Our price, as far as things, and we made them move here to get more shares in the hands of ARBs. We think that was well timed, and we think that happened. We still have a top price and a limit there. That has not changed. As far as that -- is we do not need to do this deal. Everyone should maintain and understand. We will not chase this price up. We will not get into a bidding war on this thing as far as I'm concerned. But we think we are positioned well with the stock moving to ARBs and the progress with the FTC, which gives us real advantage.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated: And then finally in the cost-containment efforts here, between the two quarters sequentially, it's swung about $0.13 and I know you mentioned pension and electronics restructuring. I'm just wondering if you can talk about the trend from this quarter to next quarter. Do those continue to stay at elevated levels, or can we get some relief there?
Paul Huck: Yes. Well, as far as the trend here from quarter-to-quarter, one of the things which you should remember is that we had a distinct impact of the cost reduction efforts, which occurred in quarter three last year for us and so we had a distinct margin improvements, which were driven by costs. So our comparables got a little bit tougher. Yes, pension is up. Pension's been up for the whole year. We are on track to deliver the $0.35 of improvement from cost for the year. Cost performance should get a little bit better as I go from quarter three to quarter four. There are a few things in this quarter such as Electronics restructuring costs, et cetera, which had for us. But we are in a good position as far as costs has been. Costs are not leaking back in, our margins show that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just a question on the Electronics side, obviously, a dramatic recovery from the depths of despair of not so long ago. What do you see happening on -- as we go into the next fiscal year? Can you still maintain a very lofty 20-plus-percent silicon acreage growth rate? Or do you think we're going to see some pretty dramatic deceleration back to a more steady-state rate?
Paul Huck: Yes, Bob. I do not think that, and that we're going to see, a growth rate in the 30% range. If I had -- and we're trying to look right now. I would think the thing which we're going to have is something in the low-double digits. Remember they went to a fairly easy comp for them because they dropped so much, and that's why the growth rates are so high. But we have been pleased by these markets, I mean, Electronics has proven the bounce back very well. And it's also been proven that something that consumers want to buy as consumer spending has returned.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Reitzes with BroadArch Capital.
Robert Reitzes - Bear Stearns: Paul, just wanted to ask you one question, what gives you the confidence that you're going to have a strong second half in Europe?
Paul Huck: And that comes from -- and the outlook on the business in which we're thinking, and we get TP [ph] and we get information from our customers all the time, and we watch volumes, we watch volume trends. We've had good signings and as we start to bring those signings on stream, we see just a solid slow growth in the business in Europe. LOX/LIN has started to pick it up, LAR has started to pick up on a sequential basis. Packaged Gases has not picked up yet, so that's still an upside for us. But overall, on a year-on-year basis, all those things considered, we had a fairly good improvement over the prior year and a decent improvement sequentially. So we expect that to continue. So it's not going to be a B, Bob. It's a long, slow ride.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Co.: This is Lucy Watson on for Laurence today. Just a couple of clarification questions. On Electronics, as your customers run closer to their capacity limit, do you expect to see any sequential slowing in month-over-month momentum until your customers start bringing more capacity on stream or I guess, would you mind just providing a little bit more color there?
Nelson Squires: Yes, Lucy this is Nelson. Our customers still have a fair amount of capacity. As Paul pointed out, we're coming back from a pretty significant down, with silicon being down 59% at the bottom of the recession, so there is still capacity available. What's encouraging about the state of affairs for our customers is that in places like memory, we're actually seeing pricing go up in memory. And so, it does look like they're being more disciplined about how they add CapEx. But as you can see from the Samsung announcement from us yesterday, some of our key customers are beginning to loosen the purse strings again and move forward. So we think it actually will allow for a normal progression from here, solid silicon growth rates, CapEx coming on in a logical manner and hopefully giving us some multiple years here of stability.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Co.: And then just to clarify your earlier comment on the Middle East opportunity, how are you thinking about the timing of an acceleration there?
Paul Huck: We are currently working on a number of opportunities there. It's always tough to predict when an award is going to happen, but we would hope for an award sometime within the next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: How much were hydrogen tonnage volumes up for the quarter and for the year?
Paul Huck: About 20% against prior year in this quarter. And that has to do with all the new capital, which we're bringing on. And if you look on the year-to-date, we're about 8%.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And in the beginning of your presentation, you said that your underlying sales for the quarter were up about 12%. So if you looked at your business in April, May and June, what was the trend? Was June greater than 12%, or less than 12%, or a lot greater, or a lot less?
Paul Huck: Jeff, it is always hard to take a month and compare it. And so I never get overly excited by a month because we have holidays around the world, which fall in months which are different and things like that.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Well, what is just for all that?
Paul Huck: No. What I'll try to do is I'll try to give you the trend here in which we're seeing. So as far as growth rates are concerned, and this goes on a sequential basis, I think we are seeing kind of slow sequential growth around the world every month. Things are getting better a little bit. We have not seen anything roll over, which gives us any concern from an economy side of things, and things which change from things. But we aren't seeing a tremendous acceleration either. So for this quarter, we saw, on Europe, and we saw them turn a little bit more positive for us, but that was as expected. It fit with our plan. Asia trends, obviously, they had a B. We expect them to not be as strong next year-over-year. They had an easy comp this year. The United States, I think, we expect the growth rate to be kind of slow and steady and fits with what we have seen. So anything growing in the summer, I think we're expecting sequential growth for us.
Operator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, Mr. Squires, I'll turn the call back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Nelson Squires: Thanks, Lauren. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 p.m. today. Thank you for joining us, and have a nice day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Nelson Squares: Thank you Treka. Good morning and welcome to Air Products second quarter earnings teleconference, this is Nelson Squares. Today our CFO, Paul Huck and I will review our fiscal Q2 results and provide some thoughts about the rest of the year. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to www.airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call, beginning at 02:00pm Eastern Time are also available on the website. Please turn to slides two and three. As always today’s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the safe-harbor language on these slides and at the end of today’s earnings release. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks Nelson. With half of our fiscal year 2010 behind us, we are well on our way to delivering on our financial targets. Please turn to slide number four. This slide highlights some of the key financial metrics and the progress that we have made coming out of the recession. Just a bit of history; if you take a look at the left side of this slide, you’ll see the improvements that we have made as an organization, over the five-year period before the recession. We have moved our margin up a couple of 100 basis points, and we improved our return on capital by just short of 400 basis points. The other thing you can see on the right side of this slide is the impact of the global recession on the first half of our fiscal 2009. During that time we took a number of significant actions to position us appropriately coming out of the recession. Our results show the progress we have made since then, and the impact of those actions on our first half results, and the sequential improvement that we are continuing to make as an organization. Sales continued to improve as our underlying sales growth, which turn positive last quarter continued to recover. Year-to-date underlying sales growth is up 6%. Our operating margin in the first half has improved to 16%, and we remain on-track to deliver on our 17% goal in fiscal 2011. Earnings growth remains strong, and as you already seen in our press release this morning, we raised our full year earnings per share guidance again this quarter. We now expect earning per share growth to exceed 20% this fiscal year; and most importantly we continue to drive return on capital, and employ it higher, striving to keep our return on capital three to five points above our cost of capital across the cycle. This lower cost structure makes us even more competitive and well positioned, to grow faster with higher returns. Please turn to slide number five for a quick look at the current quarter. Sales increased 15% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 9% year-on-year, due to higher volumes in our electronics and performance material segment, and our tonnage segment. Volume performance in our merchant segment continued to be mixed, with strength in Asia being offset by slower recovery in both the U.S. and Europe. Higher natural gas prices, which raised our contractual pass through of energy related costs increased sales by 2%. Additionally, favorable currency translation from a weaker dollar increased sales by 4%. Sequentially sales increased 3%, with underlying sales up 3% on volume growth across all business segments versus the prior quarter. Operating income of $364 million increased 40% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes and better cost performance. As a result, our operating margin of 16.2% improved by 290 basis points versus last year. This improvement in margin can be sustained and should continue to improve as volumes recover. Looking forward we still have significant operating leverage available. For the quarter net income increased 41%, and diluted earnings per share increased by 38%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved 70 basis points sequentially, to 11.6% on an instantaneous or run rate basis. We have improved return on capital employed to 12.1%. Turning to slide six for a review of the factors that affected the quarters performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.34. Higher volumes in electronics and performance materials and tonnage helped to increase earnings per share by $0.29 year-on-year. Pricing energy and raw material all together were unfavorable subtracting $0.9. Costs were $0.12 favorable, reflecting our significant cost improvement efforts. The favorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.05. Equity affiliate income was up $0.02; non-controlling interest was up lowering EPS by $0.02, and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.03. In summary, we generated solid financial results again this quarter. We are delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reductions efforts. Now I’ll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson.
Nelson Squares: Thanks Paul. Please turn to slide seven; Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of $922 million, up 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales were flat with volumes up 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency increased sales by 6% versus prior quarter underlying sales were up modestly due to strong performance in Asia, and we are negatively impacted by currency. Merchant Gases operating income of $178 million was up 14% versus prior year, and down 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.3% was up 140 basis points versus prior year and down 100 basis points sequentially. Year-on-year income and margins benefited from higher volumes and improved cost performance. Sequential operating income and margins were impacted by poor weather conditions in Europe in January, as well as lunar New Year in Asia. Signings at the mid-year point are on track to meet our full year targets in all regions. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to slide eight. In North America sales improved 2% versus prior year. Volumes led by stronger liquid argon and liquid hydrogen sales were up 5% versus prior year. Pricing continued to be impacted by lower surcharge activity, and lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of cost pass through of lower natural gas cost. LOXLIN loading remained in the mid-70s. In Europe, sales increased 6% versus the prior year. Underlying sales declined 2%, with volumes down 2% and pricing flat. Currency increased sales by 8%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment in Southern Europe, but we are helped by increased health care volumes. LOXLIN loadings also remained in the mid-70s. In Asia, merchant sales were up 24% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 18%, with volumes up 22%, and pricing down 4%. Currency increased sales by 6%. Volumes continued to rebound significantly across the region, driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen customers. March was the best month in our history in the region and our volumes this quarter surpassed our 2008 peak. The price decline is primarily tied to lower liquid argon pricing, and supply has rebounded quicker than demand, as new piggyback sources have been brought on stream. Please turn to slide nine; tonnage gases. Sales of $757 million increased 21% compared to last year. Volumes were up 11%, energy and raw material pass through increased sales by 6%, and currency increased sales by 4%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets, as well as new plant on streams. Sequentially sales were up 8% due to energy and raw material pass through. Operating income of $107 million was up 9% versus the prior year, and 7% sequentially, primarily due to higher base volumes and new plant start-ups. Operating margin of 14.2% decreased versus prior year due to higher energy and raw material pass through. Refinery hydrogen excluding new on-streams was flat versus prior year. We expect volumes to improve in the second half of the year, as the new facilities achieve higher operating rates and spot demand increases. Bidding on new projects remains active and we expect additional awards for new business this year. The segment will also see the benefit of several major start-ups in quarters three and four. Paul will have more to say about this in his outlook. Please turn to slide 10; electronic and performance materials. Segment sales of $451 million were up 36% compared to last year. Volumes increased 38%, pricing reduced sales by 4% and currency was 2% higher. Each division saw sequential volume gains. Electronic sales were up 28% compared to last year and 4% sequentially. Sales in the quarter were up significantly versus the low point a year-ago, and were better than expected sequentially. Electronic specialty material sales increased 56% versus prior year and 1% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 10% higher versus prior year. In addition, we are seeing the expected pick up in orders for our equipment business, as new CapEx is growing once again. Performance material sales increased 45% versus last year and 4% sequentially, reflecting stronger volumes. The volume recovery in the segment was initially led by Asia, where we are now seeing improvement in both North America and Europe. Segment operating income of $57 million was up substantially versus prior year, which resulted in the significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins improved 140 basis points, reflecting stronger volumes and solid cost control. Progress on the electronics restructuring efforts continued during the quarter. We will see a larger impact to margins in our third quarter as we incur costs to complete these efforts. We now expect millions in square inches of silicon to grow 30% in fiscal year. Please turn to slide 11; equipment and energy. Sales of $119 million decreased 7% versus last year on lower air separation unit sales. Operating income of $18 million increased versus prior year due to higher LNG activity. Our backlog is rising due to the previously announced Gorgon LNG order, and we will soon be formally announcing another major LNG order with Exxon mobile for the New Guinea project, which was received during the quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks Nelson. Now if you’ll please turn to slide 12. I’d like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29, based on the following factors. On the positive side we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue it’s gradual recovery. This along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in the merchant gases and the electronics and performance material segments. New plan on-streams and supply contracts, including the full quarter impact of our new hydrogen plant in Corpus Christie, Texas, and our increased supply at Exxon mobile at Bay Town, Texas will contribute to next quarters tonnage results. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be; in electronics we expect demand to continue to remain strong. As we’ve discussed with you in the past, we plan to finalize our restructuring efforts in quarter three, which will result in higher cost next quarter. While margins will dip in quarter three, we expect them to rebound in quarter four, and be on-track to meet our 2011 goal of 15%. In equipment and energy, we are forecasting higher energy development spending next quarter and planned maintenance outages at a number of plants. Looking at fiscal 2010 with half of the fiscal year behind us, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. We were at $4.75 to $4.95, and are increasing our guidance to $4.90 to $5.00, anticipating earnings per share growth of 21% to 23% versus the prior year. Overall, our 2010 economic assumptions haven’t changed much. We expect that global manufacturing will still grow about 2% in our fiscal 2010. Regionally Europe remains the weakest and we still expect a 1% decline in our fiscal 2010. North America should be up about 1%, and Asia continues to be the strongest., and we are now forecasting growth of about 10% in our fiscal 2010. Demand in the electronics market has been strong, so we are modestly increasing our estimate for silicon growth to about 30%. Our capital spending guidance remains unchanged, as well as most of our other assumptions. Despite the gradual nature of the recovery, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future. Turning to other growth initiatives; as you all know we, announced our offer for Airgas earlier this quarter. Let me give you a brief update on where that stands. We remain convinced of the strong industrial logic, and strong strategic rationale that underpin this deal. We also believe that we are the best company to do this deal, as our businesses are highly complimentary. Air Products has no existing US package gas business, which is 90% of Airgas. We remain confident in our ability to produce the substantial cost synergies we’ve identified, primarily relating to reductions in corporate overhead and part of the company costs, supply chain efficiencies, and better utilization of infrastructure. Coupled with the enhanced growth opportunities we see, this deal creates significant value for our shareholders. Despite the highly attractive nature of our all-cash, 38% premium offer, and our repeated attempts to engage the Airgas board in discussions, they have refused to engage with us; therefore we took the next step and commenced a tender offer, taking our offer directly to the Airgas shareholders. Our next step will be the submission of our shareholder proposals for consideration at Airgas’ 2010 annual meeting. These will include our alternative slate of directors and other proposals designed to allow Airgas’ shareholders to decide for themselves about our offer. We have also been in discussion with the Federal Trade Commission. We are working cooperatively with the FTC to answer their questions, and to provide information. Our regulatory approval strategy and shareholder actions are designed to ensure that Airgas shareholders have the opportunity to send a clear and unambiguous message to their board at the 2010 annual meeting, which Airgas has disclosed in recent SEC filings, will be held no later than September 17. We believe that our offer represents excellent value to the Airgas shareholders; well above the $0.43 and $0.53 price Airgas shares were trading at, on the day before the offer. I want to be clear that we will not overpay for Airgas. We are disciplined and we will remain disciplined as we bring this deal to a conclusion. We will not sacrifice the excellent growth prospects we have in our existing businesses. We will continue to fully fund and resource these many opportunities. Our cash generating capabilities and reinvestment opportunities remain very strong. Acquiring Airgas would not impact our growth, margin improvement, and earnings goals; it provides upside. In short, Air Products shareholders should understand that we have a very bright future with or without Airgas. At the right price, this is one of our many excellent growth opportunities. Now, let me wrap up. We continue to make solid progress towards our goal of improving operating margins and returns, and we remain focused on these goals. We believe that our goal to become a low cost supplier versus our competitors enables us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. We are pursuing numerous growth opportunities around the world. As the economy recovers, we have significant operating leverage in our businesses. Regardless of the outcome of the Airgas offer, we are well positioned to continue to create shareholder value. The whole team in Air Products is excited and energized by the many opportunities we have. Thank you. Now I will turn the call over to Treka to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Kevin McCarthy with Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Yes, good morning. How are you?
Paul Huck: Good morning Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: You’ve had a longstanding operating margin goal of 17%. With the 290 bases point increase year over year you are sneaking up on that now at 16.2. When would you imagine achieving the 17% level at this point given the recovery scenario, and with natural gas near $4, do you see upside to that level as you look into fiscal 2011 and beyond.
Paul Huck: Yes Kevin. Our goal is to have the operating margin for all of 2011 to be at the 17% level. If gas is a little lower, and it will help that margin a little bit for us.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, and then a couple of follow-up questions on the merchant business if I may. First on the volume side, I was wondering if could comment on what you are seeing in the month of April. Then on pricing, it sounds like liquid argon is down. Would you comment on how much that is off and if we adjust for that and other elements, what is LOXLIN pricing doing on an underlying basis please. Thanks very much.
Nelson Squires: Yes Kevin, this is Nelson. Volumes continue strong in the month of April, pretty much across the board, so we are seeing that March was particularly a strong month for the business. It typically is one of the two strongest months in the fiscal year, and so that played out as expected, so volumes continue the momentum into April. From a pricing standpoint, we are essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. The argon was really just the impact of bringing some new capacity on stream, that basically took pricing down a little bit, but if I looked at LOXLIN in pretty much every region its flat to slightly off. We continue to get some pricing in China where we are trying to recover against energy increases, and so we are seeing the most impact again from the liquid argon in Asia. From liquid hydrogen in North America, because natural gas prices are lower and that’s a little bit of a lag on the price, but the underlying pricing story is still holding together pretty well.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Paul Huck: Kevin just to add to the comment which Nelson had, we did have the $0.09 down in pricing which people saw, which is a quarter to prior year impact. Sequentially our pricing impact was about flat on earnings.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Understood, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Sison with KeyBanc
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Hey guys, nice quarter.
Paul Huck: Hi Mike.
Mike Sison – KeyBanc: In terms of the tonnage, I was curious in terms of the growth and volume there; how much of that was from a new plant coming on stream, and I’m trying to get a better gauge of how based demand is in the tonnage business and so.
Paul Huck: Yes, if you look at it on base demand, and the base demand is about flat for us in the tonnage business if you look at that overall. The bulk of the increase here is going to come from the growth of the projects coming on stream Mike.
Mike Sison – KeyBanc: Okay great, and then what about sort of bidding on new projects to fill the pipeline out to 11, 12, and 13 as business there picks up.
Paul Huck: Sure and bid activity is still strong. Award activity as we talked about is not been strong; however, we are trying to see some things come to conclusion, and we would expect to see word activity pick up in the second half of the year.
Mike Sison – KeyBanc: Right, and last question; to what degree you can offer some help in terms of your comments on Airgas and the focus for not overpaying and the right value, what are you looking at in terms of that, is it to live on a return of capital bases cash flow. I just wanted to get a little of your outlook on that.
Paul Huck: Well, return on capital and cash flow are actually the same, because you put cash out and you get cash back with those things. So it is driven by the return in which we are looking, and by the investment in Airgas. We think we create a significant amount of value by buying them, but we are not going to share [Inaudible] We certainly are willing to share our portion of that with the Airgas shareholders, but for right now, we are focused really on the offer that we have out there, and moving that forward, thinking that that represents a very good and value to the Airgas shareholders.
Mike Sison – KeyBanc: Great, thanks Paul.
Paul Huck: Sure.
Operator:
 :
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Hi, good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: In your comments Paul, you said that you hope to reach 15% electronics margin in 2011. Did you mean that you would touch 15% or that might be your average margin for the year 2011.
Paul Huck: The thing what we are trying to do is, we are trying to get it to the average margin for the year.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: So, how fast would you have to grow in electronics in 2011 to reach that, or because of your restructuring efforts could you reach that even if there were very little growth.
Paul Huck: There would still need to be growth Jeff on the loading of the plant, and the investment which we have out there, so yes I do need growth; but its kind of within what we expect.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Okay and then just lastly, in your various restructuring costs that are passing through the income statement in 2010, which presumably won’t be there in 2011. How much are they in the aggregate, roughly?
Paul Huck: The total restructuring cost in this quarter were about $2 million. We expect them to grow fairly substantially.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question, Sergey Vasnetsov with Barclays Capital.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Good morning.
Paul Huck: Hi Sergey.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: You comments for the second quarter was roughly 50% down from year-over-year and yet overall guidance for the year was maintained. Can you talk about what’s plans here and do you expect it to catch it up in the second part of the year.
Paul Huck: As far as the CapEx was concerned, if you look at our total CapEx, which is disclosed, we are on track, we are about 699 in the press release this morning. So if you would take that and double it, it would take you to a $1.4 billion, which is in the middle of our range Sergey.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: I just want to follow-up on a previous question and answer on how much it would in the lower percent. Did I hear you right that you expect that the bulk of it will come from new projects?
Paul Huck: Yes, and the bulk of it comes from new projects. There is some obvious growth. I mean you have to be careful about the impact of volumes and the impact on profits. The impact on profits is going to be larger from a new plant. Some of the volume growth which we see when you go on the volumes, you are going to see like a steel plant. If I’m under them, then I’m going to have the growth in volumes but I’m not going to impact profits by that.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Donald Carson with UBS
Donald Carson - UBS: Thank you. First just a house keeping item. The gain on the sale of the Airgas shares, did that flow through the income statement?
Nelson Squires: We did not sell the Airgas shares, and we gained from holding them down. The gain in holding those shares showed in other comprehensive income, its not in the P&L.
Donald Carson - UBS: Okay, and then on your incremental merchant operating leverage, it seems that operating rates haven’t moved up all that much. When would you expect to see more volume leverage there? The manufacturing outlook seems rather temped for the panels here.
Nelson Squires: Yes, this is Nelson. As you look into the rest of the year, certainly we see a decent pickup in LOXLIN volumes in North America in the second half of the year, something probably in the neighborhood of 3% or so. We think the trend will begin to improve in Europe, although as we said that previously, we think it still remains pretty weak, and we continue to see pretty solid growth in Asia. We are bringing new capacity on-stream throughout Asia, which of course is planned and is in the sequence of doing that, but we should see volume pick up in the second half of the year; certainly in North America, continuing in Asia, and if anything flat to slightly up in Europe as we go forward.
Donald Carson - UBS: A question on North America pricing, it was down year-over-year. You blamed most of that on absence of surcharges. How is the pricing sequentially and how is the pricing on the new business versus the existing growth?
Nelson Squires: Yes sequentially pricing is probably flat to slightly up, and I’m really referring to LOXLIN when I said that, because obviously liquid hydrogen was impacted by lower net gas costs. Quality and new signings is stable. Its rebounded and off of the bottom that we saw somewhere around four or five quarters ago, and so we are happy with the quality of signings.
Donald Carson - UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you, good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning David.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Hey Paul, just on the merchant prices of North America, shouldn’t it be a price increase that’s given you a little more boost to sequential pricing in that business.
Paul Huck: I think a lot of what it did is it held the impact on the surcharges, which have continued to roll off David.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Just on Asia merchant, is that hard to climb due to liquid argon and you mentioned China pricing being better. I was under the impression that China merchant is still under some pressure from a local China competitor amongst others.
Paul Huck: As far as China pricing is, our pricing in China still looks pretty good, and it really is pretty much all argon.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Then just on the backlog on the awards of new projects, is pricing getting anymore competitive or is it to seem otherwise before the downturn.
Paul Huck: As far as we look at the pricing, most of the jobs in which we are bidding have stayed the same. We did see an award in India recently where the pricing was amazingly low on that, and to a steel company, well, well below what we would have been willing to take as a price and all of our competitors.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Why do you think that was the case?
Paul Huck: You will have to ask the person who won that, why they did that so low.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Pj Juvekar with Citi
Pj Juvekar – Citi: Yes, hi good morning Paul and Nelson.
Paul Huck: Hi Pj.
Pj Juvekar – Citi: A question on tonnage; your volumes were up 11%, but earnings were up only 9% and margins were actually down. So the question is why aren’t you seeing more leverage on the operating income line.
Paul Huck: Yes Pj, we still have a lot of costs in the [Inaudible] area. In this year, a lot of customer turnarounds for us, and so that’s something in which we are seeing, which pulls our earnings down. Now the maintenance costs are going to come off in quarter three and quarter four, and you will see improvements there.
Pj Juvekar – Citi: If you take a step back and look at your onsite business, and look at the last 18 months, how many of the new projects got delayed.
Paul Huck: How many got delayed? If you take a look at that, we have had probably three or four of them which have pushed back from what their original timing was for us. As far as the projects which we are bringing onstream this year, we have not seen delays pretty much. The delays have more occurred for projects which have already been permitted to our outlook and stuff like that, for things which were coming on beyond 2010.
Pj Juvekar – Citi: Okay. So I guess, let me ask you the same question in another way. Are you adding projects with a backlog at the same grade as you finished them?
Paul Huck: Are we bringing in capital spending at the same rate? It is pretty close to that right now. Award activity probably has run down the backlog a little bit for us right now, because award activity has been slow; however, as we look towards jobs which we would expect to sign contracts on in the last half of the year, we would expect that and that we would replace or exceed a little bit the projects which actually come off this year.
Pj Juvekar – Citi: So, you will exceed by end of the year.
Paul Huck: Yes.
Pj Juvekar – Citi: Okay, thank you.
Paul Huck: You are welcome.
Operator: Next question is from Mike Harrison with First Analysis Security
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Hi, good morning.
Security: Hi, good morning.
Paul Huck: Hi Mike.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: I was wondering what portion of your tonnage customers right now are still taking volumes below the take or pay minimum?
Security: I was wondering what portion of your tonnage customers right now are still taking volumes below the take or pay minimum?
Paul Huck: We might have one or two, but I think I’m pretty much out of that area right now.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Right, and I was also hoping that you could comment on the big improvement in the equipment and energy margin. That margin number looks like about the highest you’ve shown in the last four or five years. I know there is choppiness in that business, but I was wondering if you could comment on that and what should we expect going forward.
Security: Right, and I was also hoping that you could comment on the big improvement in the equipment and energy margin. That margin number looks like about the highest you’ve shown in the last four or five years. I know there is choppiness in that business, but I was wondering if you could comment on that and what should we expect going forward.
Paul Huck: Yes Mike, the explanation is pretty easy. If you look at sales in 2009 quarter two, we had a lot more in the air separation side and a lot less in the LNG side. This time we have more on the LNG side and less on the air separation side. The LNG profitability is higher because I have a complete value added component to that where I pass through a lot of compression equipment and stuff like that, which I purchase on the air separation side. So its really a mix between the air separation and the LNG, and more LNG this quarter.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Alright and then I have a question on merchant pricing in Asia. You have shown kind of three straight quarters with negative year-over-year pricing. How big of a margin impact have you seen due to that pricing decline over that time, and should be expect to see pricing and margin improvement, given the strong demand that you have seen in Asia.
Security: Alright and then I have a question on merchant pricing in Asia. You have shown kind of three straight quarters with negative year-over-year pricing. How big of a margin impact have you seen due to that pricing decline over that time, and should be expect to see pricing and margin improvement, given the strong demand that you have seen in Asia.
Paul Huck: With the pricing coming down, its obviously been a small impact to the margin in the merchant area, but as you can see, overall our margins in that area are up and will continue to go up and we would expect them to return to like a Q1 level in quarter three, but overall for the year we are going to have a good margin in that area, and so that could also be helped as we lap some of the declines in merchant pricing.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Alright, thanks very much.
Security: Alright, thanks very much.
Operator: Next question, Rob Koort with Goldman Sachs
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Good morning guys.
Paul Huck: Hey Bob.
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: I’m wondering on tonnage, you guys talked a little bit about the new projects providing the growth year-on-year, sequentially a little bit of pick up, but given the base of your business when you put in a project like the one you recently signed for Malaysia, $1.5 million square feet a day, how much would that adds to your base tonnage business?
Paul Huck: That is a very small project Bob, its not going to add a lot.
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: How about something that would be bigger, and something you might put in the Gulf Coast.
Paul Huck: Yes, so we take a plant which goes into the Gulf Coast. A well sized plant can probably add 3% or so in sales growth.
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: To the entire tonnage base.
Paul Huck: To the entire segment, yes.
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Well okay, and then secondly can you give me some sense on electronics and performance. How long you expect these very strong sequential numbers to continue, and maybe talk a little about the seasonality there.
Paul Huck: As far as the electronics and performance materials there is a sequential uptake from quarter two to quarter three, and we would expect to see that, and so I would expect to see good quarter three and a good Q4, and then we will probably see a start of the sequential down in quarter one. You realize that the business here took the highest hit from the recession, and so it’s going to have the strongest bounce back also coming through here.
Nelson Squires: I want to add Bob; this is Nelson. Certainly the improved automobile production is helping the performance material business, and as I said during the call or during the prepared remarks, one of the things that was very encouraging, that we did take a little bit of a volume hit during lunar New Year, but we were up sequentially. So customer operating rates have continued to improve and key customer rates are over 80% now. So that number we think as Paul said, continues to track upward for the next two quarters.
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question, Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander – Jefferies: Good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning Laurence.
Laurence Alexander – Jefferies:
 :
 :
Paul Huck: If we take a look at on the hydrogen area, we do see a move outside the US in the place like Asia and the Middle East. For us we currently are actively involved in projects out there, and so we think that the growth for hydrogen is still going to be somewhere around the 8% to 10% range, but the shift is going to be for the bulk of the market outside the US as far as growth is concern, and less growth within North America in the near term. They will still be oil stands which could produce more growth if that gets developed.
Laurence Alexander – Jefferies: And do you expect the phase of outsourcing activity to be the same in Asia as in the US?
Paul Huck: On the outsourcing in Asia, on the majors we think its going to be doable. I think we are going to see some GAB’s in China to make these things happen also.
Laurence Alexander – Jefferies: Separately, could you sort of give a little more detail on demand trends in Europe, particular end markets that might be stronger or recovering earlier, and are you surprised by how week it is.
Paul Huck: For us, in the European business the places which we have seen is the largest declines to volume now as package gas. Package gas is the late cycle as far as the business is concerned, and so our bulk market and our bulk volumes have been doing pretty well. In coming back, a lot of business in the food area has been performing well for us. If you look at the geography of it, the east and the north are probably better that the south in Europe. The South is still pretty much in a pretty tough recession at this point in time.
Laurence Alexander – Jefferies: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Paul Mann of Morgan Stanley.
Paul Mann - Morgan Stanley : You mentioned that the [Inaudible] below the take or pay minimum in the quarter. Does that ratio change at all from the first quarter to the second quarter. Did you grow volumes in a lot of the take or pay minimum. What I’m trying to get is whether or not as you go forward, you should see that incremental margin coming through in tonnage, because you got more plants trading above the take or pay minimum, so that makes sense.
Paul Huck: Paul, for the people operating above the take or pays, we probably have some of that. The place which is going to impact us, and the most rare price is still on the hydrogen area for us, and that’s the bulk of our business in the tonnage area. So we really didn’t see our castors go to the mins in that area. Our customers have still continued to operate. Our volumes year-over-year in that area are about flat with those things, if I take out the new plants when you look at it. We have seen on the steel onsite, we have seen increases in the volumes. We realize that for a lot of our customers in steal, it is the take or pay contract, it’s a BFC type contract, and I get paid for the plant, and then he pays for our product charge. I typically make all of my money on the payment for the plant and not on the product charge that pass through the energy. So I don’t have a lot of volatility in the business introduced by the steal aspect of it.
Paul Mann - Morgan Stanley : If your growing your volumes from Q1 into Q2, only to bring them up to the take or pay minimum, you’re not really going to see a revenue and margin impact, and if you start to grow volumes going into Q3, I’m assuming we’ll start to see a better revenue in margin impact.
Paul Huck: What happens Paul, is actually when a person operates at the mins, he doesn’t pay the product chare which is just a pass-through. So actually as the sales dollars come down, the profits tend not to come down, right. Therefore what happens is, that the margins as the loading starts to occur up to the take or pay and above it, margins tend to decline a little bit with that. The bulk of the profit in this business is earned by installing the plant, and having the plant ready to operate for the customer, and that’s where we operate at.
Paul Mann - Morgan Stanley : Second question, I’m just looking forward to sort of 2011. Based on our backlog at the moment and the orders your bidding for, would you expect CapEx to increase in 2011 or decrease or stay up to the same?
Paul Huck: Right now I would expect that my CapEx probably would be the same to up in 2011. A lot of that is going to depend on award activity here in the last six months.
Paul Mann - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird : Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you can or will estimate the volume impact from new tonnage contracts in the third quarter.
Paul Huck: If we take a look at the contracts which have come on stream in Q2 and Q3, we basically have the Exxon job and cooperate electricity plan coming on stream, and they will have a small growth here. Probably they had a penny or so in earnings.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird : Okay and in terms of volumes, just a couple of percent?
Paul Huck: Okay.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird : Okay, and then second in terms of your cost reduction efforts, can you talk about where you stand today, maybe sort of on a run rate verses what’s left over the next 12 months or so.
Paul Huck: We will be talking those efforts and wrapping them up at the end of quarter three, so we are pretty well done. The bulk of the efforts really occurred in the last half of 2009. We’ve had some continued efforts especially in Europe as we’ve been restricted at to how many people we can let go going forward here. So we are probably about 90% complete or so right now.
David Manthey – Robert W. Baird: Okay, but may be a little bit more than that in terms of the shift.
Paul Huck: And that’s true Dave. I think one of the things that you should understand is we are going to continue on this cost effort going forward. So we had the program, but we always have an effort on cost. So cost in this drive for us to be low cost is going to continue. We measure ourselves against our competitors. Our competitors are good, they are working on the same thing we are. We intend to beat them on this thing and be the best investor gas company to drive the cost and the position which we have. So we are very serious about that and we will continue to take actions on cost thought our future.
David Manthey – Robert W. Baird: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer : Hi thank you, good morning. Just would like to understand your thinking on accusations in generally. I saw that you made a small French accusation, and what was the rational for that? I know you were valuating other transactions outside of Airgas.
Paul Huck: The opportunity which we had there Ed was, there was an opportunity in France. It fit extremely well with our current business in the area, so it’s a great opportunity. Its something which we have done in the past in the business in Europe, and it’s helped our business in Europe grow and increase the profitability and scale the business, so that was the design there. If those opportunities come up again in future, we will continue to peruse there. Right now, as far as accusation activity, we continue to evaluate some. There is nothing really hot beyond Airgas, on buying a company. The other thing which you should know is, we continue to look at buying plants which we have sold or other people have sold in the past, and bringing them in as sales gas from the sales of equipment of a captive job, and we continue to make progress in that. The type of projects which we look for in that area are ones which are going to lead to grow up in the future. We bought the Corpus Christi plant in Texas is the reason why we were able to get a good deal on the plant, but then we also see more products being required in the further, so an opportunity to invest and build a franchise there. On the Xingtai Steel, we bought some plants but we also got an order for that to build a franchise in that area for us, and so its those type or opportunities which we look at. We probably have a two or three around the world in which we are perusing right, which are looking good for us in the future.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer : But seeing within the US in terms of package gas, half of the market in the US is still 50% owned by independence. If you do decide to go in another direction from Airgas, it seems like you’re very commented to air gas. Would you look to replicate an Airgas type of accusation strategy? Would you be interested in buying independent package gas distributors with the knowledge in mind that it would take a considerable amount of time to get the scale in that market?
Paul Huck: If the air gas transaction does not go forward, we will continue to work to make sure that we serve the distribution segment of the market. Weather we did that via accusations or we did that via contracts with those people or did something else, would be something which we would disclose in that point in time.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer : Okay and finally, what’s your FX assumption in your 2010 guidance, and if you look forward to 2011 what kind of your exchange rate would you be using.
Paul Huck: I don’t try to go out and predict the exchange rates. At the close of the quarter we were looking at for quarter three and four, for the Euro to be around $1.35 or so. When you get that for the year, that probably takes us close $1.40 or so.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer : Okay, thank you Paul.
Operator: Our next question is from John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
Paul Huck: Hi John.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: The European package gas weak volumes, is that a leading business or a lagging business relative to the economy, and I ask that because at least in North America I think it used to be a leading business for Airgas, and its kind of lagging this cycle because of the credit issues for small customer and so forth. What can we tell from your European package gas business?
Paul Huck: John, package gasses has always been a lag, it has never been a lead in any of the areas, and the reason why is, because a quarter of the volumes go into investment type of activities, construction type markets. Construction always lags coming out of the recession, and so you always see that happening. But the other thing that’s happened, if you charged on the cylinders, the customers return them late. They bring them back and then your revenues drop towards the end of the recession and then it takes a while for those revenues to come back up and build back up, but package gases in the market has always been a lag business. It lags in the European economy also.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Butler with GlenHill Investments.
Peter Butler - GlenHill Investments: Hello good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning Peter.
Peter Butler - GlenHill Investments: Probably I’m a bit confused here. I though the goal with acquisition and with the stock in general was to increase the earnings per share, boost the ROC and return more cash to the owners. This air gas transaction looks like it does none of these things, and I was around when you guys unloaded this business, the package gas business, and you said good reddens and you had a lot of good reasons to say good bye that still look valid. I am wondering what’s going on. Airgas shareholders get the cash and the air product share holders get shift, they deal with the stock down.
Paul Huck: Okay Peter, I will tell you that the air product shareholders are not going to get shifted by this deal. There is a lot of concerns over how much air products is going to pay, and the uncertainty of the transaction, and that’s what has temporarily taken our stock price down. We have a very good plan to go out and achieve the cost savings which we have put out there. We also have a good understanding of the business and how it has improved since the time at which we sold it. We think there are a lot of good opportunities for us going forward here, and we didn’t think the package gases was a bad business. The business, which we sold did not have scale. This deal creates value. We are going to be disciplined on price, you will continue to see that; and we will make this pay off for the air products share holders.
Peter Butler - GlenHill Investments: When you sold that you said good-bye, with good reddens to a mature North American centered business with slow growth, and it was recognized as being a low quality business that would command a low quality price earnings ratio, and all that looks still valid. I am wondering what the hell do we need this thing for.
Paul Huck: Peter if you till look at the dynamics of the business at that point in time, it was largely unconsolidated at that point of time. Since that time period there has been a lot of consolidation by Airgas and a lot a consolidation by product in that, and the business has improved substantially. We see the opportunity here to improve the margins within the business and maintain those margins and continue to grow. We also see the opportunity to take that model and take it into the Asia market, and with the air gas transaction, that will help us do that.
Peter Butler - GlenHill Investments: Okay, I am still scratching my head, sorry.
Operator: And that concludes today’s question-and-answer session. Mr. Squares I would like to turn the conference back to you for closing remarks.
Nelson Squares: Thanks Treka. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 02:00pm today. Thanks for joining us and have a nice day.

Beginning today’s call is Mr. Nelson Squires, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Squires, please go ahead.
Nelson Squires:  Thank you, Ken. Good morning and welcome to Air Products first quarter earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today our CFO Paul Huck and I will review our fiscal Q1 results and provide some thoughts about next quarter. We issued our earnings release this morning, and it is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to www.airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 pm Eastern time are also available on the website. Please turn to slide two. As always, today’s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of the today’s earnings release. Now I’ll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Nelson. As we conveyed to you in our press release this morning, our fiscal year is off to a good start. Please turn to slide number three. For the quarter sales decreased 1% versus prior year. This decline was primarily the result of significantly lower natural gas prices, which reduced our contractual pass-through of energy-related costs lowering sales by 7%. Partially offsetting this was favorable currency translation with the weaker dollar increasing sales by 4%. Underlying sales increased 2% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Volume performance in our Merchant segment was mixed with year-over-year gains in Asia being offset by slower economic recoveries in both the US and Europe. Sequentially sales increased 2% on higher cost pass-through. Underlying sales were down 1% on seasonality and lower equipment and energy sales. Operating income of $345 million increased 20% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes, productivity and favorable currency and our operating margin of 15.9% improved by 280 basis points versus last year due to higher volumes and productivity. This significant improvement in margin in light of the modest underlying gains in sales represents the hard work that our team has done in all aspects of our costs. We are delivering improved efficiencies and energy utilization, operating and maintenance costs and our selling and G&A costs. These are substantial savings that we can sustain and will continue to improve upon as volumes recover. For the quarter net income increased 22%, and diluted earnings per share increased by 20% each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved sequentially. On an instantaneous basis, we have improved ROCE to 11.7%. Before I move on, just a couple of brief comments on some other items in our financial statements. Other income on our consolidated P&L was $8 million higher compared last year, primarily due to large foreign exchange losses last year and on the cash flow statement, our operating cash flow was impacted by $256 million in cash contributions to our pension plans. This shows up as a use of cash in payables and accrued liabilities this quarter and is a timing issue, which should even out through the rest of the fiscal year. For the entire year, we still anticipate making cash contributions of approximately $360 million. Now, turning to slide four for a review of the factors that affected the quarter’s performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.19, higher volumes in Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials helped to increase earnings-per-share by $0.12 year-on-year. Pricing and energy and raw materials together were unfavorable subtracting $0.05. Costs were $0.06 favorable, reflecting our cost improvement efforts. The favorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.07. Equity affiliate income was up $0.01, interest expense declined on lower rates adding $0.02, a slightly higher tax rate this year cost us a $0.01, and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.03. All-in-all 20% earnings growth this quarter is a solid start to our new fiscal year despite a slow economic recovery. We are delivering the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reduction efforts. Now I will turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson.
Nelson Squires:  Thanks, Paul. Please turn to slide five, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of $934 million, up 1% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 5% with volumes down 5% and pricing flat. Currency increased sales by 6% versus prior quarter, sales were flat. Merchant Gases operating income of $190 million was up 11% versus prior year and up 14% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 20.3% was up 190 basis points versus prior year and 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting strong cost performance. We saw the benefits of our global cost actions from our workforce reduction, distribution efficiency and reduced plant operating costs, which in total more than offset the decline in volume and grew margins. Loadings were flat in North America and Europe versus prior quarter and continued to improve in Asia. Signings were off to a good start in all regions. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to slide six. In North America sales fell 11% versus prior year. Sales in the first two months of the prior year quarter were relatively strong, and this yielded a tougher comparison this year. Volumes were down 9% versus prior year with pricing down 2%. Pricing was impacted by lower surcharge activity and lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of lower natural gas costs. In Europe sales increased 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 3% with volumes down 4% and pricing adding 1%, currency increased sales by 9%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment, but continued to be helped by pricing and increased healthcare volumes. In Asia merchant sales were up 13% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 8% with volumes up 11% and pricing down 3%, currency increased sales by 5%. Volumes continue to improve across Asia, driven by steel and electronics customers. China volumes in particular were up 30% versus prior year. The price decline in Asia is principally in Gorgon where last year’s prices were higher due to tight supply. Please turn to slide seven, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $698 million decreased 6% compared to last year, volumes were up 11%. Energy and raw materials pass-through decreased sales by 21%, and currency increased sales by 4%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets, as well as new plant on-streams. Sequentially sales were up 9%, mainly due to energy and raw material pass-through. Operating income of $100 million was down 8% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher maintenance spending and lower operating efficiencies. Operating margin of 14.4% decreased versus prior year and sequentially also due to higher maintenance spending. We announced new world-scale hydrogen plants for our pipeline networks in Louisiana and Rotterdam and also announced a major upgrade and expansion of our La Porte, Texas air separation facility during the quarter. Please turn to slide eight, Electronic and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $433 million were up 7% compared to last year. Volumes increased 11%, pricing reduced sales by 6%, and currency was 2% higher. Electronic sales were down 2% compared to last year and were flat sequentially. Sales in the quarter were impacted by lower prices and lower services in equipment sales. Electronic especially material sales increased 8% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were unchanged versus prior year. Performance material sales increased 18% versus last year and were flat sequentially, reflecting stronger Asian sales and less seasonal decline than in previous years. Segment operating income of $48 million was up 97% versus prior year, which resulted in significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins were essentially flat, reflecting lower pricing and ongoing restructuring costs. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon to grow 20% to 25% in our fiscal year and still expect the Electronics Equipment business to rebound in the second half. Please turn to slide nine, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $109 million decrease 9% versus last year. Operating income of $8 million increased versus prior year due to lower energy development spending which was partially offset by restructuring cost to close a European manufacturing facility. We just announced last night a major order for three LNG heat exchangers in support of the Gorgon project in Australia. Reflecting this order, our backlog in this segment improved to $327 million. We continue to work on other projects and expect additional award activity this year. Now I will turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Nelson. Now if you will turn to slide 10, I’d like to share my thoughts on our outlook for next quarter. Our guidance for quarter two is for earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.20 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. New plant on-streams, including a full quarter impact of our hydrogen plant to serve Marathon in Garyville, Louisiana should contribute to next quarters’ results and in our Tonnage segment, we expect higher operating bonuses and lower maintenance costs. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Asia we expect some slowing around the lunar New Year holidays. This will slow down some of the gains we’ve experienced in Electronics and Performance Materials and our Asian Merchant Gases business. In Equipment and Energy, we are forecasting higher development spending next quarter, and finally, we expect our tax rate will be closer to 26% in quarter two. Please turn to slide number 11. With one quarter under our belt in fiscal 2010, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year to $4.75 to $4.95, anticipating growth of 17% to 22% versus prior year. We have tweaked the 2010 assumptions that we provided to you three months ago. The changes are highlighted in red on slide number 11. Overall we expect that global manufacturing will still grow about 1% to 2% in our fiscal 2010. However, our regional forecasts for Europe and Asia have changed slightly. We believe growth in Europe will be slower as manufacturing is hampered by weak consumer spending and also a strong euro. We believe these factors will yield around a 1% decline in Europe in our fiscal 2010. Asia, on the other hand, is a bright spot, and we are now forecasting growth of 8% to 9% in our fiscal 2010. Demand in the electronics market has been strong. So we are increasing our estimate for silicon growth to 20% to 25% from 10% to 15%. Our capital spending guidance remains unchanged, as well as most of our other assumptions. We are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2010 because of our continued efforts and success in the area of productivity and margin improvement. Despite the slow nature of the recovery, we remain optimistic about our prospects for growth in the future. As we noted, 2010 should be a year of strong growth for us. As we look beyond 2010, we are excited by the opportunities we have to grow, driven by alternative fuels, the focus on improving energy efficiency and the continued need for manufacturers to lower emissions and improve environmental performance. Now let me wrap up. We made solid progress towards our goal of improving operating margins and returns this quarter and we remain committed to our goals while pursuing a large number of growth opportunities. We believe that our goal to become a low cost supplier versus our competitors will enable us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. While the global economy is still sorting itself out in 2010. We are excited about the opportunities and challenges we face. Thank you and now I turn the call over to Ken to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.:  In Merchant Gases your operating margin there was the best in nearly 10 years. I was wondering if you could comment on the source of that upside. It sounded like volumes were relatively mixed in the Western world and good in Asia and so related to that I was wondering if you could comment as well on the relative profitability of your business in Asia relative to the U.S. and Europe in Merchant.
Paul Huck: Yes, Kevin, first answer your question on the improvement in margins. If you look overall, our volume performance as you commented on we were down in Europe and the U.S. and up in Asia. However, what was really Key for our Merchant business in this quarter really has been the long journey which we have been on costs here and we had very solid results year-on-year in costs and really quarter-to-quarter, which drove this volume improvement and these things are sustainable. It is things like our variable costs, improving the power coming out of the power efficiency of our plant improving distribution efficiency of our plant. Lowering our fixed costs in SG&A and operations overheads and stuff like that, and that is what drove it. As far as the relative profitability of our Asian business, our Asian business it has good profitability in it. It is not low profitability. Our merchant business overall is a very profitable and high return business for us.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.: Then as a follow up with regard to North American pricing in Merchant, did Gorgon way on the average of negative 2% there as it did in Asia or perhaps there were other factors at work?
Nelson Squires: This is Nelson. Gorgon pricing was relatively flat year-on-year. Where we did see the impact, as we said, was in the liquid hydrogen pricing. With the change in the feedstock costs, which of course is the lower natural gas versus prior year, the other thing is we did see some of the surcharge activity that we had come off. However, with the pricing of a barrel of oil pushing back into the 70s, in the high 70s, we actually feel pretty comfortable that we will not see additional surcharge erosion for the rest of the year and, frankly stand ready to add more surcharges if the pricing of our feedstock, diesel, does go up going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Sison - KeyBanc.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc :  I wanted to get a little bit more color on your outlook for silicon growth, the last quarter just a couple of months ago 10% to 15%. It has made a pretty good move here to 20% to 25%. Is it more that the first quarter was that much better and maybe the outlook first year is similar or the outlook for the rest of the year is actually that much better?
Paul Huck: It is more of the former. It certainly the first quarter saw pretty good sustained silicon growth, probably better than expected and certainly with some of the companies that are already out with their earnings and information regarding their performance, i.e. Intel and some others, things look to be fairly strong. Noting, of course that we will see the seasonal dip because of the lunar New Year this quarter, but certainly all indicators are that recovery here is continuing.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc : Then Paul, can you maybe give us an update on bidding activity, sort of the major projects both Tonnage and Merchant globally maybe any regions that you have seen some pickup that will fill the backlog longer-term?
Paul Huck: Yes, as far as our backlog is concerned, Mike, our backlog remains in very good shape. You can see our capital spending outlook remains the same for this year as far as things are concerned. If I take a look at bid activity, the bid activity has stayed constant pretty much for things. We had a few awards in this quarter, which was good news as we will be bringing plants on-stream in this year. As we look at this, the bulk of the capital spending, which we have in this year which we are spending, it comes in the Tonnage Gases business for new plants for us and so we would anticipate that our backlog and workload should be solid throughout this year and going into next.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: So you have two restructurings in fiscal ‘09, and I think that in the first one there were supposed to be 300 people that would leave the company in this quarter, which would complete that restructuring and then you had a second restructuring which I think was supposed to reduce the headcount by 1150, and that was supposed to be completed I think by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
Paul Huck:  That is correct, Jeff. 
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Okay. So where are we with those two restructuring efforts? Did the 300 people leave for the first one, and where are we now relative to the 1150 who were supposed to leave in 2010?
Paul Huck: We are on track, Jeff, as far as the number of people which have left for us. We still have obviously some additional people who are going to be leaving. A good portion those people already know those things because we have announced the closures. They go around facilities, etc., which we will be shutting down and so we are on track to deliver the stuff which we had. We are on schedule there.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: The problem is that I don’t know what the schedule is. So, in other words we halfway through the 1150 or a quarter of the way or...
Paul Huck: We are about halfway through when you look at it. We are about halfway through it and I’m sorry.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: You completed the 300 that were…
Paul Huck: As far as the original plan, the original plan has been completed.
Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Then lastly, can you discuss sort of the timing of the additional hydrogen capacity that you expect to come on this year?
Paul Huck: Yes, the additional hydrogen capacity pretty much comes on in quarter three for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pj Juvekar - Citi.
Pj Juvekar - Citi : Given your silicon growth that you guided to, what are the operating rates in Electronics, particularly in NF3, and what is the status of your Asian NF3 plant?
Nelson Squires: Pj it’s Nelson. I’ll take that one. Our operating rates are around 80% at this point, and we are actually in the process of restarting the first train in our Ulsan NF3 plant. We will have that up this current quarter. So, demand continues to rise there.
Pj Juvekar - Citi : Then my second question is on refining. With refining margins down, light heavy spreads that have come down as well, how are your refining hydrogen volumes holding up?
Paul Huck: Those volumes are holding up well. We are seeing the volumes which we would expect. Our customers are taking, they are not cutting back, and this gets all back on the economics of refining is that the people who use hydrogen have better spreads on their products. It is the people who get pressed on their crack spreads are the refiners who do not use the hydrogen.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dave Begleiter - Deutsche Bank.
Dave Begleiter - Deutsche Bank :  Paul, can you comment on the return profile of the two new hydrogen contracts you sign in Rotterdam over the course of the quarter?
Paul Huck: Yes, they are very good returns for us. Our plants have very good efficiencies. We are on a pipeline system there, so you would expect it to be something which will improve the returns of our business.
Dave Begleiter - Deutsche Bank :  Paul, when I look at your overall backlog of large projects, what’s the average IRR return of all those projects?
Paul Huck:  I don’t give the exact number because they actually do vary on things depending upon the risk profile in the country in which we are in, but if you look at it from a it is somewhere in the low to mid teens.
Dave Begleiter - Deutsche Bank :  Lastly, was the Merchant price increase in October first for Merchant in North America fully successful?
Nelson Squires: Dave this is Nelson. We did have good success with that. As you might imagine, it was a tougher increase to implement, but the drivers that pushed us to do it such as increased power prices in various parts of the country really helped to get it through and so I think we would term it a success at this point.
Dave Begleiter - Deutsche Bank :  Was it in the number for this quarter or it will be more in Q2?
Nelson Squires: It is in the number, I would say we probably get a fuller effect in Q2. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Harrison - First Analysis.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: The tonnage side of the business, I was wondering if you could breakout how much of the 11% year-over-year volume increase was due to new plants that started up during the quarter and maybe what kind of volume change you might have seen at your existing plants year-over-year?
Paul Huck: Yes, if you take a look at that Mike, as far as new plants starting up within the quarter, when you look at year-over-year, it is also new plants which started up within this fiscal year in 2009 also for us, which had not been started up in the thing and the bulk of the increase when you look at this really is due to new plants.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: So is it fair to say that volume of the plants that existed a year ago was that volume at least positive year-over-year?
Paul Huck: Yes, it was. We have seen steel operating rates come up, so that is in there.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Then in the Electronic and Performance Materials segment, I was just wondering if you could give some comments on which product lines are seeing the most pricing pressure right now and any thoughts on when pricing might start to improve?
Nelson Squires: Hi, Mike this is Nelson. One comment I would point out is that, as you know, that is a segment that has two businesses in it and on the Performance Materials side, we did see lower raw material costs year-on-year, which did have some impact on pricing and so while pricing may have gone down, margins actually stayed constant or even improved year-on-year because of the loadings. In the Electronics side, it is the traditional high volume products where we have seen the pricing pressure. That pricing pressure has begun to abate. We as loadings have recovered, and our expectations are that we should see continued abatement of the pricing pressure in this quarter as the loadings continue to pick up, but it is in the key products the large volume products where capacity was pretty strong before the fall off, and frankly, customers have taken advantage of that position, but we do expect things again to improve there as loading tightens up.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Talking about return on capital employed, I know in terms of how you measure the metric, can you give us both the way you measure it, the five quarter average and then, Paul, you did supply us with the instantaneous number as well. So what about switching to an instantaneous approach and taking out that five quarter moving average?
Paul Huck: We actually take a look at both Mark, and we would be glad to supply you with both. That is not a problem for us.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Okay. Secondly, with respect to pricing in Merchant, we are going to talk about this a little bit more if we can. If you take out the impact of surcharges, can you estimate what the underlying price change would have been if the surcharge is a pass-through?
Nelson Squires:  Surcharge pass-through, obviously the surcharge gets put in place after we incur the problem and have to go out and remedy it and so they do stay on longer, say, than the problem stays with us, if you will. So it is a lagging recovery. Our pricing was probably positive net of the surcharge impact x the liquid hydrogen impact. It is more of a LOX, LIN comment. The liquid hydrogen because of its high value definitely has a dampening effect on the whole business.
Paul Huck: There is a gas pass-through which goes through on that. I mean, so if you look at, Mark if you take a look at it overall on the business, on the segment there, the margins were very good, but volumes held up okay. Pricing held up well for us overall and that’s the net of the cost aspect, the cost inflation which we saw and then when you look at what drove that, it was really cost drove a lot of the improvement there but solid fundamentals on pricing and recovery of the variable costs in there.
Operator: Your next question comes from John McNulty - Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse:  With regard to Electronics, I was a little surprised to see that sequentially your sales were basically flat despite the semi industry actually picking up. So can you give us some color as to what might have been happening there on a sequential basis?
Paul Huck:  Yes, what happens is we continue to see a drop in the equipment business. So underlying there, we did see the Specialty Materials sales pick up there sequentially, but the equipment business is going to be and what we said is that we think that quarter two here is the low for the business that was start to see sales starting to pick up in quarter three, and quarter four and on as we start to see some capital spending come back to the industry, but that with drove the sequential sales.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Then on the Merchant side, you had talked about Merchant signing is off to a good start. Can you give us a little more color as to what you are seeing in terms of new signings?
Nelson Squires: John this is Nelson. We are seeing good activity across the board. We are either on pace or ahead of pace after a quarter in all three major regions, and it is really coming from a variety of end markets. We are starting to see continued signs of life in North American and Europe in terms of new signings. Asia probably off to the strongest start, which is not too surprising based on the strength of the recovery over there. A lot of the signings are in some of the key areas that we have focused on from an application standpoint. So, areas around combustion and food and some other products and so we continue to see pretty good demand there. So I think the good news there it is a broad based recovery or strength in terms of new business.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: On the Tonnage side, you had said there were some incremental maintenance costs that hit you a little bit on the earnings side. Can you quantify what that was and how much of it disappears looking forward if the maintenance schedule remains relatively heavy for a while?
Paul Huck: So if you take a look at the maintenance, our heavy quarters on maintenance in the Tonnage business are normally quarters one and two. We tend to have more done rather than during the spring and the summer there. So we will see a positive impact of a few cents, a couple of cents or so going into quarter two for us on the maintenance front John. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Don Christianson - UBS.
Don Christianson – UBS:  I wanted to follow up on Electronics, a couple of things. I know you have had some restructuring costs there. Just what were the in the quarter and will there be further ones in Q2 and then secondly, as you look to your loadings in electronics with this new revised silicon outlook, do you expect loadings to volume growth to term positive in Q2 and how we see volume growth for the balance of the year in Electronics?
Paul Huck: Yes, Don, if you take a look at the restructuring costs, the restructuring costs in Electronics were probably $0.01 or a little bit more than that, and we will continue to see those costs through Q2. They wind down in quarter three as we complete the actions there for us. As far as the volumes are concerned, what we would expect is that quarter two is going to be kind of a flattish type of volume quarter for us compared to on a sequential basis. We will certainly see very good year-over-year gains in Electronics and because quarter two also was the bottom in last year for us.
Don Christianson – UBS: So you revised silicon outlook, that’s really second half strength that you are calling for that’s why you went from 20%?
Paul Huck: Well, a lot of the gains I think a lot of the gains which you are going to see in silicon occur really in quarter two here because that was the drop off point and the low point for the whole year. So you’re going to see production on that area be the highest on a year-over-year gain and after that quarter three and quarter four, which did pick up in the last year, we would expect also to pick up and be higher on a year-on-year basis.  I don’t think you are going to see 20% gains in quarter three and quarter four year-over-your. I think your gains are going to be small. Your bigger gains are against quarter one and against quarter two, quarter two especially.
Don Christianson – UBS: And then on the Performance Materials side of that segment, you had some very strong volume gains. What are margins look like relative to the segment average there with both of those volume gains in the new Chinese facility?
Paul Huck:  Yes, the margins between the Electronics and the Performance Materials are about the same roughly when you look at the two areas, and we have seen very good improvement there obviously. We don’t have as much fixed costs. So, the leverage as we bring volume is not as high as it is in Electronics for us, but the new Chinese facility has enabled us to take our costs down further. So we are seeing good productivity in that area also for us. The strong volumes were actually a very good sign for us because we did not see the same dip on a seasonal basis in that business, which I think is a good sign that we could be in for a strong growth year in that area.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander - Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander – Jefferies:  The first question on Tonnage, can you flesh out a little bit the way the backlog is developing by end markets and particularly in response to higher energy costs?
Paul Huck: Sure. I mean if you take a look at the backlog, the backlog on the Tonnage business really tends continues to be in two areas. On the hydrogen for refining is a big area for us and continues to be a big area as you can see from our announcements here, and we still have a lot of capital, which is going into gasification projects in China. Those gasification projects, in order to produce Syngas to further on and produce other products down the road on the petrochemical side. We are starting to see the steel market and some interest pickup in the steel market in certain things. You can see we got an order in Xingtai Steel in this quarter, which is good news for that. So the operating rates in Asian steel are starting to rise up, and so there are opportunities which are coming there. So that is probably the one piece of it is good news, but it is a change, it is good news, but it is a change here, is we were starting to see some activities in steel start to pick up also now.
Laurence Alexander – Jefferies: Then just a question on productivity. Over the last few years, you have moved away from the geographic model to a global model for addressing each of the end markets. Have you seen the productivity savings that you expected, and what is the next leg on the productivity side?
Paul Huck: The answer to that is, yes, we have. As you can see from things like our SG&A, we have continued to drive that down in light of significant reductions in sales volumes for us. So we are on track on delivering all those things. The SAP system has obviously enabled that service moves have obviously enabled that.  I think the next area in which we are focusing a lot is on the variable cost area of improving the energy efficiency of our plants, improving the distribution efficiencies which we see out there. We have had very good progress on that in this quarter, and you can see that on the Merchant Gases business this quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital :  I have a question page eight, which shows the prices have declined by 6% in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. Given that those are really too quite different markets in terms of the energy sensitivity, could you please help us to break down between the two trends?
Paul Huck: You are talking on the Electronics and Performance Materials area? The 6% price decline is what you are referring to there. The price decline it was slightly higher in Electronics and slightly lower in the Performance Materials area. The Performance Materials area was a backlog really on a lot of the raw material costs also there. So you got to be careful with price on some of that because of some of that stuff is looking for us to continue to pass-through and year-over-year, as Nelson said, we saw a lot of pressure in price on the Electronics/Specialty Materials area. As volumes dropped a lot, that brought prices down sequentially. The prices were pretty close to flat in that area.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital : Would you expect prices in both Electronics and Performance Materials to be up this year?
Paul Huck: I would expect the pressures to not be is great in both areas, this year because of improving volumes there.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Manthey - Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird :  When you look at the P&L, there is this $11.4 million other income net line, and it looks like about $0.5 million of that is an exchange losses. Could you tell us what else is in that line?
Paul Huck:  Sure. Yes, if you take a look at our other income line, I will just give you brief highlights of what sort of things go into other income for us. We start out and normally other income it should be a positive number for us. It includes interest income, royalty income, and insurance recoveries if we have some, asset sales. So, those last two tend to be one time, so all those things tend to be a positive for us. On the negative side, we have to the amortization of intangibles for us goes in there and then the last one, which goes in there, is the foreign exchange, and that can be either a gain or a loss and last year we had a large loss there and that is unusual don’t have that. If you look at other income, usually it tends to be somewhere around $7 million to $10 million positive per quarter for those things for us. So in this quarter we are pretty much inline, and last year was the unusual quarter and foreign exchange was the bulk was the difference there.
David Manthey - Robert W. Baird : How you are recognizing non-controlling interests, could you tell us how that impacted revenues and EBIT during the current quarter and as we look at that non-controlling piece that you’re kicking out after net income, how much will that vary overtime? Is that going to flex by a factor of 2 or 3, or is it going to be up or down by $1 million or $2 million?
Paul Huck: It is just a change in the position on the income statement. It used to be called minority interest. Everything above taxes did not change because of that. It stayed the same for that. It is just the way in which it is put out there. It was something which all companies went to pretty much in fiscal 2009 because it was effective for fiscal years starting after 15 December, 2008. Our fiscal year started early, so we adopted this late. So it does not really change anything. It just changes the bottom end of the statement on the presentation.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs.
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Can you talk a little bit about the equity affiliates? Is that pretty uniform consistent performance across those, or are there some areas where you have seen strength and other areas where it has been a little bit weaker?
Paul Huck: As far as the areas and the large affiliates which we have, the two large ones are Italy and Mexico and so their economies pretty much reflect their region. So their results pretty much reflect their regions. So if you look at Italy that is having a tougher time because of Europe. Mexico is more tied to the U.S. there, so it is starting to see some recovery come back here and then our affiliates in Asia, which are India and Thailand, and they are obviously getting better and seeing the boom in Asia, which we are seeing or the strong recovery. I would not call it a boom yet.
Rob Koort - Goldman Sachs: Then on Merchant Gases, Paul, I guess I’m trying to come up with some sort of algorithm that makes sense, but it looks like pricing and volumes don’t have any correlation looking at the regional data you provide. Can you just talk a little bit about what is going on with pricing in the regions and then if prices remained flat today on all new contracts, how long would it take before you would roll off any negative influence of the last 18 months in terms of pricing?
Nelson Squires: Yes, let me start there. Part of this is it is a combination of the product mix and it is a combination of the sizes of the various businesses that get us to the answer. If you look at some of the key products, if I start in North America, the main impact or was hydrogen as we said earlier. All the other products were probably flat to slightly up. In Europe we saw stronger improvements and we have seen more significant energy increases over there. We have gone out more aggressively, and we have seen pretty much stronger pricing across the board, which is yielding the improvement. Realize, of course, in Europe we also have a package gas business, and we have been very busy at price actions in the package gas business for the last couple of quarters and that is showing some impact. In Asia we have seen basically pressure from two sources. One, the Gorgon, as I mentioned before, but then also, and this is partly the same answer, a fair amount of new capacity has come on-stream in Asia in the last several months. These were projects that have been in execution for a number of years and just coming on-stream and that coupled with lower demand certainly have some pricing challenges out there, but all within what we have expected so far this year, Bob nothing really unusual there. In terms of the cycle of this, we would expect that the surcharges that we have in place probably remain pretty steady for the next couple of quarters. It is hard to predict where diesel is going to be, but we have largely converted any energy-based surcharges into permanent price at this point and so we continue to do that with some of the older surcharges for diesel. With regards to quality of new signings we have actually seen that stabilize because demand as become to pick up and one of the issues that we saw same in the year ago quarters, there were not too many deals going down because everyone was sort of holding their decision making to see where the economy bottomed out and so there were some less than desirable deals out there. We have seen that begin to reverse itself with quality of signings actually picking up and so, at the end of the day, we think the pricing impact there as that comes on-stream will be net positive, although it is such a small fraction of the entire enterprise it will be hard to see it.
Paul Huck:  Yes, Bob, I think an important thing to remember is that if you just look at pricing and you don’t look at the underlying things which are happening on the variable costs, you missed half of the story with those things, because on power costs and diesel costs and stuff like that, we are going to push our prices up if we see those things, and our contracts allow us to do that and so you could see pricing happen. Consequently also, as they come down, we are going to see prices come down, and that is kind of the stuff what you’re seeing here in the U.S. and Europe for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Ong - Eagle Capital Management.
Richard Ong - Eagle Capital Management: Going back to Tonnage Gases, if you look at last year’s existing plants, I would imagine that steel, chemicals were probably shut down for the most part. So, why would maintenance cost to be higher this quarter versus last years quarter and basically have more down time maintenance and is the operating income decline mainly a function of the newer plants operating at essentially losses causing that, or is there something else going on in the operating income line?
Paul Huck: First, Richard, the thing which steel and chemical plants are not the major source of our sales and profits for us, if you have to look at us, when you look at us on the on-site area, we are two/thirds plus really in the hydrogen area and so the operating rates for those plants was high throughout this time period. So, we did not see our customers shutting down. So the maintenance which occurred really corresponded to our customers taking downtime on the hydrogen area, and that is what you’re seeing in this quarter. So that answers that question. When you look at the operating income decline, we had good gains in volumes for those things. So we had a positive impact in volumes on there. Then we had a negative impact on the maintenance costs, and then on the operating efficiencies, which we talked about, the thing which we had is we have a guarantee on the power and the gas consumption at our plants for converting into hydrogen or oxygen or whatever product we are making. We typically operate more efficiently than that, and we did this quarter. It is just that the price of gas is lower this quarter than it was a year ago, and so those operating efficiencies which we get are not worth as much.
Operator: Your final question comes from Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities:  As a follow up, Paul, you’ve talked about how productivity has benefited mainly from SG&A thus far and now we are going to get more variable cost efficiency. Can you talk about maybe the CapEx numbers that you will be putting into the company that would support increased efficiency both on the Merchant side and the Tonnage side?
Paul Huck:  Yes, the CapEx numbers and those are included in the guidance which we have out there. They are not huge Mark, we had those types of things happening, but it’s not going to change the curve on the CapEx for us. It is under $100 million a year. You could do that easily.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities : Now is that increasing I guess what I’m getting to, is that an increasing trend are we going to see more-and-more maybe as the asset base HS? Is it necessary to put more into efficiency going forward?
Paul Huck:  I don’t think you are going to see a tremendous amount more going in there. I think, as we look at this, a lot of it just comes on how you go out and run the plants, too. A lot of it gets around the way in which we run our plants and also the distribution aspect is the other aspect of this. So it is not only the variable cost of power and gas in the plants, but it is also the improvements which we make in driving the product we deliver around less.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities : Finally, you are beat by maybe or so in terms of your first quarter guidance. You raised your guidance for the full year by only about nickel. That would suggest the other three quarters are going to be pretty much on plan. Could there be an element of conservatism in that outlook?
Paul Huck:  What you can see is we still have a lot of concerns compared to a lot of other people around the economy, the manufacturing economy. I mean a lot of people have given me comments about and why we think the manufacturing economy only grows as little as it does for us this year and we are trying to be cautious in our approach there. The other thing which you have got to realize is that I’m also comparing year-on-year on the fiscal year, and that is a little bad. So if you look at this, we have the capacity, we have all the ability if the economy gets better to capture that upside at a very nice margin for us. So, I continue to be cautious and John continues to be cautious in our approach here to moving forward and so yes, it could be an upside for us if the economy does better.
Operator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session today. Speakers, I’ll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Nelson Squires:  Thanks, Ken. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00 pm today. Thanks for joining us, and have a nice day.
Operator: That does conclude our conference call today. Thank you all for your participation.

Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of today’s earnings release. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Nelson. Please turn to slide number three. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Before we look at this quarter's results, I would like to spend a few moments reviewing fiscal 2009. Certainly, the world has changed significantly over the past 12 months. In our plans for fiscal 2009, we expected modest global growth. On slide number three, you can see the severity of the worldwide manufacturing downturn. Globally, manufacturing was down about 11%. In Electronics, we expected a modest decline in silicon process, and it now looks like for fiscal 2009, MSI will end up down about 35%. Both of these headwinds had a major impact on our financial performance during fiscal 2009. Let me take you through the numbers. Turning to slide number four, sales of $8.3 billion declined $2.2 billion or 21%. Underlying sales declined 8%, with volumes of 9% and price gains of 1%. Energy cost pass-through accounted for 7% of the decline and currency translation reduced sales by 6%. Our operating margin fell only modestly, due to the weak demand, as the cost actions we took accounted to the weak volume increased margins significantly in the second half of the year. If you compare the first half versus the second half of fiscal 2009, our operating margin increased by more than 200 basis points to 15.5%. For the year, earnings per share fell 20%, slightly less than sales did, and our return on capital employed declined to 10.6%, above our cost to capital by about 200 basis points. In summary, 2009 was a challenging year due to the impact of the global recession, but we continued to make progress towards our goal. We continued to improve our portfolio, completing the sale of our US Home Care business this quarter, and we made progress through the year to improve both margins and returns. Our entire team remains committed to continuing this progress. Now turning to slide number five for a review of this quarter's consolidated financial results from continuing operations. For the quarter, sales decreased 22% versus the prior year. The major factor was lower natural gas prices, which lowered our contractual pass-through of energy-related costs, reducing sales by 12%. Underlying sales declined 7% on lower volumes in Merchant and the Electronics and Performance Materials segments, and lower pricing in Electronics and Performance Materials. A stronger dollar reduced sales by 3%. Sequentially, sales increased 8%, primarily on volume growth across all business segments. Underlying sales were up 7%, an encouraging sign that the global economy continues to improve. Operating income of $328 million declined 12% from prior year, again due to lower volumes and unfavorable currency. This decline was partially offset by our cost reduction efforts. Our operating margin of 15.4% improved by 170 basis points versus last year, due to productivity and energy cost pass-through impacts, despite the decreased volumes. For the quarter, net income and diluted earnings per share decreased by 10% each, versus the prior year. Turning to slide six for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our continuing operations earnings per share decreased by $0.12. Lower volumes reduced EPS by $0.41 year on year. Pricing in energy and raw materials together were favorable, adding $0.02. And lower costs contributed $0.18. The unfavorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.05. In last year's quarter four earnings release, we footnoted two civic events, a plant fire and hurricanes, which each were a drag of $0.05 on our prior year operating results. Interest expense declined on lower rates, adding $0.05. This was mostly offset by a higher tax rate this year, which subtracted $0.04. Lower minority interests and fewer shares outstanding together contributed about $0.03. Now, I will turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to slide seven, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of $932 million, down 15% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 10%, with volumes down 11% and pricing adding 1%. Currency reduced sales by 5%. Sequentially, Merchant Gases sales increased 6%, volumes were up 3%, pricing was flat, and currency increased sales by 3%. Higher volumes were seen in all regions, resulting in improved LOX, LIN system loadings versus prior quarter. Pricing was better than expected for the quarter, despite the negative impact of lower liquid hydrogen pricing. The lower pricing was due to significantly lower natural gas costs, both sequentially and versus prior year. Merchant Gases operating income of $166 million was down 16% versus prior year and down 2% sequentially. The sequential drop in operating income and margins was primarily due to asset disposals, bad debt expense, and maintenance timing. Let me now provide a few comments by region; please turn to slide eight. In North America, sales fell 16% versus prior year, driven by the slow manufacturing climate. Volumes were down 15% versus prior year, with pricing down 1%. Ex-liquid hydrogen, pricing was positive year on year. Signings in the second half of the fiscal year improved versus the first half. In Europe, sales decreased 14% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 6%, with volumes down 9% and pricing adding 3%. Currency reduced sales by 8%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment, but helped by increased healthcare volumes and pricing. Signings in Europe finished the year ahead of plan and reflect continued demand in food, cement, and small manufacturing. In Asia, Merchant sales were down 10% versus last year, with currency reducing sales by 5%. Underlying sales declined 5%. Volumes continued to improve sequentially across the region. Q4 signings improved over Q3. Please turn to slide nine, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $640 million decreased 32% compared to last year. Energy and raw material pass-through decreased sales by 33%. Currency reduced sales by an additional 3%. Refinery hydrogen volumes continued to be up versus prior year. Excluding refinery hydrogen, Tonnage volumes versus prior year continued to be impacted by the operating rates of our steel and chemical customers. Sequentially, sales were up 13%, due to higher chemical refining and steel demand. Operating income of $105 million was down 22% versus prior year, primarily due to better operating efficiencies in the prior year. Operating income was up 20% sequentially, mainly due to higher customer operating rates. Operating margin of 16.4% increased versus prior year, primarily due to lower energy and raw material pass-through. Looking to the future, we announced significant awards in the quarter from MarkWest Energy, Sheng Tai Steel, and PetroChina. Please turn to slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $434 million were down 22% compared to last year. Volumes reduced sales by 16%, price reduced sales by 5%, and currency was 1% lower. Electronics sales were down 27% compared to last year, due to lower operating rates, but increased 3% sequentially, which was in line with our expectations. As Paul mentioned earlier, lanes and square inches of silicon processed were down about 35% in our fiscal year. Electronics specialty materials sales declined 24% versus prior year, but increased 14% sequentially. Performance Materials volumes declined 10% versus last year, but improved 9% sequentially, reflecting seasonal improvement and stronger Asian sales. Segment operating income of $49 million was up 17% versus prior year, with prior-year income reduced due to the fire at our Ulsan, Korea manufacturing facility. Income was up 26% sequentially, due to higher customer operating rates and good cost performance. The Electronics business continued to recover in the quarter. We saw new order activity in both flat panel and thin-film solar. In this quarter, we started up a new plant in Nanjing, China to support our Performance Materials business. This facility will enable us to manufacture closer to our customers, as well as reduce our costs. Please turn to slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $123 million decreased 3% versus last year. Operating income of $6 million declined versus prior year due to lower sales and higher energy development spending. Our backlog in this segment now totals $239 million. We won an order with Samsung Engineering in the quarter for a plant, where we will supply the largest cold box ever built by the company. We continue to work on various projects in LNG and expect to see a new order in the next quarter or two. Now, I will turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Nelson. Now, if you will turn to slide 12, I would like to share my thoughts on our 2010 outlook. For our fiscal 2010, we are currently projecting a gradual and modest recovery, driven by weak private sector spending growth. We don't foresee a significant improvement in consumer confidence or consumer spending, so we believe growth will likely continue to be subdued. Globally, we saw manufacturing retract by about 11% in fiscal 2009. Over the past two quarters, we have seen Asia growth turn sequentially positive. North America has improved modestly from Q3 to Q4, and Europe's rate of decline has slowed. We are planning for global manufacturing growth of 1% to 2% for our fiscal 2010. Our current thinking is that the US will see flat to slightly positive growth of 1% in manufacturing. Europe should be about flat, and we expect Asia will continue to be the strongest region, growing 6% to 7%, led by China. While the economic outlook is not robust, we do believe that there are significant factors driving earnings improvement in fiscal 2010 for us. New plant on streams in 2009 and 2010 should add $0.35 to EPS. Our significant cost reduction actions in the year will have their full-year impact in 2010, adding $0.35. Partially offsetting this will be about $0.15 of higher pension expense, due to the significant drop in interest rates from September 2008 to September 2009. We also expect that based upon current rates, currency should be a modest tailwind for us next year. However, this will likely be offset by ongoing restructuring costs. Based on these factors and our economic outlook, we are forecasting our fiscal 2010 earnings from continuing operations to be between $4.65 and $4.90 per share, which represents a year on year earnings growth of 15% to 21%. Now turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, capacity utilization has begun to recover globally, and our efforts to raise and maintain prices and increase productivity should generate continued improvement next year. For fiscal 2010, we are targeting a 1% improvement in our Merchant Gases operating margins to above 19%. 20% margins or above should be achievable in 2011. In the US, we are currently operating in the mid-70s, so we have capacity available to serve volume growth as the domestic economy continues to recover. In Europe, we are operating right around 80%, and we're continuing to focus on improving our margins by raising prices, streamlining business operations, and driving our shared services model into this region. In Asia, capacity utilization is in the low 80%. We continue to expand our technology applications and that along with solid manufacturing growth will continue to increase demand loading on our facilities. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see some benefit from loading as chemical and steel plants continue to recover, along with 10 large plants and contracts coming on stream this year. On the new order front, we announced three new projects in September, the MarkWest hydrogen plant acquisition should contribute to growth in mid-year 2010. The Sheng Tai Steel air separation unit acquisitions in 2010, plus a new plant order from them, which is slated to start up in mid 2011, and our joint venture with PetroChina will follow in 2012. In Equipment and Energy, we expect results similar to last year's level. We do anticipate signing two to three LNG orders this coming year. Within Electronics, silicon process declined significantly in early 2009. Market sentiment is now positive, particularly in Asia. We project the MSI index to be up 10% to 15% in 2010. As we look at fiscal 2010, we also expect demand from flat-panel producers to be significantly higher. We will also see growth accelerate in thin-film photo-voltaic in 2010. And while electronics industry CapEx is expected to increase as well next year, we don't anticipate that it will significantly increase our electronics equipment business results in fiscal 2010. Our Electronics business repositioning efforts will result in additional ongoing restructuring costs as we have mentioned in the past. Electronic specialty materials pricing will likely remain in depression next year as well. Our growth expectations are high in Performance Materials, as the economic stimulus packages continue to bolster the economy and we continue to benefit from new market and application successes and new product introductions. For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we continue to target improvement in our operating margins, with a goal of delivering 15% margins in 2011. In any economic environment, cost control and cost reduction are important drivers of earnings, margin, and return improvement. For fiscal 2010, we remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs, and staffing. We will also continue to see the impact of a number of structural cost reductions that we are making to reach our 2011 goal of 17% operating margins. At this time, our tax rate guidance is for a rate similar to 2009, approximately 25% to 26%. While we faced a difficult economy in 2009, the actions we took positioned us well to withstand the storm and take advantage of the recovery. We remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth, along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle. Turning to slide number 13. Our guidance for quarter one for earnings per share of $1.07 to $1.15 is based on the following factors On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas; new plant on-streams, including our new SMR to serve Marathon in Garryville, Louisiana and a steel on-site in Asia should contribute to next quarter's results. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. And finally, we expect continued benefit from our cost reduction actions. Offsetting these sequential improvements are a few seasonal impacts in our business. In Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we will see lower seasonal demand. Last year, we did see a number of extended holiday shutdowns. We currently are not forecasting for this to recur. In Tonnage Gases, we expect significantly higher maintenance spending, as a number of customers have planned maintenance turnarounds on their facilities. This will result in lower volumes in quarter one and higher maintenance spending on our part, as we time our maintenance to correspond with our customer shutdowns. And pension expense, as previously mentioned, will be a headwind. Please turn to slide 14 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2009 was $1.5 billion. For 2010, we expect that our capital spending will be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We also continue to work on the acquisition of captive plants from customers, as we did with the MarkWest and Sheng Tai Steel projects. The majority of our spending remains in the Tonnage area and about $1 billion is associated with new plants. Now, let me wrap up. 2009 was a year none of us will forget and none of us want to experience again. As we enter 2010, we believe that we are extremely well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities before us. We continue to work on opportunities to the future, focused on energy, environment, and emerging markets. These include oxygen for clean and efficient combustion, hydrogen for clean fuels, oxygen for gasification, oxygen for capturing carbon emissions, electronic gases for thin-film solar, and we remain committed to our goals of improving margins and returns, while pursuing these opportunities. While the global economy is still not out of the woods, we are excited about the opportunities and challenges we face in 2010. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Carey to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions). And we will take our first question from Kevin McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy -- Merrill Lynch: Yes, good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning.
Nelson Squires: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy -- Merrill Lynch: Yes, on the joint ventures, Paul, it looks like you are seeing continued improvement there based on quarterly numbers. Can you comment on whether your outlook for the non-consolidated financials is similar to your remarks for the consolidated results?
Paul Huck: Yes, they are, Kevin, pretty much, yes. It goes according to regions there, but we have all the regions of the world, so yes.
Kevin McCarthy -- Merrill Lynch: Okay. Then on Merchant Gases, can you comment on the price outlook there, in particular it looks like Asia led slightly off about 2% year-over-year. How would that look on a sequential basis and perhaps you could comment on your recent price increases and what kind of success you might be seeing there.
Paul Huck: Nelson, do you want to take that?
Nelson Squires: Yes, hi, Kevin, this is Nelson. Let me maybe walk through region by region to cover that. In North America, we did launch a price increase effective October 1, and we are pleased with the results so far. Obviously, it is still early, but the early returns are favorable there. And so we expect pricing to be probably flat to up a bit in North America for the fiscal year. In Europe, we actually do expect pricing to be up. We're taking a number of actions there on a country by country basis, some of it tied to higher power, but we are trying to take advantage of certain situations to get price up and so we expect price to be positive in 2010 in Europe as well. In Asia, and by the way, on a sequential basis, probably flat this on a price basis. We probably will see pricing be flat to slightly down as assets continue to get loaded in the region. Now, we're not too concerned about that, but net on that, we expect pricing to be a slight positive in Merchant in fiscal 2010.
Kevin McCarthy -- Merrill Lynch: Okay, and the final question, if I may. On Electronics and Performance Materials. Did I hear you right, Paul, that you are targeting a 15% operating margin there in 2011, and if that is correct, maybe you could elaborate on how much of the incremental improvement might be derived from cyclical recovery versus your restructuring actions and other factors?
Paul Huck: Yes, Kevin, and we are targeting for the margin to be at 15% and 2011. If we look at sales in that area from a volume basis, we do not expect our volumes to recover to the 2008 levels until 2012. So there is a portion of this which depends upon the cycle coming back, but they do not need to get fully back as far as volume is concerned. So the majority, when you look at the numbers here, for our margin improvement from the restructuring actions which we are taking.
Kevin McCarthy -- Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank: Thank you, good morning.
Paul Huck: Hi, Dave.
David Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank: Hey, Paul, can you discuss your leverage to a stronger-than-expected recovery in global manufacturing, perhaps every 1% change and how that impacts your earnings?
Paul Huck: Sure. If we take a look at the leverage on our manufacturing from a company standpoint, Dave, you have to look at the right segments there. So the equipment and energy segment really doesn't have a lot of exposure to that, it is going to be more on the capital cycle. On the Tonnage business, I don't have a lot there either. So it really gets down into the Merchant and the Electronics and Performance Materials business. And if you look at just the way those volumes are going to grow in those areas, they are going to grow two times the underlying growth rate in those sectors in the manufacturing sectors there. So I would anticipate that we have -- you know, we have about $5.5 billion in sales there and you can do that at a 35% margin or so and you will come up with for every 1% growth, probably somewhere between $0.08 to $0.10.
David Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank: That was very helpful. Thank you. And just in Electronics, what is the 2011 operating margin you believe will occur in Electronics?
Paul Huck: 15%.
David Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank: I am sorry, I meant 2010.
Paul Huck: 2010? 2010 is going to be held down a little on the restructuring costs side with those things. So I think that we will not see as big of a recovery as far as the overall operating margin is concerned in that. If you take a look for the year, we finished in operating margins in Electronics and Performance Materials, Dave, at about 11.3% and so we might get up to -- in the 12.5% range in 2011.
David Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank: And Paul, how would you characterize the levels current bid activity in the Tonnage business?
Paul Huck: Level activity is still strong. We continue to work on a number of projects. The one thing which I will say and I have said this before is that the award activity is not as strong as the bid activity. So there is a lot of people out there, but the final awards continue to be delayed and pushed out a little bit. But people are still working on them, so the basic drivers, which are energy, are people looking for the same energy costs or improve energy efficiency, improve performance, those things are still there. It is just the people being sure that they can go out and spend the capital.
David Begleiter -- Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov with Barclays Capital.
Sergey Vasnetsov -- Barclays Capital: Good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning, Sergey.
Sergey Vasnetsov -- Barclays Capital: Your volumes declines impacted your results negatively by in 2009. Hence I'm just curious, what kind of expectation of recovery of this lost profit do you expect in 2010 and 2001? How soon do you expect to catch up all of this loss?
Paul Huck: As far as volume declines, as far as overall, Sergey, it depends upon the region. I think in Asia we are going to see us back by 2011, pretty much in volume. Late 2012 for the US and North America and in Europe, well out there. It may be 2013, 2014, as we look at the growth here.
Sergey Vasnetsov -- Barclays Capital: Okay. Secondly, what I didn't see in this press release, in the past week you have mentioned your 17% margin goal. Is it still out there for the ?
Paul Huck: Yes, it is still out there. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. It is still out there, it is out there for 2011, we are not backing that off and when we talk about our goal. And that, really as you know, that is really, as we are looking at this, we -- our actual goal here is to get our return on capital, keep improving our return on capital, we realize we invest a lot of money, we got to earn a good return on it.
Sergey Vasnetsov -- Barclays Capital: Of course, okay. And lastly, you talked about pension headwind a couple of times, but I don't think you have quantified it. Could you give us some range of impact?
Paul Huck: Yes, I did. In the pension headwind, it is about $0.15 a share year on year. And that really comes from -- just so everyone knows, it comes from the -- on the discount rate. The discount rate which we are going to use this year is probably around 5.7%, last year was about 7.5% and the liability just grew and so the way the economy works, the pension expense goes up.
Sergey Vasnetsov -- Barclays Capital: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John Roberts -- Buckingham Research: Good morning, guys.
Paul Huck: Hi, John.
John Roberts -- Buckingham Research: When you look at the quarter to date releases that you had back in July and August, Merchant gases look like they were down 8% and 10% back in July and August, but you were down more than that for the quarter, so it looked like the comparison at least was lower in September. Did the comps get more difficult or --?
Paul Huck: Well, a thing which you always have to look at that, you have to get to the underlying factors here, as far those are concerned. And September was a good month for us against prior year, I do not think that it got worse underlying there. I know it did not get worse underlying.
John Roberts -- Buckingham Research: Because again, I think the numbers were down 8% and 10% July and August, you were down 15% for the year -- full quarter versus a year ago, but we will go back and look at the numbers I guess.
Paul Huck: Yes.
John Roberts -- Buckingham Research: Nothing deteriorated as you said in the quarter.
Paul Huck: Yes, the other factor which gets in there is what was happening to the dollar on that thing too, and so that is the other factor which I would like to take a look at there.
John Roberts -- Buckingham Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Fred Seymour with Seymour Management.
Fred Seymour -- Seymour Management: Yes, hi, fellows. I was wondering about if you were -- productivity gains in the merchant gas business given the very difficult operating environment in the last year. I wonder, what was your improvement year to year in Merchant Gases for the variable margin and how much of that was due to positive selling prices, how much do lower electric power costs and natural gas costs and when you net net this all out, did you achieve any productivity gain?
Paul Huck: Yes, Fred, we achieved a significant amount of savings on our fixed cost base on things.
Fred Seymour -- Seymour Management: I am talking a variable margin.
Paul Huck: You are talking variable margins and productivity there. We did not -- I'll tell you honestly, we saw some on the distribution end, on the operations end as far as electric power costs and where we had to operate, no, we didn't see a loss on that area, because of the way the plants operate and you are familiar with that, of the turnouts of the things, but we did not -- so we got a little squeezed there. We did see savings on how much product we ran around and how we used our fleet. We did see significant savings on the cost base also, which we would not anticipate having to add back to as we load the plants.
Fred Seymour -- Seymour Management: And just one other little minor thing. What is the capacity in single tray capacity, you say you have the largest cold box you ever built, what are you up to, 3,300 tons per day?
Nelson Squires: It is even bigger than that, Fred, this is Nelson. This is about 3,700 tons.
Fred Seymour -- Seymour Management: Thank you.
Operator: Moving on to Don Carson with UBS.
Don Carson -- UBS: Thank you. Paul, a question on currency. It seems just again and looking at the quarter results with the currency, moving your favor in September just based on where you were in July, August, but you seem to have a rather conservative outlook for what impact it might have next year when you see -- traded through 150 today for example. Are you just take a more cautious view on the dollar or is it -- more offsetting expenses?
Paul Huck: And Don, no. And what I do is I tend to be conservative on these things, as far as the currency is concerned, we kind of use a rate that exists at the end of the quarter and we use that for our forecast. Trying to forecast this stuff is that you know very hard for that thing. So obviously, if the dollar strengthens, as we all know, and that is going to help us, that helps our earnings.
Don Carson -- UBS: You mean be offset if the dollar weakens?
Paul Huck: You know, I am sorry. Yes, offset if the dollar weakens, yes, I misspoke, Don, thanks. Thanks for catching that.
Don Carson -- UBS: A couple of questions on Tonnage. What was the PUI impact in the quarter and what is the outlook for that business in 2010 and what are your overall dark scan loadings. I would think you could get quite a pick-up there from higher industrial production.
Paul Huck: Yes, if you take a look at the PUI business, the PUI business operated well in this quarter, so we had -- and good results from that. Probably the one thing which it gets offset throughout the whole company is at the end of the year, as you know, we are on LIFO and we take and we value our inventory. The PUI business took a pretty big hit on inventory. You know, on the revaluation, which took the results of that business down, but the volumes were solid. Now, for the whole world company, it is a zero impact on the inventory revaluations. But that was a thing which held down the results in that area. If we look at things like -- if we look at dock scan loading, yes, there is still some upside to that -- particularly in steel and chemicals for us. On the refinery hydrogen side, obviously there isn't, but that is not boxed in.
Don Carson -- UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Sison with KeyBanc.
Mike Sison -- KeyBanc: Hey, guys. Paul, you were somewhat cautious in your commentary for the economic recovery, I understand that. As to some degree is adjusting the consumer could be a little bit sluggish. I'm just curious, you know the outlook for the silicon process to be up 15% next year, can you give us a little bit of help, sort of in the low growth scenario, why that would rebound pretty strongly?
Paul Huck: Well, I think it would and the reason why is that if we look at a drop somewhat, so if you go to that from start on the third slide, Mike, you see how much he dropped, and then it comes back up. It has been a couple of quarters, and pretty low. And so, with those couple of quarters pretty low, you don't have to have a lot of growth sequentially to really make that -- and to get to the kind of 15%. The other thing is inventory, yes. And that big drop which was there was actually the inventory correction which occurred. It occurred in a couple of quarters. I mean, and we think that that -- and that is worked through. So I don't think that they're going to sell all that much more, I don't think the consumer is going to buy all that much more. But one of the things is that they did it in our fiscal year, and this may not be true if you went to a 2009 calendar year 2010 calendar year, but in our fiscal year, we saw the corrections hit us a lot there.
Nelson Squires: One other comment, Mike, is on inventory. As we would also suggest that based on the date that we are looking at is levels are actually still dropping. So there still appears to be the ability to rebuild over the next couple of quarters.
Mike Sison -- KeyBanc: Okay, so you do see some restocking efforts and so you're sort of feeling that from customers heading into the fourth quarter and may be the first quarter of 2010.
Nelson Squires: I don't know if I am -- I think that is an upside. For me, I think people -- what they are trying to do here and my comment here I don't think is cautious as prudent, is that people are trying to match -- I tried to take -- and take the demand and match production to demand. They are trying to figure out what their demand is and match production to demand and once they get the level of inventory for them at the level that they want to. They're not looking to rebuild inventories a lot. I would not expect to see that.
Mike Sison -- KeyBanc: So, shifting gears a little bit, when I think about your guidance for 2010 and sort of walk through that earnings walk that you gave us, you sort of get to the bottom end of the guidance with cost savings on-site and I am assuming that the on-site or the tonnage project coming on stream represent 3% to 4% type of top line growth, right, and then, to get to the high end of 490, you need another 3% to 4% sort of top line growth to get there. Is that how the demand sort of works?
Paul Huck: Yes, I think that you know, it is probably 3% to 4% would be a reasonable number. It might be up to 5%.
Mike Sison -- KeyBanc: To get to the high-end?
Paul Huck: To get to the high end, right, Mike.
Mike Sison -- KeyBanc: Okay, and then, last question. In terms of where your refinery business, I think Nelson you suggested it was better sequentially and tonnage. You know, I just want a little bit of color what you thought about that heading into 2010 on the basis, its not new stuff coming on stream. You see refinery margins and operating rates in the US, really not that great, so I just wanted to get a little bit of color of how it did and the outlook.
Nelson Squires: Yes, Mike, I will add some more comment to that. This is Nelson. They did continue to stay positive in the fourth quarter versus prior year. So we really saw that in all four quarters. We think ex the new capacity that is coming on and if you look at just the base business as you suggested, we think things are awfully stable next year in that business. I don't think we're going to see a tremendous amount of growth. We are not anticipating miles driven to go up substantially next year, you know, as the economy does improve, the expectation would be that there is more diesel fuel or maybe more gasoline consumed, but I think it is only incremental. You know, one of the things we continue to see though and this is a positive thing for us and for the hydrogen supply is that the refineries that have done the conversion to a high conversion refinery, so focus on our transportation fuel are the refineries that are running the hardest. The ones that have not done the conversion are the ones that are dragging down the overall rates and we think that trend will continue going forward.
Paul Huck: And that is because the margins of the high conversion refineries are better than the margins of the low conversion refineries for every barrel of input.
Mike Sison -- KeyBanc: Got you. Great, thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Steve Shuman from Lafayette Research.
Steve Shuman -- Lafayette Research: Good morning, guys. John alluded to some comments in the press release, particularly about how you have got a new low cost structure that enables you to go faster than competition. Could you talk about that a little bit?
Paul Huck: Yes. It gets and the reductions in cost which was done this year, the reductions which was done in fixed costs, the reductions which we are making in our structure of management around here, we have made some significant cuts there, taken a number of people out, we're also making cuts in our capital expenditures as far as how much it costs to produce a ton of oxygen or a ton of nitrogen with capital and then the costs aren't variable. The whole goal of us being low cost really is to beat the competition and that is why we are doing it.
Steve Shuman -- Lafayette Research: (inaudible) been some technology breakthrough that would everybody out (inaudible).
Paul Huck: It has been a journey in which we have been on for a long time. John has emphasized it a lot with the management team around here and so it is a constant theme which we talk to our employees about, how it gives us a competitive advantage.
Steve Shuman -- Lafayette Research: Great. And are there any contracts on take or pay minimum or have you moved off all those?
Paul Huck: And there are still some, yes.
Steve Shuman -- Lafayette Research: Do you have a many percentage or a dollar value?
Paul Huck: I don't have a percentage. I never had that many to begin with because of the refinery comment, which you just made because two thirds of our business is refinery in the Talladega and so those where stayed above.
Steve Shuman -- Lafayette Research: Great, thank you.
Paul Huck: yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas -- J.P. Morgan: Hi, good morning. A few questions. Your depreciation in the fourth quarter was 225 and in the second quarter was 197. Why does it bounce around so much and what is the D&A number for next year?
Paul Huck: The D&A number for next year is probably going to be somewhere around 900 or so for us here. One of the things which bounces around is currency for us and new plants coming on stream. So you have to look at the currency rates, because a lot of the stuff around there. And so that decides the factor.
Jeff Zekauskas -- J.P. Morgan: Secondly, you are supposed to pull out $110 million in costs, and this year your SG&A was about 943. So is the 943 grew at -- I don't know, 3%, that is $28 million. So, all things being equal, should your SG&A be down in absolute terms next year?
Paul Huck: And once again, you have to pay attention to what happens on the currency rates of that. That does influence GAAP over -- 60% of my business overseas for us here. I think the way in which I try to look at SG&A is take it as a percent of sales, Jeff, and that is the best way and so we continue to drive it down. We drove it down this quarter. So as we go and reload, my whole goal is to get it right now below 10%.
Jeff Zekauskas -- J.P. Morgan: Okay. Are there any nonrecurring charges that you will take next year, and if so, what is the magnitude?
Paul Huck: There are not any large charges for things we do have some costs on the restructuring site, which are really accruals which we will be making for -- on plant closures by accelerating the depreciation and incurring the cost of the people for that. It is not a huge impact for us, as far that is going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Mike Harrison -- First Analysis: Hi, good morning. In the Tonnage business, you were showing a year-over-year decline in volume as of the August sales update that you guys and now you are showing a 4% year-over-year increase for the quarter. I was wondering if you could walk through how much of that improvement in the month of September was related to prior year weakness and obviously you also had some hurricane impact in there. And then how much maybe was related to new projects that came on stream during September and how much was related to other underlying economic improvement?
Paul Huck: Mike, the big factor there was the -- and was on the hurricane there in September. I had an easy comp in that period for us. If we look at -- if we take the hurricane -- and the hurricane out, we were about even as far as the volumes overall.
Mike Harrison -- First Analysis: Okay. And in terms of sort of the longer term outlook on the Tonnage business, one of your competitors at one point voiced some concerns about commodity weakness and maybe some over capacity in areas like metals, chemicals, and refining, and talked about that potentially being a drag on longer term growth in Tonnage projects. Since then they suggested that on their end those concerns may have waned a little bit. And I was wondering to the extent that your Tonnage business is dependant on growth in those markets.
Paul Huck: Well, I think the factor which you need to consider is the way industrial -- and gases are used. They save energy in the processes of these making these commodities, they improve the environmental performance. So I think that’s the driver which a lot of people have missed on that thing. So, yes, there are going to be some changes and maybe commodities don’t grow as quick, but there is always those -- but those things are the things, which we want to do.
Mike Harrison -- First Analysis: And then I was also wondering if you could comment on the minority interest line this quarter being zero. That seems unusual for you guys.
Paul Huck: Yes it was. We had a couple of -- if you take a look at the ventures in some of the ventures the profits were -- and were not as good. And these are things which are consolidated, so some of the -- some other things are there. The other factor is we had a few adjustments in things like in the -- in some of the ventures there. But it normally goes between $3 million to $5 million a quarter.
Mike Harrison -- First Analysis: And that’s a good run rate going forward?
Paul Huck: Yes, it’s a good run rate.
Mike Harrison -- First Analysis: Alright, thanks, Paul.
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.
David Manthey -- Robert W. Baird: Hi, good morning. I was wondering in terms of the revenue sequentially, it looked like they were up about 8%, driven entirely by volume for the most part with a contribution margin that was approximately 20% versus I think you had given guidance or at least a goal of sort of 30% to 40% as your volumes ramp up. Could you talk little about if there was mix impacting that contribution margin (inaudible)?
Paul Huck: Sure I can, yes. And if I look at the contribution margin for the fourth quarter, as we look at this, if I look at it on a volume basis, I had a contribution margin which was in the mid-30%. I did see some other things that were offsetting that and holding down, which lowered those things, such as the pricing in the Electronics specialty materials area. If you look at the -- on the Tonnage area, the bonuses I received in the fourth quarter were not as large as the bonuses I received in quarter three for these. So those things cut back on my contribution margins. Plus I had some -- a few issues on cost in the Merchant Gas area, which held down margins in that area so that overall the gains were not as large, overall, as what you would typically see. But I think a lot of those cost issues are one-time when we look at it and the issue on bonuses are up and down.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Gulley with Soleil Securities.
Mark Gulley -- Soleil Securities: Hey guys. I hesitate to pretend I'm an economist, but I can't resist. If I take a look at those very useful slides on page three, only a 1% gain in industrial activity next year would be 200 [ph] or thereabouts and clearly we saw a much better growth historically, running into the 2008 bubble. So, is it possible maybe you guys are being a bit too conservative on the bounce back from very depressed levels in 2009?
Nelson Squires: You know, Mark, and what I hope is that I hope I am right. You know, actually, I hope you are right on that. I am going to be prudent at this point in time I think on that and I don’t want to go out and say well I think the economy is going to go -- is going to be -- and real, real strong for that because I have the capacity to serve all this. It doesn’t serve the purpose of the Company to put plans in place for a stronger bounce back at this point in time.
Mark Gulley -- Soleil Securities: Okay, secondly, you were talking about Tonnage trends before overall and you talked about ex-hydrogen. If we take a look at steel and chemicals, what kind of reductions in Tonnage volumes did you see there when you exclude hydrogen?
Paul Huck: You are talking year-over-year?
Mark Gulley -- Soleil Securities: Year-over-year, principally in your Tonnage business--
Paul Huck: About -- and 10% or so.
Mark Gulley -- Soleil Securities: Okay. Makes sense. And the finally, talking about the streamlining, restructuring that has begun some years ago, I would have thought that maybe you would be done by now with Electronics, but it sounds like some of the restructuring activities continue to leak into fiscal 2010. What is holding back your ability to kind of get that behind us and so we can get these restructuring charges behind us as well?
Paul Huck: Well, as you know, we have a large Electronics business, it touches a lot of -- we have a lot of facilities in this company, we are making a lot of changes in that business. And those involve the products, which go to the customers, so it takes us some time to make sure the quals get all in for the customers. We don’t leave -- want to leave our customers hanging out on that. And that’s the thing, which really, and paces the changes here.
Mark Gulley -- Soleil Securities: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: Yes, good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: You know given the solid recovery in Electronics based on your chart on page three here or slide three, I was surprised to see that your Electronics revenues were up only 3% sequentially. Is there a lag, can you talk about that?
Paul Huck: What you don’t have is you don’t have quarter four on there yet as far as that. We did talk about the specialty materials sales, which were up 14% quarter-to-quarter, which is the big thing, which is going to vary with production, P. J. So there -- it’s on there. So the -- and then the thing which was down from quarter three to quarter four was the equipment sales. They continue to go down.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: Or when you look at your NF3, WF6, and other specialty products, how much were the sales up in the quarter sequentially?
Paul Huck: 14%. From quarter three to quarter four, they were up 14%.
P.J. Juvekar – Citi: And so when you say your Electronics volumes were -- or sales were up 3%, what are you talking about there?
Paul Huck: I am talking about -- no, no, no. No, what I am talking about are the specialty material sales, which are about 60% of the business, and the Tonnage Gas area, which is about a quarter of the business, and the other 15% of the business is the Equipment.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: Okay.
Paul Huck: And so you have to blend them all together. The Tonnage was about flat.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: Okay.
Paul Huck: Alright.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: And then sequentially, your organic sales were up 7% for the entire company and operating income was also up 7%, so we didn’t see much operating leverage going from 2Q to 3Q -- sorry, 3Q to 4Q in your case.
Paul Huck: Right. And that was the comment in which I gave before on that is that we did see the operating leverage, we had some things which offset that as far as things are concerned. I saw the operating leverage which I was expecting to see. It was offset by some unfavorable cost things in the Merchant Gas area, which we hope will reverse and not recur. About two-thirds of them we think are one-time. And then we had some -- in the Tonnage Gas area we saw a drop in -- on the bonuses. And those are lumpy, anyway.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: Okay.
Paul Huck: Okay.
P.J. Juvekar -- Citi: And then one last thing. Given that your CapEx is going up in 2010, what are your expectations for free cash flow next year?
Paul Huck: My -- P. J., my CapEx is about flat to slightly down is what I am predicting now, $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion compared to $1.5 billion. You have to go to our non-GAAP measure on that because of the capital lease treatment, which some of our on-sites get. But the -- and the free cash flow should improve in 2010.
Operator: The next question comes from Edward Yang from Oppenheimer.
Edward Yang -- Oppenheimer: Hi, good morning.
Nelson Squires: Hi.
Paul Huck: Hi, Ed.
Edward Yang -- Oppenheimer: Just to clarify, the 2010 EPS guidance, does that include the -- some of the restructuring costs you mentioned--?
Paul Huck: Yes it does. Yes it does.
Edward Yang -- Oppenheimer: And lastly on -- when I look at your Merchant Gases business, European volumes were down 9% year-over-year this quarter and in the third quarter they were down 8%. So it looked like European volumes actually got worse and I wanted to understand that better.
Nelson Squires: Most of that, Ed -- this is Nelson -- is really tied to the summer slowdown in August. The trends were actually probably good through the quarter and so nothing really unusual happened beyond the typical August shutdowns.
Edward Yang -- Oppenheimer: Okay. But wouldn’t the year-over-year numbers strip out the seasonality, Nelson?
Nelson Squires: No -- yes, they would. And that was a sequential comment. A sequential --
Edward Yang – Oppenheimer: Right. Yes, year-over-year it looked like was down 9% versus 8% last quarter. Was that just a matter of comparisons?
Nelson Squires: Yes, I don’t think there was anything unusual going on there. Part of that might be Healthcare volumes that were a bit higher, but nothing unusual from a (inaudible) standpoint.
Edward Yang – Oppenheimer: Alright. Thank you very much.
Nelson Squires: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander -- Jefferies: Good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning.
Laurence Alexander -- Jefferies: Two quick questions, one is on the Tonnage, the $0.35 from Tonnage in 2010, if you look at the timing of when those contracts come on stream, what is the contribution in 2011, is it really more around $0.50?
Paul Huck: No, it’s not. And we take a look at this, it’s over -- all of the segments on those things. It also includes some things, which came on stream in 2009. So there is a full year impact of that stuff also in there. And the thing which we are looking at is we are going to see an improvement in 2010 right now, which is probably -- which is -- excuse me, an improvement in 2011 right now from these, which probably goes somewhere in the $0.25 to $0.35 range.
Laurence Alexander -- Jefferies: Okay, perfect. And on pension, what was your funding status at the end of the year and what’s your long term strategy for fixing that?
Paul Huck: Well the -- and the strategy here is obviously is we are going to have to make some contributions. We have already made a contribution of $200 million to the -- and to the plans in October to (inaudible) that. Our funding status, it depends upon the way in which we look at this, because if you take the accounting definition, we believe that that always overstates that as we look at that and so the PDO right now is about $500 million of a liability for us.
Laurence Alexander -- Jefferies: Okay, and finally on--
Paul Huck: A net liability.
Laurence Alexander -- Jefferies: And finally you made your comment about how the holiday shutdowns weren’t going to be as severe this year. Are there particular end markets where you are seeing that or is that just across the board comment?
Paul Huck: That is a judgment on our part that people are being prudent in the production of their goods and services, right now. So we think that it goes across everybody and it is our judgment of how this plays out going forward.
Laurence Alexander -- Jefferies: Thank you.
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Squires for closing remarks.
Nelson Squires: Thanks, Carey. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00 PM today. Thank you for joining us and have a nice day.
Operator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation.

Your participation indicates your agreement.  Beginning today’s call is Mr. Nelson Squires, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Squires, you may begin.
Nelson Squires: Thank you, Vicky. Good morning and welcome to Air Products quarterly earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today CFO Paul Huck and I will review our fiscal 2009 third quarter results and outlook. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to www.airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 pm Eastern Time are also available on the website. Please turn to slide two. As always, today’s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of today’s earnings release. Before we get started, I want to point out one major change that we are making this quarter to our variance analysis and reporting. Energy and raw material cost pass-through will now include the cost of electric power pass-through contractually to Tonnage customers. This was previously included in our underlying sales variance, but we think that combining all cost pass-through will give better transparency on organic sales growth and margins. Now I’ll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks Nelson. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Now please turn to slide number three. I’d like to spend a few moments updating you on three items impacting this quarter’s results. First, as we indicated to you on last quarter’s call, given the continued decline in global economic activity and an expected reduction in new plan orders, we recorded an additional restructuring charge this quarter of $124 million or $0.39 per share.  About three quarters of this charge is for severance costs targeted at improving productivity, by further reducing costs related to operations, overheads, business development, project execution and infrastructure costs. The rest of the restructuring charge is for asset impairments associated with restructuring manufacturing capacity.  Our expected benefit in fiscal 2010 will be about $30 million, and the annual benefit in fiscal 2011 and beyond is expected to be $15 million. The previously mentioned annual savings do not reflect about $20 million of project execution costs, which get capitalized into projects. This savings will be reflected in lower future project costs.  This quarter’s provision excludes an additional $20 million to $30 million of restructuring and accelerated depreciation charges to be incurred over the next several quarters associated with these actions. These costs cannot be accrued for in this quarter’s charge as that associated assets are still being used.  These costs are for accelerated depreciation, related to the closure of our air separation manufacturing plant in the U.K. and electronics asset consolidation. These costs will be included on our EPS guidance as we provide updates. Our guidance for the next quarter includes approximately $8 million of these costs. Second, we recorded a supplemental pension plan settlement charge of $8 million or $0.02 per share for a number of our senior managers who retired recently. Third, we took a charge related to a large customer bankruptcy in the amount of $22 million during this past quarter. A bankruptcy court indicated that collection of certain receivables is unlikely. We also took other asset actions of $10 million for closure of several manufacturing facilities. Turning to slide number four, I’d like to take a few minutes to update you on the electronics business review we undertook during this quarter. We are of course encouraged by the sequential improvement in Electronics Materials volumes as we indicated in today’s results.  Customer run rates have improved substantially from the lows we experienced in our fiscal Q2. While that is good news, demand is still significantly below last year. Our previous actions to improve this business and reduce its cyclicality did not do enough to shield us from the impact of this downturn.  From this review we concluded that the business is still attractive and that we can achieve our margin and return targets. It was clear however, that we had to take additional actions to further simplify the business and reduce the variability in our results.  Here are the actions we have taken as part of the restructuring charge announced today. Please note that, as I mentioned earlier, there will be some additional costs over the next year as we continue to execute this plan. The Electronics P&L will absorb a large portion of these additional costs.  We have further streamlined and consolidated the organization. Actions taken this year will reduce headcount by approximately 20%. We have re-segmented our customers to better match service levels to customer needs and what they are willing to pay for. We have refocused our technology spending away from long term development, to focus on closure and projects with an emphasis on working with customers and OEMs. We believe this reduces risk and provides a higher return and provides for more growth in the future. We have ongoing opportunities for optimizing asset utilization by consolidating production capabilities and standardizing our packaging. The timing of these actions is asset specific, driven by both customer and supply chain considerations. Collectively, these actions have reduced our fixed costs and will further streamline our supply chain, while increasing our capabilities in Asia and our focus on emerging markets such as thin film solar that will deliver profitable growth in the future. In summary, we remain confident in the long term growth opportunities and electronics. We believe we can achieve a low cost business model with increased ability to flex our costs. This will reduce the variability of our margins and returns. It is our goal to complete these changes in 2010 and achieve our 15% margin target in the business in 2011. Moving onto our financial results for fiscal Q3, please turn to slide number five. Sales of $2 billion declined 11% versus prior year, excluding currency and energy pass-through impacts. Underlying business was all primarily due to lower volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials and Merchant segments and to a lesser extent, our Tonnage Gas segment.  Sequentially, underlying business was modestly higher on volume recovery in our Electronics and Performance Materials segment. Nelson will walk you through the details by segment shortly.  Consolidated operating income declined by 22%, driven primarily by the lower volumes and unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by lower operating and overhead costs. Our cost reduction actions continue to improve results. Our operating margin of 15.6% improved 130 basis points versus last year, due to our cost management actions and energy cost pass-through impacts, despite the decreased volumes. We increased our operating margin by 230 basis points sequentially, mainly from higher Electronics and Performance Materials volumes and better cost performance.  For the quarter versus prior year, our income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share decreased by 24% and 22%, respectively. Return on capital employed came in at 11%. Now, turning to slide six for a review of the factors that affected the quarter’s performance in terms of earnings per share, excluding discontinued operations and the Q3 disclosed items, our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.30 per share or 22% versus last year. Lower volumes accounted for $0.47 of the year-on-year decline. Pricing and energy and raw materials together were favorable, adding $0.06 and lower costs contributed an additional $0.20. The unfavorable impact to operating income from currency translation in foreign exchange was $0.09. Equity affiliates were down $0.06. Several factors drove our equity income lower this quarter. Last year’s results included some favorable US GAAP adjustments, which account for about a third of the decline, other factors including unfavorable currency impacts and lower volumes, particularly in Italy. Lower interest expense, due mainly to lower rates added $0.04. Fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.02 and the impact of a modestly higher tax rate was mostly offset by lower minority interest. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson.
Nelson Squires: Thanks Paul. Please turn to slide seven, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of $883 million, down 19% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 9% with volumes down 11% and pricing adding 2%. Currency reduced sales by 10%. Sequentially, Merchant Gases sales increased 1%, volumes were down 1%, pricing declined 2% and currency increased sales by 4%.  LOX, LIN system loadings for the quarter were in the low 70s, with North America and Europe essentially flat and Asia higher versus prior quarter. The sequential drop in pricing was primarily due to fuel surcharges imposed during last year’s surge in diesel prices that have run their course. Merchant Gases operating income of $169 million was down 17% versus prior year and up 8% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.1% was up versus prior year and sequentially, due to continuing cost performance improvement. Let me now provide a few comments by region; please turn to slide eight.  In North America sales fell 16% versus prior year, driven by the slow manufacturing climate. Volumes were down 19% versus prior year, while price added 3%. We saw lower argon and distributor sales again in the quarter. We are encouraged by the amount of new business signings, which improved versus Q2 and represented our best performance this fiscal year. In Europe sales decreased 21% versus prior year, primarily due to currency down 16%. Underlying sales declined 5%, with volumes down 8% and pricing adding 3%. Volumes were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment, but helped by stronger healthcare sales. Signings in Europe improved over Q2 levels and continued to remain ahead of plan for the year. In Asia, Merchant sales were down 16% versus last year, with currency reducing sales by 7%, underlying sales declined 9%. Volumes improved off the Q2 lows, mainly due to improved electronics customer run rates. In addition, volumes in China increased 20% sequentially. Signings were in level with quarter two. Please turn to slide nine, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $565 million decreased 42% compared to last year. Energy and raw material pass-through decreased sales by 32%. Currency reduced sales by an additional 4%, volumes were off 6%. Refinery hydrogen volumes continued to be up versus prior year.  Excluding refinery hydrogen, Tonnage volumes versus prior year continued to be impacted by the operating rates of our steel and chemical customers, but were flat versus prior quarter. Also, a significant PUI customer was down for a large portion of the quarter. Sequentially, sales were down 10%, mainly due to lower energy and raw material pass-through, which reduced sales by 11%. Operating income of $88 million was down 30% versus prior year and 11% versus prior quarter. The year-on-year decline was due to strong overall volumes, spot sales and operating efficiencies in the prior year, while the sequential decline was due to the previously mentioned PUI customer outage and maintenance timing. Operating margin of 15.5% increased versus last year due to lower energy and raw material pass-through. Our key projects for fiscal 2010 continue to proceed inline with expectations. Please turn to slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $409 million were down 29% compared to last year. Volumes reduced sales by 24%; currency reduced sales by 3% and price was 2% lower. Electronic sales were down 35% compared to last year, but increased 21% sequentially, better than forecast due to improved customer run rates. The year-on-year decline reflects the significant downturn in semiconductor manufacturing.  Electronics specialty materials sales declined 36% versus prior year but increased 30% sequentially. Equipment sales declined 60% versus prior year. Performance Materials volumes declined 23% versus last year, but improved 26% sequentially, reflecting seasonal improvement and stronger Asian sales. Operating income of $39 million was down 45% versus prior year, but recovered well sequentially due to higher customer operating rates and better than expected cost performance.  Our Electronics business returned to profitability during the quarter and our Performance Materials results were also better than expected. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon process to be down about 40% in our fiscal 2009 versus our April prediction of about 35%. Industry CapEx is now expected to be down approximately 60% versus prior year.  The Electronics business has clearly bounced off the lows we experienced in our second quarter. That being said, our customers continue to take a conservative view towards their production and this is represented in our guidance. Please turn to slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $119 million increased 12% compared to last year, due to increased large air separation unit activity. Operating income of $13 million increased due to improved cost performance. Our backlog in this segment now totals $253 million. We recently announced the successful startup of the first APEX exchanger, in support of Qatargas 2 and we expect to see a new order for an LNG heat exchanger this year. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks Nelson. Now, if you will turn to slide 12, I’d like to share our outlook for Q4. We saw significant deterioration in the economy during the first half of fiscal 2009 and it would appear based upon the recent data and trends, that we found a bottom in fiscal Q2.  Looking to next quarter, specifically for each of our business segments, we expect our Merchant volumes to be inline with last quarter, with Europe continuing to deteriorate, partially due to summer holidays, but Asia continuing to improve. We don’t anticipate any significant change in the U.S. As one would expect, given capacity utilization rates in the low 70s, pricing on new business is proving to be more challenging, but we expect continued good cost performance. In Tonnage, we expect volumes will improve as capacity utilization rates creep higher in the steel and chemicals portion of the Tonnage segment. We also expect refinery hydrogen volumes to improve modestly from current levels across most of our pipeline franchises, due to higher demand and fewer customer outages. Also we expect higher polyurethane intermediate volumes. Higher operating bonuses and lower maintenance spending will help, and this segment should benefit from an asset sale next quarter. In Electronics and Performance Materials we expect that higher volumes will be offset by ongoing restructuring costs. In Equipment and Energy, we expect lower operating results due to ongoing restructuring costs. Our guidance for quarter four is for earnings per share of $1.04 to $1.14, which for the full year is $3.95 to $4.05 per share. With regard to capital spending, we still expect that fiscal 2009 will be about equal to fiscal 2008 spending of $1.4 billion and as we look to fiscal 2010, our initial forecast would be for flat to modestly lower capital spending.  We are currently working on our budget for 2010. Let me share with you some factors that will impact next year’s results. We expect to bring on new plants where the volume is already sold. This should add $0.30 to $0.40 per share for 2010. Our cost reduction efforts, with the additional actions should now add approximately $0.35 per share.  Ongoing restructuring costs should reduce profits by about $0.05 in 2010 and we would expect, that given the overall decline we have seen in this fiscal year in the market that our pension expense should be about $0.10 higher. While we are not done with our plans and we’ll have more to share with you at year end, we believe we are well positioned for attractive earnings growth in 2010, without a significant recovery in the economy.  In closing, our actions this quarter demonstrate our commitment to improve our margins and returns. The cost actions we are taking are not only to preserve our near term profits, but more importantly they also position us with the right cost structure for achieving our 17% margin goals as volumes recover. Thank you, and I’ll now turn the call over to Vicky to take your questions. 
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from John McNulty - Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: On the Electronics business, with the actions that you are taking, can you give us some color as to how your past quarter, the second quarter, which really came under so much pressure, what that would look like with the cost cuts that you are looking to pull in? How would the profitability improve?
Paul Huck: You are talking about on quarter two?
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Exactly.
Paul Huck: As far as quarter two is concerned, when we look at this, we are striving to take actions so that we do not drive ourselves into a loss and so that would be the thing that we think with the actions which we are taking here, that we could hopefully avoid a loss in this sharp downturn here; and also that we would be on average over this cycle, have returns which are well above our cost to capital.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. Then just a question on your big on-site project, some of them had been delayed. Have you seen any comeback, now that the credit crisis doesn’t seem quite as severe?
Paul Huck: We have not seen anybody come back on the projects which people have put off, our current projects are proceeding well and we told you that, but as far as the ones which have not started, we haven’t seen anybody start to come back on that. I think that’s a little bit early. I don’t think it’s a crisis of credit John, so much as people are looking, are they going to be able to sell the product. Manufacturing capacity operates at about 65% of global capacity today. So I think the push on new projects is going to be light over the next few years. I think the places in which we’re going to see, we’ve told this to people before is we still see the hydrogen projects going forward for the refineries to make the refineries a lot more competitive, that’s a case of their economics and improving their economics.  In China we still expect that, and manufacturing is picking up faster in China than any place else in the world and so as they build a chemical industry in the inland of China based upon coal, we still expect to see the gasification projects proceed.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Harrison - First Analysis
Mike Harrison - First Analysis : I was wondering if you could give us a few more details about the 2% sequential decline in Merchant Gases pricing. It sounded like part of that was related to the diesel surcharge, but if you could maybe talk about how much of that is related to surcharges going away or a decline in pass-through’s and how much of it might be related to contracts rolling over or new business signings that are coming in at lower pricing.
Nelson Squires: The majority of this is the surcharges rolling off. If you recall where we were a year ago, we had just faced a 30% increase over the stretch of about three weeks in diesel costs when we did this call and we were basically chasing the price of diesel all through last year. We put three surcharges into our customers and the whole purpose of the surcharge was we have to incur the difficulty or the problem before we can surcharge to, compensate for it and then the surcharges roll off as we basically have been compensated and have made up the difference and this is what has begun to happen. So, it is mostly attributable to that. We have not really seen any significant changes in pricing contract roles, but as Paul mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have seen some pressure on new business, but frankly, that really hasn’t impacted overall price all that much.
Paul Huck: Mike, I think a point here is that we have not seen a tremendous amount of pressure on price come out here. There aren’t any cost pressures right now pushing price up, but as far as the pricing, I think everyone understands you’re signing a five year contract here. So, if you want to load something for a year or two, it doesn’t make a lot of sense.  If you’re short on loading for a year or two, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to go out and offer a five year contract at a low price for us. It’s just not a good economic deal for us, and that’s the way we’re functioning here. As you can see, the business is performing very well, giving a good margin and a good return at these pricing levels, so we’re happy with it.
Mike Harrison – First Analysis: In terms of Merchants volumes down 19% in North America, can you walk through what you’re seeing in individual markets in North America and now that we are a few weeks into July, are you seeing any signs of sequential improvement in any of those markets?
Nelson Squires: It’s pretty much an across-the-board decline. In that two-thirds of the business that’s focused on manufacturing, remember, about a third of the business is focused on things such as food, hospital oxygen, etc., markets that don’t really change that much. So it’s a general decline. It’s nothing probably any worse than anything else. We continue to see lower argon volumes, and that’s putting a lot of pressure on the overall volume index and our third-party sales continue to be down, so our sales to distributors, etc. Obviously they’re in markets which are largely also manufacturing, have been hard hit. As we look forward, our expectations for Merchant in North America are flattish to slightly up as we go forward. Europe, we are still seeing declines, but the steepness of the decline is more limited now. The issue we have in Europe, of course is the summer holidays, which always slowdown our sales in Europe. Asia though continues to look good as we roll into the quarter and continues a nice steady improvement.
Mike Harrison – First Analysis: Last question I had was on Electronics and Performance Materials pricing. I was wondering if you could breakout how much of that year-over-year decline was Electronics and how much was Performance Materials and also wondering if you could talk specifically about what you are seeing in pricing for fluorine-based gases like NF3.
Paul Huck: Mike, the decline was all Electronics on the pricing there year-over-year and we are still seeing pressure on prices on the fluorine-based gases. Realize though, that this is something which has been a long term trend for us and we have been able to counteract that by our cost reductions.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Begleiter – Deutsche
David Begleiter - Deutsche: Paul, on Electronics, how much smaller will the business be post the restructuring, and how much in sales did you find during the review that didn’t make much or any money? 
Paul Huck: Yes Dave, I don’t think it’s going to be a lot smaller. I don’t think we found a lot of things and which would go out here as far as that is concerned. The main thing here is structured around the cost portion of the business for us and really taking advantage of the downturn to consolidate operations, consolidate production facilities, etc. the reductions in staff which we have put in. So we have a lot better cost base today to respond and we’ll improve upon that as we take the actions in 2010.
David Begleiter - Deutsche: Paul, on Q4 guidance, it was reduced by about $0.02 to $0.03 versus the last call. What were the main drivers of that reduction? 
Paul Huck: That would be the top end of the guidance, when you actually look at that. If you are going to the top end of our guidance if you went there, I don’t think it’s really anything which gets at actually a reduction. It’s probably the variability in the third quarter isn’t as much there.  As far as the low end of our guidance, Dave as we look at this, the thing which we are concerned about is if the Electronics dips back down. We hope that isn’t true. Our volume trends through the first 20 days or so would say it’s not true in outward things and so as we continue to look, we think that we’re still pretty solid as far as the results are concerned.  The recovery is slow; realize that. I mean everyone should understand that we are not seeing a huge strong recovery anywhere. In the US, the package on the stimulus really isn’t having an impact for things, but overall I think we’re performing well and we think we’ve done a good job of matching costs and volume here going forward. 
David Begleiter - Deutsche: Paul, lastly, what was the PUI impact in the quarter on Tonnage volume? 
Paul Huck: Yes; the PUI impact of that customer being down was a couple of cents for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: In the release this morning you reiterated your commitment to a 17% margin goal. I was wondering if you could walk us through how you get there, relative to the year-to-date average of 14% in last year’s 14%, number one. Then number two, comment on when you might be able to achieve that; would it be feasible in 2011, for example?
Paul Huck: Well Kevin, first I think the 17% margin goal and that is our goal for 2011, for us as we look at that. If you take a look at it, today we have done a lot to improve our margins and so, if we get to our margins of last year, we’ve already produced a point to a point-and-a-half of improvement. The bulk of that actually has come from cost reductions. We’ve had a negative impact from volumes and we’ve had a positive impact from gas coming off, but roughly, if I were to walk you from today let’s say, it’s probably something which is an easier way to do it and let’s say we put gas at $6 or so, that probably puts us pretty close to a 15% margin as the company is concerned.  About half of the improvement comes from costs; that’s from today, improving my cost base, lowering my cost base by $80 million a year. So I’ve got those actions in place, with the cost reduction which we announced today and the continued and the impact of the rest of the cost reduction which we have going forward from quarter one, puts those actions in place and then a loading impact of about 1% as the volumes start to recover. That loading impact is about a 5% improvement in volume for us overall. So, it’s not a huge impact on volume and that quite simply is how we get there. 
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: A second question if I may on the Merchant business. Most companies are bemoaning the regional weakness in Europe. I think you’ve posted volume of negative eight there, much better than North America. The disparity seemed quite wide, even though I know you have healthcare in Europe. I was wondering if you could maybe update or elaborate on what you are seeing in merchants in Europe.
Nelson Squires: Healthcare in Europe did have a strong quarter and so that did mitigate a lot of the volume decline. I would also say probably that argon sales were not as weak as they were in North America, but most of the difference is attributable to a very good quarter in healthcare.
Operator: Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander - Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies: I guess the first question is on Electronics; could you walk through how you see the mix playing out over the next few years to get margins to 17%? That is, are you assuming a sustainable increase in equipment margins or what kind of levers.
Paul Huck: Lawrence, just thing, you said the thing which we are striving for is 15% in 2011; 17% I just answered and that was overall for the company, but as far as trying to get to the margins of 15% in Electronics, the things as we look at that is the mix of business, it’s probably not going to change a lot from today as far as we look at that. We are about a quarter Tonnage; 15% or so Equipment; and 60% in the Specialty Materials for that. So with that mix, we can get there. What this does is that we will have some volume recovery. You’ve seen that and you’ve seen the nice impact of volume recovery. We are still well below the volumes of the prior year, but you’re seeing a very strong impact. So, if we were at the prior year volumes, our margins and earnings would be above our 15% today for us. I do not have to get all the way back to the volumes of 2008 to get there, and so I can get there with some volume recovery and the cost actions which we have put in place here.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies : Then in Tonnage, how much was the hit in the quarter from maintenance timing on your margins?
Paul Huck: On the maintenance, was small about $0.01 or so... 
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies : And then lastly, for Merchant. Given the timing of the diesel surcharges rolling off and sort of the pushback from customers; is there a possibility that Merchant pricing could be negative in 2010? 
Paul Huck: If we take a look at that certainly, if diesel would continue to climb we could see pricing there. You realize that this is a surcharge which goes through and so all we are doing is recovering our cost here with our customer. We are not in here trying to make money on our customers on this thing. It really plays out as diesel prices play out.  The other thing which we have, pressure coming up is that power prices continue to rise and we have the right to surcharge for power prices, too. We’ve seen power price increases in Europe. We’re likely to see some power price increases in the U.S., as states like Pennsylvania go out and deregulate those things, so would put some pressures on, longer term.  I think the bigger thing which you really need to focus on here is our improvement in margins in this business. We are going to get this business above a 20% margin in the near term here.
Operator: Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar - Citi.
PJ Juvekar – Citi: Quickly, on NF3; how low did the operating rates go? I know you shut down some Asian capacity for awhile. Can you update us on Asia as well as the hometown plant?
Paul Huck:  Right now, the Asian plant is not up yet, so we still have that upside for us to happen as we will bring it back on stream sometime in the near future here, PJ.
PJ Juvekar – Citi: So are you supplying Asia from the U.S.?
Paul Huck: Yes, we are.
PJ Juvekar – Citi: So you are going back to your old supply chain, and is that costing you incrementally?
Paul Huck: Yes, and that does add some costs to us, but realize we continue to work on lowering those costs and also continue to work on lowering the cost of the production in the U.S. here too, so it’s a constant drive to that. We still have a decent amount of capacity here in the U.S. and plan to have that capacity in the U.S.
PJ Juvekar – Citi: Second; sort of a housekeeping question. Why was the pension charge put into one time charge for the quarter? Why did you call that out?
Paul Huck: Because it was an unusual charge, it was a similar cost to what we had last year. It wasn’t as large, but we thought as far as trying to do it, it’s not something which actually recurs, it’s a thing which you trip.  With all the divestitures which we have, we have had a significant cut in the number of senior people at the company. So what that does is it produces these one time charges and also, we can’t accrue these charges at the time they occur. It occurs when the payments actually come, so they are not matched to the cost reduction timing. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: Finally; just the big picture question, the margin goes right goes to half for Air Products, or would you rather have return on capital or some other goals? Because your margins are impacted by this natural gas pass-through.
Paul Huck: Yes; I missed the first portion of that. 
PJ Juvekar – Citi: Are these margin goals, the right goals to have?
Paul Huck: Yes, they are, and the thing which I will tell you is that I do my margin goals. As I set these up, I put gas at $6. If you take a look at the segment of Tonnage Gases, that’s a hard one to get a margin goal in here, but when you look at this in the end, the margin goal is really being driven by our desire to improve our returns. Everyone focuses; the investor community has a lot of focus on margin. So, our focus, as you know here is very much on return and our goal in improving our margins really is to improve our returns. So, if I get to my margin goal, I should get my return on capital employed up to 15% at that point in time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas – JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas – JP Morgan : What’s the size of the gain that you intend to book in the fiscal fourth quarter on an EPS basis?
Paul Huck: Are you talking on the sale of assets? 
Jeff Zekauskas – JP Morgan : Yes, please.
Paul Huck: Yes, it’s about $0.02 or so, and so the reason we called those out is we have the ongoing cost of the restructuring, plus we have this one time gain. They are going to about offset, if we get the assets sold. 
Jeff Zekauskas – JP Morgan : Secondly, in response to some of the other questions about your sequential pricing, you’ve talked about how it’s really an answer to changes in diesel fuel prices. So, should diesel fuel prices stay relatively stable, then what we should expect for Air Products sequential pricing going forward, is that it remains flat. Is that correct?
Paul Huck: Yes. 
Jeff Zekauskas – JP Morgan : Lastly, if you look at the Merchant volumes in the United States for the last three quarters, the Merchant volumes have stepped down globally from 6 to 8 to 11. What do you make of that in general, Paul? That is, why should there be an acceleration in the decrease for an industrial gas company? Whereas it seems that on a relative basis the economy is more stabilized over that period of time.
Paul Huck: Yes, Jeff. That’s a good question. I think what you have to realize is that we were having growth during these periods. So, the first three quarters we had growth from year-to-year. So, it’s actually the comparison period. As we go into quarter four and as we go into next year, you are going to see a better comp which is an easier-to-beat number there for us. So, it’s just and lapping the growth here is what we are getting.
Operator: Your next question comes from Don Carson - UBS.
Don Carson – UBS: Just to follow up on merchant pricing, what impact does liquid argon have on the volume index? I’m trying to wonder what would that index be if you are just looking at LOX, LIN. Would that be somewhat muted and, Paul just wondering if you could clarify the comment again on pressure on new signings. How does the pricing on new signings in Merchant in the U.S. compare to your existing book? 
Paul Huck: If you take a look at the impact on pricing, whether its volume or price index in which we are looking at is LOX, LIN and so that’s going to be the one which has the biggest impact. LAR is going to be next and then followed by hydrogen and helium for us, but LOX, LIN is well above 50% of most of our sales there. So, that’s going to be the one which is going to dominate. Regarding the comment on pricing is that, as one would expect the business is a lot more competitive for things and so you are seeing more people show up to these things. People are taking their pencils out and trying to win business.  I will tell you, I’ll say this for ourselves here, we are being very careful because we like our prices today, we like our business today, we like the performance of our business. We are very happy, even with the performance, even given the fact that the loadings are in the low 70s.  I do not have an urgent desire to take business at a low price to increase my loadings. I don’t need to do that and I think the bulk of my competitors, as they’re reacting at that, haven’t shown a great desire to do that, either, for us. So, I do not think that there’s a huge issue here on pricing, it’s just that people should understand that pricing is still competitive at these rates.
Don Carson - UBS : You gave some comments on the 2010 outlook, more just looking at new plants and cost impacts. What would be the impact if global industrial production recovers? You’ve got some pretty low operating rates.  What kind of incremental operating margins would you see in both your Tonnage and Merchant business on a volume recovery next year?
Paul Huck: A good rule of thumb for us is anywhere from 35% to 45%. When I do large calculations, I use about 40%. The big impact on which we are going to see is Electronics, actually, I think, year-to-year right now. We went through a very low period in quarter two. So we are set up for a good comp here next year in quarter two of fiscal year for us, I think with the volume recovery which need, that sustained.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Paul, as you talked about all the restructuring actions that you’ve taken, one of the things you mentioned very quickly, was I think reflecting lower growth prospects going forward in Tonnage. I think you talked about reducing your project execution team and stuff like that. Can you elaborate on that a bit? Can you talk about whether or not you think the Tonnage business is going to face significantly lower growth prospects going forward, and that’s why you’ve taken these actions there?
Paul Huck: Certainly, as we’ve said, Mark there is lots of new bidding activity still out there, there’s lots of development activity still out there. The awards of orders have slowed down.  I made a comment earlier about refinery hydrogen and in China the oxygen for gasification of coal to chemicals; those things are still proceeding, all-be-it not at the same rates as what they were, but activity is slower for things.  We think, in the longer term, the growth drivers are still the same. Improved energy performance, improved environmental performances are still there for us to keep going. As production shifts to Asia, we see that as an opportunity for us to go and take advantage of that.  So, we do think that there’s a longer growth in the very near term, let’s say that’s the 2010, 2011, we think there could be some pressure on capital spending downward for us. If that happens, that’s cash for the shareholders, which is the nice thing about the industrial gas model.  The other factor here, Mark, and we continue to go out and look at it, I didn’t make a comment as we went through our results, but we continue to work on project acquisitions, and we think we have some real prospects here which would add very nicely and would give growth instantaneously. They would involve a cash outflow right away, and it wouldn’t be over two years, it would be a lumpy type of capital spends, but it would also put earnings right to the P&L pretty quick here.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Can you elaborate on the kind of acquisitions you are looking at?
Paul Huck: Well, there is acquisitions of plants which we have sold or other people have sold in the industrial gas space; of captive plants which people operate for themselves, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen plants, which these people operate for themselves and we would buy and put them on our pipeline systems in many instances or go in and take that position for them.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: If I may in housekeeping; tax rate cosmetically was low this quarter. What is the underlying tax rate for the quarter for this year and for next year?
Paul Huck: The underlying rate for this year is 26%. We’re not ready to give any guidance really for next year, but I don’t think it’s not going to change a remarkable amount, I don’t think, unless the laws change.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: You mentioned a couple of times your Merchant Gases capacity utilization is at about 70%. Any comments regionally U.S., Europe, Asia and also some changes in the freight?
Nelson Squires: Yes. You are saying capacity or system loadings by region, Sergey? Yes, this is Nelson. In North America they’ve probably ticked up a point or so, but still are in the low 70s and I’m really talking LOX, LIN here. As Paul said earlier, that really drives the system.  In Europe they probably ticked down a point or so, but remained in the low 70s and in Asia they’re up a fair amount; they’re probably up 10 points over where we were in the second quarter and so that takes again from the low 80s or the low 70s and probably to around 80% loading.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Also, your fiscal year is earlier than for most other peers by quarter, which means that you must be doing your strategic plan review and budgets for next year early as well. Today may not be the time for them to seek formal 2010 outlook, but maybe you can offer some quantitative comments on the pace of improvements you expect in your end markets and also your overall results?
Paul Huck: Yes, one of the things which I gave is, I gave an outlook on the budget here, which is about what we are comfortable at this point in time in sharing here for us, as far as the impact to the company, and we are set up for some good growth going forward here. We have the projects coming on stream with the full year impact of the cost reduction out there, which are going to drive the growth going forward, and so we think we’re positioned well. Overall, as far as the economy is concerned, I’m starting to feel a little bit better about the economy, certainly in Asia, and the U.S. seems to have bottomed here. Europe we think will probably bottom in the fourth quarter, but in the end, the thing which we’re planning for is a slow recovery. So we’re going to set our costs and all our plans based upon a slow recovery, to be conservative on here, because it’s a lot easier for us to adjust up than it is to adjust down.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Your comments on Merchant pricing were primarily describing what’s gone on here. I’m wondering whether in Europe, with the economy worse and the operating rates lower, could they be the lead indicator running into competitive pressures there?
Paul Huck: No, I don’t think. In fact, the prices in Europe are actually moving up here based upon power costs and things like that for us. So we have not seen issues in Europe as far as pricing is concerned here.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Okay. On your pension fund costs, in your presentation, did you say that you expect about a $0.10 headwind next year from pension charges?
Paul Huck: Yes, and that’s with where the markets are today and it’s a rough estimate at this point in time. We’ll see how it actually comes out and based upon that, because you do the valuation on 30 September year end, so it’s always a guess here. The things which Air Products didn’t have the last year is that in the markets were higher at the end of our fiscal year than the calendar year companies, so we could run into some of that headwind in this coming year.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Is it possible that you might have to make a contribution, and how would that impact your balance sheet by the end of next year and possible disposition of some of that cash flow, is it your own?
Paul Huck: Yes, Peter that’s certainly something which would be voluntary on our part, the contribution. We always look at the ability to make a contribution with tax benefits. We’ve talked a lot about that in past calls, as far as we manage it.  We would not be forced to make a contribution. Let’s say from a government standpoint of regulations and we are fine with that. So if we chose to make the contribution, it would be based upon it’s the right thing to do from managing the cash for the company as a whole for us going forward here.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward Yang - Oppenheimer.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer: A quick question, your net debt was up sequentially and the interest expense was actually down. I was wondering what was behind that and what you expect for the next quarter in terms of interest expense?
Paul Huck: Yes, the debt was up a little bit. I mean there is the impact of currency, rates are a little bit higher and that produced the bulk of the impact on debt. As far as the interest rates, the rates continue to be low in the short term here for us, so our CP is low here.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer: Paul, on Electronics and the 15% margin target, I think you had some restatements in the past, so we don’t have a lot of historical data on this, but when was the last time that segment, if ever had margins in that 15% range? I would like some historical perspective.
Paul Huck: Certainly in the 90s and the early portion of the 2000 decade we saw margins there above the 15% range. We got close in 2008, in that time period, to 15%, but a lot of things have changed in the business. We have changed a lot of things. We have made a lot of changes and substantial reductions in our staffing, substantial changes in our plants, in our product lines and how we do business here. So we’ve made a lot of changes to this business, and we feel confident that we can go forward here and achieve our margin target.
Edward Yang – Oppenheimer: Can you talk about the competitive landscape within that segment? You’re taking constructive steps with your cost basis. I would think that your competitors are probably doing the same as well. So are the lower margins in that Electronics segment just a function that it’s just much more competitive?
Paul Huck: Certainly there have been pressures on price, but realize that there’s been a lot of volume which has been pushed through this segment too, and so what that does, that changes the dynamics of it, of the business here. What that gives you is an opportunity and your customers expect that opportunity to take advantage of economies of scale.  That’s what we’re doing and we’ll continue to do, as we go forward here and realize that the positions which Air Products has in this business are very good. We are a leading supplier, if not the number one supplier in the bulk of the products in which we offer here.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Schuman - Lafayette Research.
Steve Schuman - Lafayette Research: One thing I’ve noticed with yourself and some of the other competitors is that the fall in income has been less than I would expect considering the fall in sales. Of course there are some put and takes with currency and pass-through, but is the bulk of that cost savings or are you still finding products that are at either zero or negative margin you’re able to remove from your sales picture?
Paul Huck: I think the bulk is actually going out in saving costs here, and continuing to reduce costs is something which we do on a constant basis. We do it in good times and in bad times.
Steve Schuman - Lafayette Research: So I guess, couple of years ago, you went through a product review on Electronics in particular, where you did remove a lot of the low or negative margin cost products. So that you say is pretty much done at this point?
Paul Huck: Yes, but I think the thing which people ought to realize, it wasn’t a huge amount of sales. It was probably $100 million a year in sales. So, when you put that over the size of Air Products, it’s not a huge impact. It helps, but it’s not a huge impact.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs.
Amy Zhang – Goldman Sachs: Good morning, this is Amy Zhang sitting in for Bob. I have two quick follow up questions. The first one, on the Electronics side, Paul or Nelson, can you give us a little bit more color on the magnitude of rebound across each of the three divisions there; Specialty Gases, Bulk Gases and Equipment. Also, what the quarter-to-date trends look like? 
Paul Huck: Yes Amy, the bulk of the change here and the rebound occurred on the Spec Gas and Chemicals side of this business. The Equipment business is still down and is going to remain down until capital spending comes back. Tonnage Gases is a stable business and we don’t see that moving a whole lot.
Amy Zhang – Goldman Sachs: Then the trend, the quarter to date, I guess rather consistent with whatever you saw in the June quarter right?
Paul Huck: Yes.
Amy Zhang – Goldman Sachs: Then second question on the cost of savings, you mentioned $0.35 per share in FY 2010 and then at the same time as you assume a modest economic recovery. I’m wondering, what’s the mix for this cost saving benefit between the variables and fixed?  If this global economy rebounds stronger or much stronger than you guys expected, what shall we expect as the cost of saving at the end of the day? Would that be reduced or how we should think about; how much of the savings is sticky?
Paul Huck: Amy, the cost savings which we talk about on the $0.35 a share is all fixed cost savings for us, that’s what we’ve been talking at. We continue to work on our variable costs, trying to drive that out by improving the efficiency of our plants, etc and the yields of our plants, but that’s a separate topic for us as we go forward here. I think, as far as a large rebound in the economy, it could require us to do something, but for right now I just don’t see that requiring us to be a lot, given our loadings on the system and things like that I would have to add a lot of fixed cost, even under a scenario where we got growth of 10%, let’s say.  You can see the loadings on the plant, so I don’t have to add manufacturing capacity, etc to respond to this. I’ve got about $2 billion in sales which is sitting unloaded at this point in time which we can grow back into. So that’s a good thing to have and a great opportunity for us.
Amy Zhang - Goldman Sachs: So the bottom line here is that $0.35 per share savings is safe and that’s regardless of the underlying economic environment?
Paul Huck: We should have that, right.
Operator: That is all the time that we have for questions today. At this time, I’ll turn things back over to Mr. Squires for any additional or closing remarks.
Nelson Squires: Thanks Vicky. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00pm today. Thank you for joining us and have a nice day.
Operator: That does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you all for joining.

Nelson Squires: Thank you, Jenny. Good morning and welcome to Air Products' quarterly earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today, CFO Paul Huck and I will review our fiscal 2009 second quarter results and outlook. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to air products.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call, beginning at 2:00 PM Eastern Time, are also available on the website. Please turn to Slide two. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of today's earnings release. Before we start, please note that today's comments on operating results will exclude last year's $26 million or $0.08 per share pension settlement charge. Details are included in the notes to the earnings release and our appendix slides. Now, I will turn the call over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks Nelson. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Now please turn to Slide Number three. As we indicated back in January, weak business conditions around the world have created a challenging business environment across our end-markets. As we expected, volumes were down significantly this quarter, as many customers ran at much lower operating rates. On a positive note, our volume trends did improve as the quarter progressed. Sales at $2 billion declined 11% versus prior year, excluding currency and natural gas pass through impacts. Underlying business was off primarily due to lower volumes in our electronics and performance materials segment and, to a lesser extent our Tonnage Gases segment. Volumes are lower in Merchant Gases but this decline was mostly offset by higher pricing. Sequentially, underlying business was down 4% on lower volumes across all segments except Equipment and Energy. Nelson will walk you through the details by segment momentarily. Consolidated operating income declined by 31%, driven primarily by the lower volumes and unfavorable currency. Our operating margin declined a 140 basis points versus last year, primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher prices and lower costs. Lower cost increased operating margin by 20 basis points sequentially even with the lower volumes. Despite lower than forecasted volumes, cost reductions moved earnings to the high side of the range and earnings beat expectations. Our cost reduction actions are having an impact. For the quarter versus prior year, our net income and diluted earnings per share decreased by 31% and 29% respectively. Return on capital employed fell to 11.7%. Now, let me turn to slide four and review the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. There were two items of note. In discontinued operations, we recognized a tax benefit related to the previously recorded healthcare impairment charge. This tax benefit added $0.08 per share in discontinued operations. And we had a pension settlement charge in the prior year that Nelson mentioned earlier. Excluding the discontinued operations and the prior year pension settlement charge, our adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.37 versus last year. Lower volumes accounted for $0.52 of the year-on-year decline. Pricing and Energy and raw materials together were favorable adding $0.13. Lower cost contributed an additional $0.12. The unfavorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.11. Accrued affiliated (ph) income declined $0.05 mainly due to reversal of a fine in the prior year results and unfavorable currency impacts. In our Merchant segment joint ventures, volumes overall were about flat with a strength from lin injection (ph) in Mexico offset by weakness in other countries. Lower interest expense due mainly to lower rates and fewer shares outstanding, each contributed $0.03. Now, I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires: Thanks Paul. Please turn to Slide five, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of $870 million, down 14% versus prior year. Currency reduced sales by 12%. Underlying sales only declined 2% with volumes down 8% and pricing adding 6%. Sequentially, Merchant Gases of sales decreased 6%. Volumes were down 5% versus Q1. Pricing was up 1%, and currency reduced sales by 2%. Volume declines versus prior year and prior quarter, reflected downturn in global manufacturing, a carry over of shutdowns from December and the Lunar New Year impact in Asia. Volumes were weakest in January with some improvement in both February and March. System loadings for the quarter were in the low 70s. Despite this drop in loadings, pricing was flat sequentially and up versus prior year. Merchant Gases operating income of $156 million was down 17% versus prior year. Segment operating margin of 17.9% was down versus prior year and sequentially, due to lower volumes and reduced system loading. Margins benefited from improved cost performance. Let me provide now a few comments by region. Please turn to Slide six. In North America, sales fell 10% versus prior year driven by a very slow manufacturing climate. Volumes were down 15% versus prior year and price added 5%. Volumes were especially impacted by lower argon, Liquid Hydrogen and distributor sales. New business signings were slightly ahead of Q1, but below prior year. In Europe, sales decreased 18% versus prior year mainly due to currency. Underlying sales only declined 1% with volumes down 7% and pricing adding 6%. Similar to North America, we saw weak demand across most end-markets and regions in Europe. Pricing remained solid in the quarter in both our liquid bulk and package gas businesses. Signings in Europe were below Q1 levels but remained ahead of plan. In Asia, Merchant sales were down 17% versus last year with currency reducing sales by 10%. Underlying sales declined 7% with volumes down 12% and prices up 5%. Volumes were impacted by significantly lower demand from electronics customers as well as the overall manufacturing slowdown in Asia. Signings were lower than in Q1. Please turn to slide seven, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $625 million decreased 28% compared to last year. Natural gas and raw material pass through decreased sales by 15%. Currency reduced sales by an additional 6% and volumes were up 7%. Aggregate volumes were up 6% versus prior year. Increased refinery hydrogen demand was partially offset by declines in sales to steel and chemical customers. Sequentially, sales were down 16%, mainly due to lower natural gas and raw material pass through, which reduced sales by 14%. Operating income of $98 million was down 12% compared to last year and 10% versus last quarter. The year-on-year and sequential declines were due to lower steel and chemical customer operating rates and the stronger dollar. Operating margin of 15.7% increased versus last year and sequentially due to lower natural gas and raw material pass through. We announced our hydrogen contract with Marathon Detroit last night and our key projects are proceeding inline with expectations. Please turn to slide eight; Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $332 million were down 41% compared to last year. Volumes reduced sales by 38% and currency reduced sales by 3%. Electronics sales were down 47% compared to last year and 21% sequentially worst than forecast. This reflected the dramatic global downturn in semiconductor and flat panel capacity utilization that continued to decline this quarter. Specialty materials sales were down 50%. Equipment sales were down 74% versus prior year. While costs in this business were significantly reduced, the collapse in electronics materials' demand was responsible for the overall segment losses in the quarter. In Performance Materials, volumes declined 31% versus last year and 12% sequentially, reflecting weakened demand in our end-markets. Asia continued to be the weakest region followed by Europe and North America. Despite this significant drop in volumes, Performance Materials was profitable this quarter and is forecasting steady improvement going forward. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon process to be down about 35% in our fiscal 2009 versus our January prediction of about 20%. TFT LCD production is expected to be down about 20% during the same period. And finally, industry CapEx is now expected to be down approximately 50% versus prior year. While we believe the worst is behind us, we now anticipate a slower recovery in our Electronics business than we did last quarter based upon customers' projections. That being said, we are encouraged by the growing number of affordable take opportunities that we have signed over the last few quarters. Please turn the Slide nine; Equipment and Energy. Sales of $128 million increased 22% compared to last year, due to increased large air separation unit activity. Operating income of $16 million increased due to improved cost performance. We did add one LNG heat exchanger order to our backlog this quarter. Our backlog in this segment now totals $281 million. We are in the final stages of commissioning the first APX exchanger in the support of Carter gas 2 (ph) and we expect to see a new order for an LNG heat exchanger this year. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck: Thanks Nelson. Now if you will please turn to Slide 10. I'd like to share our outlook for the second half of fiscal 2009. We saw a significant deterioration in the economy during the first half of fiscal 2009. And our outlook for the second half of the year is now for a slower recovery than we have previously anticipated. We expect the global manufacturing contraction to persist through the end of our fiscal year in September. However, we are hopeful we have reached the bottom and that we'll see modest sequential gains in both the U.S. and Asia excluding Japan, in our second half. Specifically for our businesses, we are forecasting slightly higher sequential volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials and in Merchant Gases. We expect that steel and chemical portions of the Tonnage Gasses segment will remain weak with the refinery hydrogen volumes remaining at current levels. On the cost side, we should see additional benefits from our cost reduction actions. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $0.93 to $1.02. As we look at the balance of 2009, we continue to be faced with an uncertain economic environment. Here is our current view on the global economy and our key markets for fiscal 2009. Overall, we now expect manufacturing to decline globally by 9% to 10%, much greater than the 4% to 5% we spoke to you about last quarter. Regionally, we are forecasting declines of 10% in the U.S., 11% in Europe and about 3% in Japan, excluding...it's about 3% in Asia excluding Japan. Specifically, by market, we expect the following: Refinery hydrogen demand should hold up well even with the drop in demand for transportation fuels as the refineries that use large quantities of hydrogen had the best cash margins and will continue to operate. In Electronics, we do expect that market recovery will be slower than previously anticipated, but fiscal quarter two should be the bottom for our volumes. As Nelson mentioned earlier, we forecast millions of square inches processed to decline about 35% in fiscal 2009. We expect that chemical markets will decline more than 20% in 2009, until key markets such autos, housing and consumer goods, start to pick up. Overall, global steel operating rates remain depressed at about 50%. We don't expect this to improve until late in calendar 2009. We still expect the second quarter to be our low point with the cost reduction actions we are taking, some seasonal improvement in demand and new project start ups, our second half earnings should improve. We are now forecasting our fiscal 2009 earnings from continuing operations excluding charges related to cost reduction to be between $3.85 and $4.05 per share. With regard to capital spending, we still expect that it'll be about equal the fiscal 2008 spending of 1.4 billion. While business inquiry activity is still active, awards for new projects have been slow as would be expected in this uncertain economic climate. It is still too early for us to give you a capital spending number for 2010 as it will depend upon the level of business that does get awarded over the rest of calendar 2009. Turning to Electronics. We are disappointed by our current business performance. We have made significant changes in the business over the past two years. However, the recent downturn and our performance say, we need to do more. We are currently concluding a study of this entire business with the outcome intended to return Electronics to earning above its cost of capital. Given our more negative economic outlook and our belief that the recovery will be slower, we are considering additional cost reduction actions in the company that could result in a charge in our fiscal third quarter. I will provide more details for you next quarter after we finalize our plans. As we look beyond the current economic turmoil, we remain convinced that there are still solid fundamentals for driving industrial gas demand growth in the future. Remember, that our products are used to save and efficiently use energy, to improve processes and environmental performance, to efficiently de-bottleneck processes to quickly and cheaply add capacity, and finally, to improve the quality of our customers' products. Simply stated, industrial gases help our customers lower their cost and become more productive while producing better products and protecting the environment. These continued opportunities to grow when coupled with our solid business model based on long-term contracts, provide us with a strong set of fundamentals that will help us continue to deliver value to our shareholders. In closing, we remain committed to the necessary actions to improve our margins in return. The cost actions we are taking are not only to preserve our near-term profit but more importantly, they also position us with the right cost structure for achieving our 70% margin goal as volumes recover. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Jenny to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Hi, good morning.
Paul Huck: Hi Jeff.
Nelson Squires: Good morning Jeff.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: I've got a couple of questions. The first is that your interest expense in the second quarter was 30 million, in the first it was 36.5. I know your rates are down, so is 30 a good number to use going forward? And secondly, you talked about Equipment and Energy having good cost cutting and on a sequential basis that also was an improvement where you went from seven million to 16.3. So basically, my question is, is the 16.3 quarterly number sustainable and is the 30 million quarterly number sustainable?
Paul Huck: Okay. On the interest Jeff, I think the...on the $30 million going forward, I think that's a god number. Regarding Equipment and Energy, I would not sustain that as the forecast some of that also comes through the profit coming through the projects here and workload continues to decline in those areas.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then lastly, across your businesses, which are the areas where you feel that there is the most risk of price going down?
Nelson Squires: Well, certainly there is most risk which we have demonstrated consistently is Electronics. And that's the area in which I feel the most risk.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Is there a lot there or a little or sort of how do you see pricing in Electronics over the next several quarters?
Paul Huck: I think with the volumes coming down, there has been, as we've seen a price pressure, across Electronics and Performance Materials, Performance Materials prices have gone up, so we are roughly about have maintained ourselves about flat in that. I would not think that price at this point in time Jeff, for us as we look at that is a huge down factor for us. I think we...the thing which we have seen, which has driven our earnings down has been really two basic factors, one has been the currency declines, the strength of the U.S. dollar and the second has been the contraction in volumes. And those are probably the risks for us.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you very much.
Nelson Squires: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Yes, good morning Paul.
Paul Huck: Morning, P.J.
Nelson Squires: Hi, P.J.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Yeah hi, Nelson. Can you give us some understanding on the project pipeline as you mentioned refinery steel chemical projects are getting delayed. Can you quantify the pipeline for us, how many projects do you have, how many are getting delayed?
Nelson Squires: Well yes, and we actually don't...I don't count the number of projects because as we've said before it always, you can count a $5 million project, you can have a $200 million project and they count the same in that. As we have looked at this, I think and we looked at 2010, as far as the things which we have said and the boost in earnings from 2010 of new projects, I think that is and that's good for us. I think we are going to see somewhere in the $0.30 to $0.40 a share boost in earnings from the projects coming on stream. The next factor for us then comes out as to what's coming on stream in 2011, 2012? We do have some projects which we're currently booking and that's...and it would not be right now as big a boost in 2011 from those projects. Roughly stated, it's probably may be half to two thirds of that at this point in time as I look at it. But we still have time to take orders so that is somewhat of a normal view of it. I am really talking mainly about our on site projects here P.J.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Okay. So near-term you feel you are okay, but long-term some projects could slip?
Nelson Squires: Well certainly as we have said, I mean we are in... and you can see the capacity factors which were out there, which people are running at. And so, it's not a good environment now for people to expand capacity. And so, a lot of the new projects go around capacity expansion. All that said, we announced a project last night on Marathon for Detroit for their Detroit refinery. So we are still seeing some activity. Its not...it is not like we... it is not like we have no activity. We are still seeing activity occur around the refinery hydrogen segment and we are also seeing activity principally in China as we mentioned before I think to you.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Okay. And quickly on Merchant Gases, Paul can you tell us what your average operating rates are in U.S., Europe and Asia?
Paul Huck: The average operating rates was in the low 70s across the regions.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: If that's the case, then what do you think will happen to pricing sequentially? Can you really hold prices at 70% operating rates?
Paul Huck: Well for us and I can only speak for our products here. As far as the philosophy on pricing as we look at this, is that...it does not pay for us to go out and cut prices to load a plan for when I'm going to give a price for five years. My operating rates are going to start to tick up. I think we've hit the low end of things here. We haven't seen a tremendous amount of customers go away from us. We've seen their takes decline. And so, as we look at this, it is something which for the future, you don't want to cut prices because you're going to live with the price for five years and it doesn't make sense that you're going to take something at a low margin to cure what could be a six to 12-month problem, let's say.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: That's good thinking. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Good morning, Paul and Nelson.
Paul Huck: Hi Dave.
Nelson Squires: Hey Dave.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Hey Paul, on the Electronics study, who is conducting it? Is it again some help from the outside and could it result in the sale or divestiture of portions or even larger portion of that business?
Paul Huck: As far as the study and we are using the people internally who we have to lead the study, we are also making... we are also consulting outside resources obviously on that and taking a look at given the sharp downturn in the industry, what is the outlook, what are the changes that are going to come in the industry and from the sharp downturn. What's sort of shake outs to that, what sort of changes in customer base et cetera, so we're taking a long hard look at that. And Dave as far as any sale piece of business or things like that, I think the thing which we have always said about on the Air Products businesses, there aren't any secret costs here and so, if something is not right for us to hold it, we're not going to hold it.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: How long will that study take to complete?
Paul Huck: I would expect that we will be talking to you about the results of that study at the end of quarter three.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And last question, your SG&A fell 26% in the quarter year-over-year, is that type of decline sustainable in the back half of the year?
Paul Huck: The factor is that I expect my SG&A to be about the same or a little bit lower coming forward here, going forward. One factor on the SG&A is currency. Its hurt earnings, but it's helped SG&A also. But the cost reduction has been a big factor in there.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov with Barclays Capital.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Hi, good morning.
Paul Huck: Hi Sergey.
Nelson Squires: Good morning, Sergey.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Paul, in the past, you had a chance to buyout some of your joint ventures partners in Asia and I realized it's the timing like this is safe to a given family or given circumstances. Again, given the continuing global recession, in some case credit crisis, is there more likelihood now that you will be successful in some of the steps this year?
Paul Huck: On the part of our JV partners and that always depends upon the partner and their desire to go out and sell. I can't make a comment on that for them. You'd have to ask them with that. We are very happy in our partnerships with them. They are fruitful. We believe they help us going forward. All that said, when it comes time for the partner if they want to exit, we are there and willing to buy it. We have the capital and the ability to execute those transactions.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Okay. And interestingly there some news stories about the current administration being classifying CO2 as potent (ph) and therefore, may be incrementally brings forwards the time when CO2 sequestration will become commercially visible, scalable option. What's your view? Has that news changed your time on the CO2, that profession?
Paul Huck: Sure. As far as us trying to take a view on CO2, we think it is a business opportunity for us and sequestering CO2, capturing it from power plants also making other fuels which could use industrial gases in the production of those fuels is possible for us. Just to give you a time line, the first thing which you need is a cap and trade system to pass or some sort of thing to get through Congress. So, if that happens 2009, 2010, it's probably going to take year or two to write the rigs then around it and then after the rigs are out, then people will start taking action. So, as we've already said, we think that the market for projects on this would start somewhere may be for us around 2012 or so, which we have things on stream 2014, 2015.
Nelson Squires: Yeah and Sergey this is Nelson, just adding one more comment. Just in the past 30 days or so, we announced an effort with a vat in fall (ph) in Germany which is really a first large scale demonstration of clean coal. And they were excited about that is as the not only to supplier of oxygen but also the supplier of proprietary technology. And we also believe this is a critical step in getting things moving forward. So, I wanted to point that out as an opportunity for us.
Paul Huck: And that's a good add Nelson. That is a good add there.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital: Thank you, both.
Paul Huck: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Hi, good morning.
Nelson Squires: Hi, Mike.
Paul Huck: Hi Mike.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: In terms of the equity affiliate income this quarter, quite a bit stronger than last quarter and you mentioned something in your remarks about the reversal of a fine in the prior year. Can you quantify what that fine was and maybe give us a little bit of guidance for what we might expect for that equity affiliates income number for next quarter?
Paul Huck: The fine in the prior year revolved around the reversal of the fine of a reserve which we talked for our accounting affiliate, when we got an unfavorable...when all the industrial gas companies in Italy got fined for on anti-trust. Those things were appealed, the Court reversed the decision of the Italian Government and we didn't have to pay it. And so that happened in quarter two of '08 for us. That was worth about $0.02 of share to us, Mike. If we take a look going forward on equity affiliates we think equity affiliates will be about flat going down. We're also taking cost out in those areas. We are bringing some new projects on but overall, and there we are also seeing demand being cut as everyone is in business.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: So, $0.02 a share so roughly (Technical Difficulty).
Operator: One moment, sir.
Paul Huck: Yeah.
Operator: Your line is open Mr. Harrison.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: I'll move on and maybe follow.
Paul Huck: Yeah Mike, and $0.02 a share is about $6 million source.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Okay, on the Merchant side, clearly the pricing's holding up on your existing contracts but I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing trends for new customers, new installations. Are you seeing more competitive bids that are impacting the profitability of new business or are you still pretty happy with the margins on new business?
Paul Huck: Nelson, why don't you comment?
Nelson Squires: Yeah Mike, this is Nelson. Yeah, we really have not seen a significant change in bidding activity. Obviously, there are fewer opportunities right now but we are still seeing a fairer number of opportunities tied to new uses of industrial gases. And around environment around Energy, reducing reliance on carbon-based fuels et cetera, and in those types of deals we are able to bring applications technology to the point of sale and that is certainly helping us with the pricing. So, it really hasn't been any significant change in behaviors in the last six to nine months.
Operator: And moving on, we have a question from Mike Judd with Greenwich Consultant.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Yes Good morning. You guys benefited in the quarter from lower natural gas prices and your Tonnage Gases business, something that natural gas prices could go as low as $2.50. Could you just, I realized your volume issues and currency issues but maybe talk about that particular aspect going forward into the remaining part of your fiscal year, what kind of impact that could have on the margins?
Paul Huck: Yeah Mike, if you take a look at the natural gas prices, I think as we've commented before, is that they really...they helped the margin and they don't really do anything for profits for us. So, it's a sales impact because it's the past in that business. First, on your comment of 2.50, I don't think that's our forecast either going forward and so, but if they did go down, we would see a slight increase in our margins but once again, we are running this business for returns and not for margins on here. It's wide cap on the ground and if we constraint our margins, if gas is at ten or gas is at three, its how much cash we're taking out of the business versus how much capital.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies: Good morning. First on the Tonnage business, could you discuss what are you seeing any significant project cancellations or delays and if that's playing in too so that you were looking at the 2011 timeframe?
Paul Huck: Hi Laurence. As far as delays and yes we have, I think a comment which we made last quarter is we continue to see the oil sands push out in time for us. I mean that is not surprising given the price of oil and what sort of things are happening there. And as far as other projects, steel has been obviously slow in there, so we are seeing things push out in time. As far as the projects which we have in-house, which we are bringing on stream in 2009-2010, we believe they're solid and they are in construction, they are in the field and that they are going to come on stream.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies: And then if you look at the Merchant business where the contracts that are coming up for renewal, roughly how much do you think pricing for those contracts is below the average of the portfolio right now? And that is they were negotiated five years ago. Pricing has moved since then. How much do you have a chance as to mark up just to catch up to the marketplace?
Paul Huck: Laurence and the prices for a lot of these contracts have been taken up overtime for us. So as we have implemented price increases we've also gone into certain customers and changed that around. As I said before, as far as their product is concerned on pricing, we are... and we look at this as we make a dedication of a portion of our capacity for a long-term period of time. We are going to price it to get the return which we need to do to invest in this business.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Banc of America.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America: Yes, good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning, Kevin.
Nelson Squires: Good morning, Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America: If you go through the Tonnage business, just wondering if you could comment on how many customers, let's say in steel and in chemicals may be operating below they take or pay minimum requirements and to the extent that may have occurred what impact that has on your margins and segments?
Paul Huck: We certainly have a lot, a lot of our customers operating below the mid right now with steel operating rates at 50%. And so that and that does have an impact in some as this is for us. And, I think what you have to remember is in a lot of these projects, I don't even pay the power though. And so, it doesn't go through sales for me. And so, a lot of this is the capital cover and the operating and maintenance cost which I still have because I still maintain my plant ready to go.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America: Okay. So if I look at your margins in the segment and try to back out the very large effect from natural gas, it looks like Tonnage margins still would've been up, perhaps 50 basis points or so on an underlying basis?
Paul Huck: We also like good costs.
Nelson Squires: We also have very good costs there.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America: And so I guess
Paul Huck: A comment here of course, the company, as I said before, is we've had good...we had good cost across in all of our segments.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America: Okay.
Paul Huck: Cost performance is good.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America: Okay. Fair enough. I'll leave it at that. And then second on cash flow, I appreciate you providing the full cash flow statement. Just had a question relative to payables and accrued liabilities which look like it increased roughly $215 million versus the prior quarter, just wondering if you could elaborate on what might be driving that?
Paul Huck: Yeah, the payables and the accrued liabilities actually went down. And so, they were actually a use of cash there by us paying it down. The two big factors in there are pension and tax payments, which we made. And there is a timing aspect to those things. If I were just to look, and just take this opportunity on free cash flow and we were ...and free cash flow was down roughly about a 160, it was negative about $160 million in the first half of the year. As we go forward and look at that because of those timing aspect, we think that there is about $300 million reversal of that as we go forward here. Capital spending is probably going to pick up as it normally does during the summer for us a little bit. But we're going probably be slightly free cash flow positive for the year overall.
Operator: And moving on, we have Don Carson with UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, thank you. A couple of questions, one...Nelson on Merchant Gas as you mentioned U.S. that you are seeing lower liquid argon and liquid helium sales. Is the lower liquid argon, is that a supply constraint because your steel customers are running so low you are having trouble getting liquid argon or is it reflect weak demand as well?
Paul Huck: It's weak demand. That was an issue probably through our first quarter. But demand has deteriorated enough that it's actually there is enough supply out there. And the other comment was lower on liquid hydrogen sales, helium is holding up fine. There is...there is just sales to the government are down substantially and liquid helium in the quarter. Liquid hydrogen, I'm sorry. Again liquid helium we are doing find there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Sison with KeyBanc.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc: Hey guys.
Paul Huck: Hi Mike.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc: In terms of electronics you have lead out this three different areas in that business; gases, Tonnage, special materials were they all lets say in the red for the quarter or maybe as it's Tonnage at least on the profitable side?
Paul Huck: Tonnage business is making money on that.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc: Okay.
Paul Huck: The issue for us in Electronics, as we've said before, is Specialty Materials and the related equipment business. The related equipment business is obviously is not going to have good sales in it given the state of capital spending. But that's really a business which enables on the spend specially gases and materials then.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc: Okay. And given the sequential improvement you're looking for in the third and fourth quarter for Electronics, do we get back in the black at that point?
Paul Huck: We will expect that the, in the third quarter that we're still going to loose money. But that we turn to profitability in the fourth quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thanks very much. Paul, I might have missed it but I wondered if gas in North America Merchant was off 10 in Asia up 7, that Europe was been only down 1%. Can you just remind me again why that was stronger and what the near-term outlook there would be?
Nelson Squires: Hi Bob, this is Nelson. That's really attributable to good results in the European homecare business. And so, that's really what drove the difference. In terms of industrial demand they were roughly similar with probably European a little worse.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Got it. And then, I guess I'm still trying to reconcile your more somber semiconductor expectations versus some of the data out of this i.e. another industry trade groups. I think barely the numbers they showed actually do the first quarter volumes were up. You know why it wouldn't jive with your units down 35% for the year?
Paul Huck: We have not seen an uptick on that Bob, on that data to be honest with you. And a lot of our stuff comes from our large customers as we've dealt with them. And our large customers as far as the forecast which they have for those who are actually going out and trying to make forecasts are pretty somber themselves.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Do you think maybe there is, can you gauge if there's been a dramatic inventory reduction so that there will be a restock on top of whatever demand growth or do you think?
Paul Huck: Yes Bob, yeah I think we can and there has been a drop in inventories and we've seen that. I mean, I think everybody's being quite cautious right now. I think this is a... but something which, which at least our view right now happens in Q4 and not in Q3 given the forecast.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes form John Roberts with Buckingham Research.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: Morning guys.
Nelson Squires: How are you doing?
Paul Huck: Morning John.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: How do the captive gas operations behave in this environment? I assume refineries produce as much hydrogen as they were all processing, but how about the captive oxygen units at emerging markets, steel guys and chemical guys? Do they shutdown and for whatever minimum they need they take it from the merchant market or are they protecting their own operations and continuing to operate and maybe hurting the merchant mark a little that way?
Paul Huck: If a person operates in their own plant, what you will typically see is that they will take from their own plant themselves before they would business it from an industrial gas company.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: So they probably higher operating rates on average than the independent producers like yourself.
Paul Huck: Well all the captive guys, I mean they and those guys are really not out there producing any and not going out and selling against us. They are making it for their own usage.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: That's right that they protect their own volume for first.
Paul Huck: Sure I mean, but that only makes sense. Now that doesn't happen in a lot places. Okay, there is some obviously, there is some business where we go in and top off a customer who has captive plans but it's not a big factor in our volumes.
John Roberts - Buckingham Research: Thank you.
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: And moving on, we have a question from Steve Schumann (ph) with Lafayette Research.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning guys.
Nelson Squires: Hi Steve.
Paul Huck: Good morning, Steve.
Unidentified Analyst: Because gas is really our inventory, can you talk about any uptick in demand in any of your businesses may be late in the quarter? Where we are struggling right now what's the underlying end demand versus an inventory re-stocking at the customer's side? Could you talk to that?
Paul Huck: If we look at the operating rates, one of the things which we have seen, is we did see operating rates of in a number of areas start to pick up from January and February in to March. It wasn't large. It was not huge, as far as things are concerned. And it was expected by us. And so, have steel operating rates picked up a little bit? Yes they have. On the chemical side, yes, they have. Across Asia to be honest, the economic activity was down far in January and in the beginning of February it started to pick up a little bit in February and March. And also we have seen some, we have seen some things there. But those are inline with the expectations. What we have not seen here is any anything which is solid from an economic standpoint which would say heavy economies overall are starting to move back. There is a lot of volatility out there and the consumer is still very concerned. And until those things start to get solved, I don't think we're going to see a lot of good momentum build in the economy.
Unidentified Analyst: So would you say there is upticks are really just a seasonal affect as opposed to potential higher end demand?
Paul Huck: Yes and the other thing is that I think what...the other factor which we have to consider that is that on the inventories. I mean people have been dragging down inventories. Inventories are low, and they have been dragged down a lot. I don't think they have a lot more to go right now. And so, people are taking up production to meet demand.
Unidentified Analyst: So basically while they can inventory gas they de-stock their end products...
Paul Huck: Yes and that's right. It's the end product, right. For us it's the end product which we look at and not the inventory gas.
Unidentified Analyst: And then real quick, the dollars been a bit strong here, I guess you guys have an outlook going forward?
Paul Huck: We don't gamble along those lines. No, we don't. I mean as far as which way, and we try to operate and set up our cash flows so that we have, so we don't have a lot exposure. We try to match everything as much as possible because we think that that's a hard thing for us to do to go out and predict the currency.
Unidentified Analyst: Could you remind me what your number of your contracts, your longer term contracts are independent of foreign exchange due to contractual terms?
Paul Huck: The bulk of our contracts don't have any real exposure here because I match my revenues and my costs up. And so I don't have any...I've not matched. I'm not an exporter of a huge amount of stuff where I don't sell in dollars. As an example a lot of my electronic sales even into Asia go in dollars because of the production of some of those products here in the U.S., so I try to keep myself well matched in that area.
Unidentified Analyst: Alright, thank you.
Paul Huck: You're welcome.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Mark Gulley with Soleil Securities.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Hey, good morning guys.
Paul Huck: Hey Mark.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Got a question for you on margins. It looks like operating margins may have troughed here at 13.3 if I'm doing my math right, here in the March quarter. If I remember your remarks Paul you talked about 17 being the goal. Can you give us an idea of how long you think it's going to take to meet that 17 goal given where you are now?
Paul Huck: Yeah Mark, if I were to take a look at our operating margins, and just walk you forward from there. As we look at the cost reductions, we think our cost reductions overall probably, overtime, are going to raise the operating margins from the things in which we put in motion right now, about a point and a half or so. We think the volume from our new projects probably also contributes about half of percent. And then the remaining comes from the recovery of volume in the economy here. And as that happens and so is that 2010, I don't think so. It could be 2011, if we start to get some good momentum in the economy towards the end of 2009.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Hey, that's pretty helpful. Can you give us an idea of what the volume, negative volume variance has hit your margins by thus far, to you can give us some idea, for example, how far do actually have to go to see when your volumes...
Paul Huck: On the volume impact and roughly the volume impact is probably about, today about 2% or so.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: And a housekeeping question. Note for you talk a little bit about the bankrupt customer. Have you already reserved for that, or is that a reserve that's still coming?
Paul Huck: No, we had not taken. We have not taken any reserve on that customer.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Is there a reason why you haven't yet?
Paul Huck: Because we...as we look at we still think there is a good chance to us being able to go out and recover that.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Thanks Paul.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And moving on, we have a question from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer: Hi, good morning.
Paul Huck: Hi Ed.
Nelson Squires: Hi Ed.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer: In Electronics, how much further can you get margins up if revenues stay flat? How many more, how much more cost can you take out of that business?
Paul Huck: As far as that is concerned, we can cut some cost but this whole thing is going to have to involve complete look at the business. Our goal still get this thing back to a 15% plus margin for us and we are not going to get and we can't get there with just going out and cutting cost is our view, we got do other things that could include pricing, it include other actions.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer: So Paul when you talk about the potential for third quarter charge related to additional cost cutting, which businesses would that cost cutting focus on?
Paul Huck: We are looking across the whole company and trying to make our plans there. And so we are in the process of doing that right now and so it's too early for me to single anything out. But we're going to look across the company and say, how do we size the business for the opportunity going forward here.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer: And when you think about your European exposure, what percentage of that is Central Europe and Poland right now? And of the 7% volume decline you had this quarter, can you segment that by Western Europe and Central Europe please?
Paul Huck: If we look at on the European business, we are roughly Central and Eastern Europe is roughly about maybe 15% of that total for us. As far as on the volumes declines, I don't do that across there but I will tell you that volumes did decline in those countries. We actually managed across product lines there. But the volumes and they did decline there, so I would not say it was extremely and better or worse there.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer: Thank you very much.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Squires, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Nelson Squires: Thanks Jenny. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00 PM today. Thanks for joining us and have a nice day.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation.

Operator:  Good morning and welcome to Air Products and Chemicals first quarter 2009 earnings results conference call. (Operator Instructions)  Beginning today’s call is Mr. Nelson Squires, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Squires, you may begin.
Nelson Squires:  Thank you Elizabeth. Good morning and welcome to Air Products quarterly earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today CFO Paul Huck and I will review our fiscal 2009 first quarter results and outlook. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 PM Eastern Time are also available on the website.  Please turn to Slide 2. As always, today’s teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the safe harbor language on this slide and at the end of today’s earnings release. Before we start, please note that today’s comments on operating results will exclude the $174 million restructuring charge. Details are included in the notes to the earnings release. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck:  Thank you Nelson. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Now please turn to Slide Number 3. As we indicated back on December 16, declining conditions in the business around the world are creating one of the weakest business environments that we have seen across our end markets in some time. This quarter buyings declined each month as many customers are running at significantly lower operating rates or in some cases, have temporarily idled their facilities completely. Sales of $2.2 billion declined 5% versus prior year, excluding currency and natural gas pass-through impacts. Underlying business was off primarily due to lower volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials segment.  Demands were lower in Merchant Gases but this decline was offset by higher pricing. Sequentially, the rapidly deteriorating business conditions are more obvious. Underlying business was off 8% sequentially on lower volumes across Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases, and Tonnage Gases. Nelson will walk you through the details by segment momentarily. Consolidated operating income declined by 24%, driven by the lower volumes and unfavorable currency. Our operating margin declined 270 basis points versus last year, primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher prices and lower costs. For the quarter versus prior year, our net income and diluted earnings per share decreased by 21% and 18% respectively. Return on capital employed was unchanged versus prior year.  Now let me turn to Slide 4 and review the factors that affected the quarters’ performance in terms of earnings per share. There were two disclosed items this quarter. In discontinued operations we took an additional impairment charge this quarter, reflecting a revision of the estimated net realizable value of the U.S. Healthcare business. Discussions with potential buyers for this business continue. As we finalize our restructuring charge, the actual cost per business exits and asset management actions and the number of positions impacted were slightly higher than our initial estimates back in December. Excluding the discontinued operations and the restructuring charge, our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.21 versus last year. Lower volumes accounted for $0.25 of the year-on-year decline. Pricing and margins together, including energy and raw materials, were favorable netting to $0.05. Our cost improvement actions contributed $0.03. Unfavorable currency and foreign exchange cost us $0.13. Lower interest rates added $0.01. A lower tax rate added $0.03. And fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.05. Now I’ll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson.
Nelson Squires:  Thanks Paul. Please turn to Slide 5, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases posted sales of  $925 million, down 8% versus prior year. Currency reduced sales by 8%, while volumes were down 6% and pricing added 6%. We delivered solid pricing performance worldwide, and this helped to offset the volume declines. Sequentially, Merchant Gases sales decreased 16%. Volumes were down 7% and currency reduced sales by 9%. Merchant Gases operating income of $171 million was down 15% versus prior year. Segment operating margin of 18.4% was down 150 basis points versus prior year due to lower volumes and reduced system loading. Operating margins were up 50 basis points sequentially due to improved cost performance. Let me now provide a few comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6. In North America, sales increased 2% versus prior year, driven by strong pricing gains. Our one October price increase was well timed. Volumes were down 6% versus prior year, reflecting weakness across most of our end markets and the impact of a very soft December. New business signings were stronger than Q4 but below prior year. In Europe, sales decreased 13% versus prior year. Currency reduced sales by 12%, while price added 6% and volumes were down 7%. Similar to North America, we saw demand weaken across most end markets and regions in Europe. The availability of argon was impacted by steel shutdowns across both the U.S. and Europe. Pricing was strong in the quarter in both our liquid bulk and packaged gas businesses. Signings in Europe were ahead of planned and well ahead of prior year. In Asia, Merchant sales were down 8% versus last year. Currency reduced sales by 7%, while volumes were down 6% and prices were up 5%.  Volume declines were mostly due to lower demand from steel and worsening demand from electronics. Pricing was solid and signings were strong and on pace with the prior year. With regard to the overall Merchants segment performance in these difficult times, we are encouraged by strong pricing and very good new business signings, driven by our strong applications capability. Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $744 million decreased 6% compared to last year. Currency reduced sales by 4% and volumes, excluding hurricane impacts, were down 2%. The two Gulf Coast hurricanes reduced sales an additional 2%. Natural gas and raw material pass-through increased sales by 2%. Sequentially, sales were down 21% with natural gas and raw material pass-through reducing sales by 13% and lower volumes reducing sales 7%.  Sales in the quarter reflected continued strong refinery hydrogen demand, offset by reduced demand from steel and chemical customers. Operating income of $109 million was down 2% compared to last year, and 19% versus last quarter. The sequential decrease was due to lower steel and chemical customer operating rates, a stronger dollar, and seasonally higher maintenance costs. Operating margin of 14.6% increased 60 basis points versus last year due to cost efficiencies, and 30 basis points sequentially due to lower natural gas costs. Our project backlog remains strong and continues to be on schedule for this fiscal year and next. Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $407 million were down 21% compared to last year. Volumes reduced sales by 20%, pricing added 1% and currency reduced sales by 2%. Electronic sales were down 28% compared to last year, and reflect the significant global downturn in semiconductor and flat panel capacity utilization that worsened throughout this quarter. In Performance Materials, pricing was up 9%. Volumes declined 17% due to weaker demand in coatings, autos, and housing. Asia was the weakest region followed by Europe and North America. Many Asian customers have indicated that they will remain down through the Lunar New Year. New product sales in Performance Materials increased 15% versus prior year, and overall pricing remains solid. Operating income of $25 million was down 63% versus prior year. Operating margin of 6.1% was down 670 basis points versus prior year, driven by the steep decline in volumes across the segment. While overall semiconductor capital spending will be down substantially this year, we continue to win new thin film photovoltaic opportunities around the world. Please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $120 million in this segment increased 19% compared to last year due to higher large air separation plant sales. Operating income of  $7 million decreased due to lower L&G heat exchanger activity. Our backlog in this segment now totals $324 million. We are seeing some renewed activity in the L&G heat exchanger area and we expect two to three orders in 2009, as more resources are available to the L&G industry and capital costs have leveled off. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck:  Thank you Nelson. Now if you’ll turn to Slide 10. I’d like to share my thoughts on our 2009 outlook. As I stated earlier, the global economy got worse in the first quarter. We expect that the economy will continue to deteriorate in Quarter 2, and expect the second quarter to be the worst quarter of 2009.  January volumes have started slow, as many of our customers have extended their holiday shutdowns into this month. Additionally, we will see the impact of Lunar New Year in Asia this quarter. Specifically for our businesses, we are forecasting lower sequential volumes in Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and the steel and chemical portions of Tonnage Gases for Quarter 2. On the favorable side, we will see some impact from our cost reductions; a larger impact will be seen in Quarters 3 and 4. Our guidance for Q2 is for earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.90. As we look at 2009, we are facing the most uncertain economic environment we have seen in decades. Here is our current view on the global economy and our key markets for our fiscal 2009. Overall, we now expect manufacturing to decline globally by 4 to 5%, with the U.S. declining 6 to 7%; Europe declining 6 to 7%; and Asia, excluding Japan, growing about 2%. The global decline is down significantly from the 1 to 2% growth we gave you in our initial 2009 guidance. Specifically, by market, we expect the following. Refinery hydrogen demand should hold up well, even with the drop in demand for transportation fuels as the refineries that use large quantities of hydrogen have the best cash margins and will continue to operate. Electronics will continue to decline in Quarter 2. However, we do expect that sometime in our third or fourth quarters we will start to see a sequential increase. Overall, we forecast MSI to decline greater than 20% in fiscal 2009 and we are also forecasting a similar decline for LCD displays. PV volumes will grow, but they have a small impact right now. Chemical markets will continue to decline in 2009 until key end markets such as autos, housing and consumer goods start to pick up. Overall, we expect the chemical industry demand for our products to be down 10 to 15% in our fiscal 2009. Overall, global steel operating rates decreased significantly in the first quarter to about 50%. We don’t expect this to improve until late in calendar year 2009. Given this demand outlook, we expect the second quarter to be our low point. With the cost reduction actions we are taking, second half earnings should be better. We are now forecasting our fiscal 2009 earnings from continuing operations, excluding the charge, to be between $4.00 and $4.30 per share. We remain committed to improving our margins and returns. The cost actions we are taking are not only to attain our near term profits; they also position us with the right cost structure for achieving our 17% margin goal when volumes recover. As we look beyond 2009, we still see a solid set of fundamentals for driving industrial gas demand in the future. As the world seeks alternative forms of energy, and better efficiency in using its existing energy resources, and improvements in the environment, industrial gases will play a large role in the solutions people use. These opportunities include hydrogen for clean fuels; oxygen for gasification of solid fuels to reduce both power and petrol chemicals; oxygen for combustion efficiency; oxygen for capturing carbon emissions; and nitrogen for enhanced oil and gas recovery. These opportunities will drive our capital spending in 2009 and beyond. Currently we are forecasting capital expenditure for 2009 to be in line with 2008. In closing, while the current environment is challenging, our fundamentals remain solid. We have taken the right actions to adjust our cost structure to the size of the business, and will continue to do so in the future. Our operating cash flow is strong and protected by long term contracts. Our balance sheet and access to capital give us the ability to improve and grow our business as the markets change and opportunities present themselves. Thank you. And now I’ll turn the call over to Elizabeth to take your questions.
Operator:  Your first question comes from David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  Paul, any further insights to the backlog and any cancellations or delays that you’ve seen recently?
Paul E. Huck:  Yes, Dave, we have not seen any of our projects cancelled. We have seen our projects delayed. And you can see that in the reductions in capital spending. The other thing in which we’re seeing as far as the backlog is concerned is that on the order side, I think that we’re going to see delays in orders going out. People are not going to make a lot of long term decisions at this point in time with the economic uncertainty that’s out there.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank:  And just on electronics, obviously a very severe environment. Any structural erosion in electronics profitability and long term electronics operating margin targets?
Paul E. Huck:  No, Dave. As we take a look at the business long term, we continue to take the right actions and decide the business correctly. A lot of the reduction which you’re seeing here is around our electronics business. They’ve been the one which has been hardest hit on the volume side and so we’re taking the right actions to do that. The commitment on the margin target remains for us.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs:  Firstly, can you offer us any rays of hope out there that you’ve seen some improvement after some de-stocking period in your end markets? Has there been any improvement in trends? And then secondly, I think Paul if I do the math, based on what you’re saying about this current very weak quarter, it would imply a year-on-year improvement second half fiscal ’09 versus second half fiscal ’08. And just wondering how you get comfort around what might be some optimism things there that things are better than the prior year.
Paul E. Huck:  Bob, if we take a look at on the rays of hope for things, I don’t think I’m seeing it in the operating rates of my customer base. The good news, which I already gave you, was that in fiscal ’08 and fiscal ’09 so far the refining of hydrogen business has held up very well. And so that is a very good performance for us. So I think we’re happy with that as we take a look at that. And if we look at the economy as a whole, and you try to take and break the economy down, I hope that we have moved through the bulk of the financial crisis portion of this. And that’s because of this, and until we get through that we’re not going to see rays of hope from the consumer. The consumers have gone back and retrenched.  So if we take the first phase that occurs on the financial crisis side and the consumers have started that and they started that in the summer quarter and they went through the first quarter of our fiscal year and we think it’s going to get worse in the second quarter. Now the rays of hope which I would say is that we think things start to pick up on the consumer demand side in the third and fourth quarter for us. If I take a look at ’08 versus ’09, at my second half of guidance, I still think I’m down a little bit on that. I’m certainly not down as much as I was in the first half of the year, but it certainly is a much better year – a much better second half if you look at that. And the things which actually produce that, Bob, because if you take a look at that the thing which I’m going to – the cost reduction impact, that’s probably worth somewhere around $0.15 a share for me in the second half to first half. I have a number of new plants which come on strained. That’s probably worth about $0.10 a share, first half to second half on average. And then if I take a look at the volume recovery, how much is that worth? It’s probably worth somewhere around $0.30 to $0.40 first half to second half.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Steve Shuman] – Lafayette Research.
Steve Shuman – Lafayette Research:  Question on the currency impact from Merchant Gases. It was quite large. I was on the impression over the years you’ve been moving to setting your contracts up in dollars instead of the local currency. Can you kind of explain your efforts on that and where the currency impact came from?
Paul E. Huck:  Steve, we put our contracts in terms of where our costs are. And so in the Merchant Gas area, the bulk of our contracts are in the local currency because I produce in the local currency. So you know the sales are going to go down obviously, but my costs go down by the same amount or close to it, and the same percentage amount. 
Steve Shuman – Lafayette Research:  And then on electronics, you know, you’ve bought and sold a few companies through the years but how do you compare this downturn versus the one we saw in ’99 and 2000?
Paul E. Huck:  A lot faster into decline right now. We just got a preliminary look at the MSI for our first quarter of our fiscal year or the last quarter of ’08, and it is down about 35%. So it is a very sharp decline. It has not been a steady decline. And I think the reason why is that people are reacting to inventories; they don’t want to build inventories. And we’ll see how it plays out. In the forecast which we have, it has a continued decline in the second quarter but then a sequential pick-up in third and fourth quarter.
Steve Shuman – Lafayette Research: And then I guess on the profit side, you’ve done a lot of work cutting off various product lines that you felt weren’t important. How does that look versus the last time?
Paul E. Huck:  We have reacted a lot faster to that and we’re doing it right now, and we will continue to do that to get to the goals in the business in that margin. To get to the business goals for margin. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from [P.J. Juvekar] – Citi.
P. J. Juvekar – Citi:  In Merchant Gases you took a sizable hit of profitability. What is your average operating rate and do you think pricing can really hold if volumes keep dropping?
Nelson Squires:  P.J. this is Nelson. Let me answer that. Yes, certainly the biggest impact was operating rates. And if you – they’re really disadvantaged by a really weak December. We look across all three regions of the world, you know, everywhere operating rates dropped substantially in December. A lot of people just closed up in mid-December and frankly have taken their time getting started back up in January. So we saw operating rates drop in all three major regions that we operate in. But at the same time though you can see from our numbers that pricing has gone up in all three regions. We’re pretty happy about that. And we actually expect no change in that in the current time. The other thing that gives us some confidence here is you can see that signings remain pretty strong through the first quarter. We’re on level par with Asia. We’re up substantially in Europe and sequentially we saw an improvement in North America. So while operating rates are down, we think it’s more of a phenomenon of the very weak December and carrying into a pretty weak January. And we expect pricing to hold up.
P. J. Juvekar – Citi: And how much of your Merchant business, Nelson, would get re-priced this year? 
Nelson Squires:  That’s really a function of going out and doing price increases. And as we said in the commentary that we try to time our increases to more of a summer and early fall type of sequence. We are basically raising prices only in places now where we have cost changes, meaning cost increases. So that could be power. You know changes in de-regulation of power, etc. But we’re going to be very careful there and go for pricing only where it’s needed to get us recovery against cost increases.
P. J. Juvekar – Citi: One quick question for Paul. Paul, your operating cash flow was weak and less than your CapEx, so do you expect your debt to sort of go up throughout ’09 or do you expect any help from cash relief from working capital?
Paul E. Huck:  P. J., cash flow in the first quarter was held down by a few things. If you take a look at the operating cash flow, it’s about $170 million different from Q4 of ’08 – Q2, 1 of ’08. About a third of that P. J. is due to the drop in income and changes in depreciation. And so if I take a look at that, that’s what I would expect coming out of the business. We did have a couple of things which flowed through operating cash flow in this quarter. One was taking our derivative contracts and they get marked to a fair value, and we book a receivable which we’re going to receive during the year. That’s actually almost half of the difference in cash flow. And so I’m going to get that in through the year. The other thing was which on the year-on-year comparison is I got a refund in taxes last year, which was a one time item which boosted it and boosted it by about $30 to $40 million. So a long explanation but I think in terms of cash flow, I think we’re going to turn – it’s going to turn in 2009, Quarter 2, 3 and 4 it’s going to improve.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Peter Butler – Glen Hill Investments].
Peter Butler – Glen Hill Investments:  A year from now is a long time, but it’s usually one of the critical questions you ask yourself. You know, what is their products environment going to look like a year from now? And I’m wondering as you look down the road, is there going to be a new normal that we’re trying to get back to? Or are we going to get back to the old normal? Or do you think some of these changes are permanent and maybe you could talk a little bit about what you’re seeing next year.
Paul E. Huck:  Right now we are in a time of a lot of uncertainty as to where the economy is going. And hopefully as we go through 2009 and into 2010 we are going to see a lot of this – a lot of things come forward and we’ll have the economies picking up at that point in time. And that would be what you would normally expect as the world plays out and goes through a recessionary timeframe. And that’s important.  I think the other thing for us, which is important, is that we will be bringing on stream about $1 billion in capital in 2010 which is going to add a lot to our profitability in that time period. We have four contracts in the hydrogen area which come on stream, plus we have some oxygen plants which come on stream next year. And so that’s going to give us a good boost towards growth. The other thing is we’re going to see the impact of on the cost reductions, and we will do the right level of cost reductions to size the cost structure to the opportunity in the business.
Peter Butler – Glen Hill Investments: Second subject, the only time you mentioned share repurchases was during your mention of the pluses and minuses to earnings per share, and I think you said that fewer shares contributed $0.05 a share roughly. 
Paul E. Huck:  Yes.
Peter Butler – Glen Hill Investments:  I’m wondering what you actually did in share repurchases during the quarter. Did you take the opportunity to buy low after perhaps buying high previously? Or how is it working out?
Paul E. Huck:  I did not do any share buyback in the first quarter, Peter. If you take a look at the free cash flow it didn’t permit it. And one of the things which we said is that we were not going to get ahead of ourselves on this. We want to have the funds available because if we take a look at how we use cash, the first priority is always to invest it in good projects in the business and we still have a good number of projects in the business and they need to be funded and we’ll take that. I don’t expect I’m going to see an opportunity to buyback shares in the second quarter, and we’ll see in the last half of the year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mike Harrison - First Analysis.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis:  I was wondering if you could talk about what you’re seeing in terms of competitive behavior for new projects, any trends that might be of concern as they relate to the returns on future on-site projects.
Paul E. Huck:  Mike, for the moment we have not seen the prices going down or anything like that or our competitors in trying to grab projects. I think everyone still has a good backlog of things to bring on-stream. I think the thing which we have seen and I talked about this earlier is that we have seen bids postponed and projects delayed for the future. And so that’s kind of the environment which we are looking at, but for right now the pricing seems to be good for us.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis:  In your comments earlier on the equipment business, you said that you’re seeing some new activity that you thought might be related to capital costs leveling out. I was wondering if maybe you’re seeing that kind of perspective as well in customers looking at some new on-site projects that maybe we’ve hit an inflection point in terms of customers delaying decisions on their bigger projects?
Nelson Squires:  Mike, this is Nelson. Clearly activity in terms of discussion with customers and bidding on the L&G heat exchanger side is beginning to pick up again. And so we do expect some movement here this calendar year. With regard to your second question, I think people are still watching to see where the general economy is heading and where we – what bottom the economy finds, and therefore how much manufacturing capability is unloaded when we come out of the downturn.  That being said, there is still project activity in the places where you would expect; in hydrogen, in oxygen for gasification as Paul mentioned. And those activities have remained relatively steady here through the last six months, because most of those are long term decisions that A rated customers are making. And so that continues and we’ll see I think when we get out of this downturn the activity level across the project stack pick up again.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis:  The last question I had was on the electronics side. You mentioned that you expect sequential volume to increase in Q3 or Q4 but I was wondering what you’re hearing from customers in terms of when they expect to return to some level of “normalized production.” Any sense of when that happens and maybe where that production level might be relative to where it was before the downturn began? I mean, are we talking about production down 10% versus like an ’07 type of level, 15%, 5%?
Paul E. Huck:  Mike, if you would take a look at that and go out I think what we have said is that in the first quarter we saw a sharp drop on the MSI, which I talked about before. And we expect that to continue to drop and then a sequential pick-up in the third and fourth quarters. That would still leave the third and fourth quarters below the third and fourth quarters of 2008. So if you take a look on MSI, and it could be down anywhere from 20 to 30% for the year, what that would say is that the third and fourth quarters are likely to be somewhere 10 to 15% under the production rates in the third and fourth quarters of ’08.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: And then you said on the timing of returning to a more normalized is that what you mean by the sequential increase?
Paul E. Huck:  Yes, yes it is. And because it would be. If you take a look on MSI, the MSI in ’08 it was up in the first quarter, up in the second quarter, about flat in the third quarter on a sequential basis. It was down about 5% sequentially in the fourth quarter. And now it’s down 35% in the first quarter this year for us of ’09, and then we’re predicting a further downturn in the second quarter. So we are not going to get back up to the rates of ’08 until sometime in 2010 certainly.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.:  I guess first just in terms of functions, what’s your currency assumption embedded in your outlook?
Paul E. Huck:  Yes, if you look at the rates of the euro we probably have it about $1.30 right now.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.:  Would the plants that are being delayed is it broad based or are there particular industries that you’ve seen most of your delays?
Paul E. Huck:  Well, it is across the industries, Laurence. And so if you take chemicals, if you take the refining, if you take steel and stuff like that people are just not going out and making a lot of decisions long term right now on those industries, with the economic outlook.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.:  If you look at the new plants that are coming in over the next 18 months, if they just [ranted] their minimum take or pay contracts, what do you see as the year-over-year tailwind?
Paul E. Huck:  The increase year-over-year next 18 months we are probably looking at something around  $0.40 a share.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.:  Could you just give us a real quick snapshot on trends in the argon and helium markets?
Nelson Squires:  Clearly the supply of argon is being impinged by steel operating rates right now. We’ve seen that really happen most acutely in North America and Europe. Steel operating rates are probably under 50% right now in North America and Europe. We expect them to go down a little bit and probably not see recovery until late in 2009 in the calendar year. So I think argon will continue to be in shorter supply. Demand has obviously come down a little bit because of the slowdown in the economies, so we’re managing that situation right now. Pricing still remains very good in that product. Helium has the dynamics have not changed all that much. It’s still a pretty tight supply and demand remains relatively solid for the helium product. While we’ve seen MSI drop substantially, flat panel utilization has probably only dropped to about 80% and that is a new demand as you know for helium. So that market’s held up pretty well. So we expect things to remain tight throughout 2009.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: So in your data you said your prices year-over-year were up 3%. So last year your sales were  $2.2 billion, so if you multiply that by 3% you get $66 million and you know if you tax [affect] it that’s a benefit of about $0.23 a share. And in your slide you say that price/raw materials was a benefit of $0.05. So is the right way to read that number that the cost hit from raw materials was $0.18 roughly?
Paul E. Huck:  Yes.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan:  And could that be something where you might get some relief through the costs through the course of the year?
Paul E. Huck:  Yes, Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan:  Second thing is your shares outstanding on a sequential basis for fully diluted purposes went from 216.9 to 212.1 or down 4.8, but I think your basic shares went from 208.9 to 209.4 sequentially. I imagine that this has to do in part or in total with changes in the value of options because of the share price. So is this a permanent difference or a temporary difference or how do we account for that change in fully diluted share on a sequential basis?
Paul E. Huck:  The way in which you take a look at that is that the dilution increases from options as the price goes up. And so the decline in the prices of the shares takes options and takes the dilution impact down and that’s what happened.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan:  So if I understand that correctly then if your – if we look at where your share price was I guess over the past few months, it was sort of more like 70ish to pick a number. So if we were back up at $70 would your shares outstanding go back up to 216 or 217? How do we get back to that 217 number?
Paul E. Huck:  It would not go that high, Jeff, because if you look at it and you take a look at that 217 it was an average for the year last year I believe that you had. And so if you take a look at the fourth quarter it was actually lower. I don’t have the fourth quarter numbers right in front of me, but it was lower.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan:  In terms of the Merchant business, was hydrogen up and by what amount? And was oxygen and nitrogen and by what amounts to the quarter?
Nelson Squires:  Yes, you have to dissect that regionally. Hydrogen – basically all products were down. Nitrogen, oxygen actually up slightly in North America but really price driven versus volume driven. We saw - when you speak to hydrogen that’s liquid hydrogen demand was off for government contracts, which is a major customer, pretty substantial there. That really drives the hydrogen business; and on top of that, weaker demand. But if I look to Europe and Asia it was really demand in nitrogen and oxygen that was down that really pushed it. Helium was up for example and that was the biggest contributor in the decline.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan:  So in your slide it said hydrogen volumes up and oxygen and nitrogen volumes down. Can you give me those orders of magnitude? How much hydrogen was up and oxygen and nitrogen down?
Nelson Squires:  Well, hydrogen would have been up in the Tonnage segment. And that’s why I just want to make sure we’ve got apples and apples there. We were up in Tonnage year-on-year even with the hurricane impacts about 3%.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan:  So how much was oxygen and nitrogen down in Tonnage?
Paul E. Huck:  Tonnage it was down about 9% I believe Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan:  And then lastly in electronics, I guess I’d always thought that there might have been a more stable component to your electronics business. You know, maybe some onsite oxygen or onsite nitrogen. So maybe if you kind of break up electronics into Equipment and Specialty Gases and onsite oxygen and nitrogen, sort of how do those individual pieces look? How do they look in the quarter?
Paul E. Huck:  Jeff, before I just gave you – the [inaudible] number was down 6%. It wasn’t 9. If you take a look at the electronics volumes, and the volumes overall were down about 20% for us, and if you then take a look at the structure of what we had in the business, the Tonnage volumes which are about a third of the business were actually up 4%. Specialty materials, which is about half the business, was down about 20%. And then if you take the equipment and services portion of the business which is about 15% of the business, it was down 60% year-on-year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities:  You mentioned in your press release that one of your customers filed for bankruptcy and that you had $35.7 million of exposure there, presumably that the [Flying Bell Refinery] hydrogen. Can you address that in terms of your outlook? In other words is there any provision for higher bad debt expense reflected in your fiscal second quarter annual numbers?
Paul E. Huck:  We have not accrued anything for that bankruptcy which occurred in the beginning of January at this point in time, Kevin. We are seeing as far as the business overall, we are seeing bad debt expense go up though a little bit, but it’s not up a lot. We don’t have a lot of bad debt expense in our business.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities:  So these outlook numbers are really reflective of the underlying business, including any variables like that.
Paul E. Huck:  Yes. Yes they are.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities:  And then a broad question if I may on the Merchant business. You’ve indicated that you anticipate a global manufacturing decline of 4 to 5%. I was just wondering if you could comment on your expectations for volumes globally in the Merchant business. Historically we’ve seen the industry, I believe, grow at a premium due to application growth. In this market perhaps you have greater energy related headwinds such as net gas fracking in the light. So would you expect your volumes and merchants to be materially different than that global number for the fiscal year?
Nelson Squires:  Not materially different. We would see those volumes dip in Q2 I think as we bottom out as Paul referred to in terms of global demand. What also is going to weigh on that in Merchant this quarter is the slow restart after the long turndown in December that has extended into certainly early to mid-January. And Lunar New Year is upon us shortly, which will affect Asia volumes. But we do expect to see that pick back up in the third and fourth quarters.  And then a couple of points that you made. Certainly fracking is important at gas at $5.00 and above and right now gas is below $5.00 in North America as we know. And that has certainly slowed down that business a little bit. It’s hard to imagine that that level stays down there. That’s obviously down due to the lack of industrial demand for nat gas. So we would expect that to recover. The good news is that we have – the signings have stayed fairly solid across all regions. While things slowed down dramatically, here we’ve seen pretty good signings for across our applications base. And so that should continue to point us well towards volume growth. Obviously we’re going to need our customers that we have under contract right now to pick their volumes up as the economy rises. But there are no real systemic changes in the application interest of our customers. That seems to be progressing well.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities:  In the Merchant business, if we were to look at pricing trends on a sequential basis rather than year-over-year if you were to survey the major markets around the world, have you seen any examples of reversals or erosion of prices versus let’s say September levels? Or are the increases hanging in nicely?
Nelson Squires:  Simply put, Kevin, they are hanging in nicely. We have not seen any specific erosion and that comment pretty much carries globally for us.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  In terms of the first quarter results for Merchant and Tonnage in terms of operating income somewhat encouraging in terms of op income in year-over-year relative to volume decline, so when you think about ’09 in total embedded in your guidance is Merchant and Tonnage operating income going to be sort of like flattish to up, flattish to down at the end of the day?
Paul E. Huck:  If we take a look at the op income in 2009 what we should see is we ought to see the is in the Merchant area a decline in operating income but principally from what happens on the currency end of things. We are seeing a currency headwind here which I see the bulk in the Merchant Gases area, which is probably year-over-year about $0.50 a share right now in the forecast, Mike. And so if I then turn around and say on the Tonnage area I expect that to be about flat year-over-year. But the Merchant op income’s probably down year-over-year.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  And then I guess if you look at it then, Electronics and Performance Materials really takes the brunt of the year-over-year decline embedded in the EPS sort of guidance year-over-year.
Paul E. Huck:  A lot of it, yes. It takes a lot of it.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  It’s sort of masks the more defensive nature of your Merchant and Tonnage Gases business in a difficult environment. So strategically you’ve sort of looked at other businesses in the past, why is it then Electronics Performance Materials that you think makes sense longer term, considering its more cyclical nature? Sort of a business to keep, I mean.
Paul E. Huck:  Sure. Absolutely. And that is a fair question for people to ask and we obviously have had a very sharp decline in the economy here for this thing. And for right now, we are not happy with the results which we have gotten out of the business. We have to make the business a lot more stable over time and we have made a lot of changes in it. And we are going to continue to make those changes in the business and position us for the long term. And we want to be able to achieve a better margin in the business. And if we enter this time period with a better margin, it wouldn’t be as tough of a ride for us. And that’s one of the reasons why we want to get it. And you have to remember we don’t have any sacred cows around here. We are committed to trying to improve the business and we have shown that we can make improvements here, but if we can’t get it to the right place above our cost to capital we are going to take other actions on those businesses.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  At the end of the day will Electronics excluding the Performance Materials side be profitable by year-end?
Paul E. Huck:  As far as for the year, they should both make money yet. They should, but it’s going to be below the cost of capital for us and we have to get that above.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  In terms of energy costs considering where natural gas is, it should be down for you in ’09 versus ’08 and if you hold pricing that’s sort of a nice little bonus if you will in your outlook.
Paul E. Huck:  It does help but the thing which you have to think about on the energy side is that on the Tonnage business I’ve passed that through so I don’t get an impact. I will take the sales down but the profits will stay the same. Now on the other side of this is I do get an impact from the Merchant side but I do surcharge on the energy costs, so as the energy costs come down the surcharge is going to come off, too.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital:  On the tax rates, is 24% the number we should use for the rest of the year?
Paul E. Huck:  No. It is likely to be higher. We will probably finish the year somewhere 25 to 26% Sergey.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital:  And your interest income this time was a little bit lower than we expected although that hasn’t changed. Is it because the [libor] went lower and so should we expect similar number at least for the next couple of quarters?
Paul E. Huck:  Yes. Yes.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital:  On pensions, I think your projection for the full year impact based on your annual reports was about $170 million for the full year. I think the cash contribution this quarter was around $20 million. So has your view changed for the full year or this number will accel rates for the rest of the year?
Paul E. Huck:  No. We have not changed. I think the actual pension was about $40 million or so, the contributions net overall.
Operator:  Your last question comes from Chris Shaw – UBS.
Chris Shaw – UBS:  Just a quick over the guidance one more time. I’m sorry but for the second half guidance if you take your the mid-points of both Q2 and the full year and then for versus 2008 you add back the $0.10 from hurricane impacts and the fire at your Korean plant, and then if you take out say the $0.15 in cost cutting and the $0.10 in new plant, sort of your base business seems like the earnings are going to be down about 22% in the second half. Is that the right way of looking at it? I mean, will the base business be off that much?
Paul E. Huck:  I didn’t follow the – as far as the math is concerned. If I look at the second half is $2.61 a share in the second half for us. So what you’re saying is you’re adding back on the fire and the hurricane for us.
Chris Shaw – UBS:  Right. But then also for your second half guidance this year I took out cost cutting and the contribution from new plants.
Paul E. Huck:  Okay. All right. Okay. Yes if you take a look at the year-over-year for us, Chris, and the hit on volume total for the whole year is somewhere in the as far as sales are concerned somewhere around 10% to 12% when I look at the forecast for the year overall. And if you then take that out what you see is that it is a large amount, which is going to impact there. The big offset to that are the new plants coming on-stream and the impact also of the cost reductions for those things.  And the other thing which you have to look at is we have a headwind on currency which is somewhere $0.10 to $0.15 a share every quarter probably right now. And so that is something which, for the last half, that’s a $0.20 to $0.30 headwind so the impact of that is somewhere around a 10% drop in income if you think about it that way Chris.
Chris Shaw – UBS:  And then just quickly you said chemical operating rates at your customers were down 10 to 15%. What does that mean in volumes for you in Tonnage then? Are they down 10 to 15%?
Paul E. Huck:  Yes it does, about that.
Operator:  That does conclude today’s Question-and-Answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Squires for any closing remarks.
Nelson Squires:  Thanks Elizabeth. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2:00 PM today. Thank you for joining us and have a nice day.
Operator:  Once again that concludes today’s Air Products and Chemicals conference call. We thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.

Nelson Squires: Thank you, Shawn. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products quarterly earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today, our CEO, John McGlade; CFO, Paul Huck and I will review our fiscal 2008 results and 2009 outlook. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website, along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 pm Eastern time are also available on the website. Please turn to slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of today's earnings release. Before we start, please note that other than discontinued operations, we have not excluded any special or disclosed items from this quarter's results. However, in Q4 of last year, there were several items, which netted together, resulted in the gain of $0.17. This net gain is detailed in the appendix and notes to the earnings release, and is excluded from our prior year comparisons today. Also as a reminder, we've revised our business segment reporting. Europe Healthcare results are now being reported in the Merchant Gases segment. US Healthcare results are reported in discontinued operations. Prior periods have been restated to reflect this reporting change. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Huck: Thanks, Nelson. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Now, please turn to slide number 3. Before we look at this quarter's results, I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing fiscal year 2008. We entered in the year with goals of delivering our fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth and improving our operating margin to 15%. We delivered 18% earnings per share growth, and we approached our 15% margin goal as we decided to exit the US Healthcare business. Higher natural gas and raw material pass-through increased sales by more than $450 million, which effectively reduced operating margins by 70 basis points. Turning to our top-line. Sales growth of 14% included underlying volume and price gains of 6%, excluding the Equipment and Energy segment. Natural gas and raw material contractual pass-throughs accounted for 5%, and currency added 4%. Consolidated operating income growth of 12% was driven by Merchant, up 21% and Tonnage, up 13%. Performance materials showed significant improvement as well, but was partially offset by electronics, which declined as a result of a plant fire in Korea and weaker volumes in quarter four. Equipment and Energy segment income was down as expected. Equity affiliates' income grew 27% due to strength in Mexico, India, and South Africa, along with some favorable adjustments in quarter two and quarter three. Net income grew 16%, and we repurchased a significant amount of our shares for the fourth consecutive year. Our return on capital improved to 13%, up 50 basis points for the year. Additionally, we continue to improve our portfolio, having sold the Polymer Emulsions and High Purity Process Chemicals businesses, and we're continuing to make progress on selling our US homecare business. In summary, 2008 was another strong year of improvement for us, with continued progress towards our goals. Before I move on to the quarter, there has been broad media attention concerning liquidity, commercial paper access, and debt repayment obligations of corporations. Let me be clear. Our balance sheet is one of Air Products' strengths. We have a solid A rating and an A1/P1 commercial paper rating, and a $1.5 billion revolver to backstop that paper. We have had no issues with lenders or access to credit throughout this financial crisis. For next year, our long-term funding needs are minimal, as we only need to re-finance $37 million of maturing long-term debt. On the asset side, we have focused on lowering our DSO and it is down to 53 days from 58 days last year. Now turning to slide number 4 for a review of this quarter's consolidated financial results from continuing operations. As we announced on September 23rd, hurricanes along the Gulf Coast and a plant fire in Korea impacted quarter four, limiting our growth this quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 14% versus prior year. Underlying growth, excluding Equipment and Energy, was 4%, driven by better volumes and pricing in Merchant Gases and performance materials. Higher natural gas and raw material pass-through contributed 8%. Currency contributed 3%. Sales for the quarter were 2% lower due to the hurricanes. We continued to make progress reducing SG&A as a percentage of sales, and we are now at 10.1%. Operating income of $373 million was up 3% from prior year; again, due to better volumes and pricing, and also favorable currency. The plant fire and hurricanes, combined, reduced operating income by $28 million or 8%. Our operating margin declined 160 basis points versus last year. 110 basis points are due to higher natural gas and raw material costs pass-through. The hurricanes and plant fire reduced margins by 70 basis points. For the quarter, our net income and our diluted earnings per share increased by 7% and 10%, respectively. Now, let me turn to slide 5 and review the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our GAAP or as reported, earnings per share decreased $0.10, excluding discontinued operations and the prior year disclosed items, which resulted in the gain shown at the top of this slide, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew by $0.11 or 10%. Higher volumes added $0.06. Pricing and margins together, including energy and raw materials were favorable, netting to $0.03. Costs were unfavorable by $0.03. Favorable currency and foreign exchange added $0.07. The plant fire and hurricanes impacted us by $0.05 each. A lower effective tax rate added $0.04, and fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.03. Now, I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to slide 6, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases completed a strong year with a solid quarter. Sales of $1.1 billion were up 15% versus prior year. Pricing contributed 6%, volume 4% and currency added 5%. Sequentially, Merchant Gases sales grew 1%, with volumes contributing 1%, price 2% and currency reducing sales by 2%. Merchant Gases operating income of $196 million was up 12% versus prior year. Segment operating margin of 17.9% was down 50 basis points versus prior year, and 90 basis points versus prior quarter, due to an asset write-down. Let me now provide a few highlights by region. Please turn to slide 7. In North America, sales increased 14% versus prior year with volume growth contributing 5% and price 9%. Oxygen and nitrogen volumes increased versus prior year and prior quarter, despite some lost sales, due to the hurricanes. Oil field services continued to be strong. Our pricing actions continue to deliver, and we were able to recover the diesel cost increases that impacted us last quarter. Our latest price increase went into effect on the 1st of October. Capacity utilization was unchanged in the quarter. New business signings achieved a record for the fiscal year and were well ahead of target. We continue to see growth in energy and environmental applications. In Europe, sales increased 17% over prior year with price adding 5%, volumes 4% and currency 8%. As we discussed on our 23 September conference call, business continued to be generally soft in the UK and Southern Europe, though we did see a rebound in liquid bulk volumes in September. Capacity utilization was flat versus prior quarter in the UK, up slightly in the Northern Continent, and down slightly in the Southern Continent. Signings were solid and higher than previous-year. The numerous price actions we launched in the quarter were successful, and we expect that momentum to continue. In Asia, Merchant sales were up 12% over last year. Volumes contributed 4%, currency 3% and price 5%. We did see lower growth in China due to the Olympics and in Korea and Taiwan from electronics customers. The pricing actions launched in July are taking hold and are recovering energy and distribution cost increases. Please turn to slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $940 million grew 21% compared to last year. Natural gas and raw material pass-through increased sales by 25% and currency added 1%. The two Gulf Coast hurricanes lowered sales by 6%. Sequentially, sales were down 4% with currency reducing sales 1% and the hurricanes reducing sales 5%. Volumes would have been up 2% versus the third quarter, absent the hurricanes. Operating income of $135 million was up 14% compared to last year, and 7% versus last quarter. The increase over prior year was due to higher operating bonuses, lower maintenance costs and better operating efficiency. Operating margin of 14.3% decreased 90 basis points versus last year, due to higher natural gas costs. Sequentially, margins were up 140 basis points, due to lower natural gas costs, higher bonuses and lower maintenance costs. We just announced two major projects with ExxonMobil. The Baytown project represents an opportunity to sell hydrogen long-term from the available capacity on our Texas pipeline, while the Baton Rouge project is a major capacity addition to our existing pipeline franchise in Louisiana. Our Tonnage opportunities remained very exciting and we will have more to say about this in our outlook. Please turn to slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $553 million were up 6% compared to last year. Volume gains accounted for 3%, pricing added 2%, and currency 1%. Electronics sales were down 1% compared to last year, impacted by softer volumes, partially due to product rationalization efforts and lower equipment sales. In Performance Materials, volumes grew 4%, and our penetration of new products improved 30% versus prior year and now represents approximately 16% of our portfolio. Overall, operating income of $42 million was down 31% versus prior-year. Operating margin of 7.6% was down 400 basis points versus prior year, due to the impact of the fire and lower electronics pricing. Sequentially, margins were down due to the impact of the fire, and lower prices and volumes. We started supplying Signet Solar this quarter, and are nearing agreement on other photovoltaic opportunities. Please turn to slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $126 million in this segment increased 2% compared to last year and 18% sequentially, largely due to higher large air separation plant sales. Operating income of $16 million decreased 12% versus prior year due to lower LNG heat exchanger activity. Income was up versus prior quarter, primarily due to favorable cost performance. Our backlog of projects in this segment now totals $399 million. We received new orders in the quarter for two large air separation units, and we expect two to three LNG heat exchanger orders later in FY09. Now, I'll turn the call over to John McGlade.
John McGlade: Thanks, Nelson. Now if you will turn to slide 11, I'd like to share my thoughts on our fiscal year 2009 outlook. This is surely the most uncertain external environment since September 2001. In the past month, the economic outlook has turned decidedly negative, as the financial crisis has worsened. Although forecasting at this time involves a high degree of uncertainty, we are currently projecting the following. Globally, we saw manufacturing grow between 3% to 4% in fiscal year '08, with momentum slowing sharply in the last quarter. We now expect global manufacturing growth of 1% to 2% for our fiscal year 2009. Our current thinking is that in the United States, we will see a decline of 1% to 2% in manufacturing. We expect to see Europe decline 1% to 2% as well, with growth in Central and Eastern Europe, and declines in the rest of Europe. We expect Asia, will continue to be the strongest area, growing 5% to 6%. Based on this economic outlook, we are forecasting our fiscal 2009 earnings from continuing operations to be between $5.10 and $5.35 per share, which represents year-on-year earnings growth of 1% to 6%. Let me now turn to our outlook by business segment. We expect to bring 20 new plants on-stream in the fiscal year, representing nearly $0.5 billion of new capital, which will help drive growth. Capacity utilization remains relatively strong globally, and our efforts to raise prices and increase productivity should generate continued improvement in our Merchant Gases segment next year. In addition, we will continue to benefit from the strong business signings we have won over the past year. We are targeting a 1% improvement in margins for fiscal year 2009, and to be above 20% in fiscal year 2010. In the United States, we are continuing to operate at a high rate across our system. Therefore to serve volume growth, we will continue to debottleneck plants and convert larger liquid customers to small on-sites. In Europe, we're continuing to focus on improving our margins by raising our prices, streamlining business operations, and continuing to drive our shared service model into this region. In Asia Merchant Gases, we continue to expand our technology applications and offerings, and that, along with solid manufacturing growth, will continue to increase demand, loading our new capacity. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see some benefit from new facilities, loading and productivity, with a full year impact of our second Petro-Canada plant and six other large plants which we will bring on-stream this year. On the new order front, refinery hydrogen project development remains active. And in 2010, we expect to bring on the two ExxonMobil contracts we just announced, as well as Marathon Oil, Garyville and Total, Port Arthur. In Equipment and Energy, we expect profits to decline about $0.05 per share, due to lower LNG activity. We do anticipate signing two to three LNG orders this coming year, although these orders won't have a significant impact on our fiscal year 2009 profits. Within Electronics, silicon process was up 4% to 5% in fiscal year '08. We expect it to be flat to down 5% in 2009. As we look at fiscal 2009, we expect weaker demand across foundries, memory, and flat-panel producers in the first half of the year, with a pick-up in the second half. Our growth expectations in Performance Materials are based on the assumption that we can grow through a combination of share gain, new market and application successes, and from new products, as we have in the past. For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we continue to target improvement in our operating margins with a goal of delivering 15% in 2010. In this economic environment, cost control and reduction are important drivers of earnings, margin and return improvement. For fiscal year 2009, we are taking a number of actions. As would be expected, we have already cutback on discretionary spending, significantly reducing travel, use of consultants, new programs and hiring. We will also see the impact of a number of structural cost reductions we are making to reach our 2010 goal of 17%. Examples of these actions include continuing to capitalize on our SAP investment to further lower our finance, IT and customer service costs by using shared services globally and simplifying and automating our transaction processes. These actions will continue to drive down our SG&A costs. We are also increasing energy efficiency of our plants by using Six Sigma techniques to reduce the variation in plant operations, therefore decreasing the natural gas consumption of our HYCO facilities and the power consumption of our air separation units. We are lowering our maintenance costs through the utilization of our system wide SAP data on our facilities to optimize maintenance scheduling and to leverage our global buying power. And we are reducing our distribution expense per unit of product delivered through investment in more fuel efficient equipment and more efficient route and delivery scheduling. While we are likely to see an uncertain economy in 2009, we remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle. Turning to slide 10. Our guidance for quarter one, is for earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.21 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas, higher prices in Merchant Gases; a much smaller impact from quarter four's plant fire and hurricane and improvement from our cost reduction actions. Offsetting these sequential improvements are a number of seasonal impacts in our businesses. In Merchant Gases and Performance Materials, we will see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, we expect higher maintenance spending and lower volumes in quarter one and lower operating performance bonuses. In addition as expected, our LNG activity will be lower, and we anticipate a higher tax rate in quarter one versus quarter four, and a currency headwind from a stronger dollar. Please now turn to slide 13, for our capital spending outlet. In the longer-term, we see excellent demand for our products and significant opportunities for growth. Despite the recent decline, energy prices remain historically high and are likely to continue to do so. There will also be significant activity around alternative energy and climate change initiatives, which should also drive much higher demand for industrial gases in both our Merchant and Tonnage segments. We continue to work on opportunities for the future. These include hydrogen for clean fuels; oxygen for gasification of coal, petroleum coke and other heavy carbon materials to produce both power and petrochemicals; and oxygen for capturing carbon emissions. These opportunities are driving increased capital spending in 2009 and beyond. We are currently forecasting our CapEx to be $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, up from $1.4 billion in 2008. This forecast is slightly lower than our previous forecast, due to the stronger dollar, since a significant portion of our spending is outside the United States; lower project costs, as commodity pricing has declined; and an allowance for some customer project delays due to the financial crisis and its impact on global economic demand. This spending is broken down between $400 million for maintenance and support capital, and $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for growth. Of the growth expenditures, approximately 60% are in our Tonnage segment. As we stated before, each dollar of CapEx, growth CapEx translates to about 70% of revenue growth two years out. In closing, I'm on the call today to assure you that the 20,000 Air Products employees, most of whom are shareholders, are committed to delivering increased shareholder value. We are taking the actions to deliver our 2009 guidance, while continuing to take advantage of our excellent market opportunities in the future. We are ready for this challenge. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Shawn to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). We will start with David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you, good morning.
Paul Huck: Good morning, Dave.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: John, could you quantify the impact of the 20 new plants in Merchant and the six new plants in Tonnage on the sales and earnings in 2009?
John McGlade: Yes. The 20 plants in total include the six, that's about $0.5 billion of CapEx. And as we've said, that CapEx should translate into about $0.70 on the dollar in terms of revenue.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Given the locked-in growth from those projects, how would $5.10 be realized? What would be declining in the business, Electronics I assume, Performance Materials?
Paul Huck: Yeah, Dave. And if you take a look at our guidance and you think through that, one of the things which doesn't come across actually in the numbers for the thing we talked is the currency headwind which we're facing. So, if you take a look at this, I estimate that we probably are facing about a $0.30 to a $0.35 a share headwind in currency, allowing for a euro somewhere in the $1.30 range and appropriate other currencies as you go out there. We're also exposed to the won, the Taiwan dollar, the pound, etcetera. So that's a headwind. The other thing is we have equipment as John talked about, which is a headwind of about nickel from there. So if you look at that, the volume growth which we have locked-in, continues about $0.30 a share next year, as I can look at it right now Dave. So that translates to a 5% or 6% gain in our EPS just from the volume, which we have.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And Paul, last. What's the benefit from cost and productivity actions in '09?
Paul Huck: We're probably somewhere in $0.10 to $0.20.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we'll go to our next question from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Hi, good morning. If I could start with a question of clarification. In your press release, you say that the effects of the fire are in other income. Is that other income on a consolidated basis or other income on a segment basis?
Paul Huck: On a consolidated basis, Jeff.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay.
Paul Huck: On the line on the P&L.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay. So if what we do is, we add back the $15 million to your $42 million in operating income in Electronics, we get $57 million. And you had positive volumes, positive price and positive currency. Your sales are up roughly from $520 million to $550 million, but the operating profits are down, and this even adjusted for the fire, and this is the area where you've intensely focused on cost reduction. So why is that?
Paul Huck: Well, one of the things is that we did have extra costs, obviously, in this quarter in the Electronics area for us. If you look at the other aspect of that thing is that price in Electronics was down year-over-year for us. In the slide, what you see is 2% price gain. A lot of that is in the performance end of the business, that's recovery of the raw materials aspect of that. And so, on net that is a positive. If you look just at the Electronics portion of the business, as we've talked about this before, we continue to see declines in our special materials pricing. So the 2% price is a net of those two. The 2% price really is recovery of the raw material costs in the performance end of the business.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay. Finally, I think John McGlade in his preliminary remarks said that you still maintain your 15% margin target for Electronics and Performance Materials for 2010. So you're at 11% now and you're projecting negative volumes for next year or for most of the next year? So how are you going to get from 11% to 15% with no volume growth?
Paul Huck: First in 2010, we are going to project growth in 2010. In fact, if you look at this Jeff, I think the way in which John phrased is, we're expecting the first quarter and the second quarter of the year to be down and then start to see a pick-up in the third and fourth quarters, continuing into 2010.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay. And then I guess lastly, what's the millions of standard cubic feet that you've just booked with ExxonMobil for the two contracts?
Paul Huck: It is about 160, I believe.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: For the two combined?
Paul Huck: For the two combined.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: All right, and we will go next to PJ Juvekar of Citi.
Paul Huck: Good morning, PJ.
PJ Juvekar - Citi: Yes, hi good morning. I don't understand your CapEx guidance. At the midpoint of your CapEx guidance, it will go up, CapEx will go up 20%. You're saying that operating profit will go up only 1% to 6%. So your return on capital is going to fall. That suggests that you're going after projects with marginal returns. Can you just talk us through that, why are you raising your CapEx if you are expecting earnings growth to be lower?
Paul Huck: PJ, if what you look at is the CapEx, which we are spending next year, is going to go principally into the construction and progress account for those things. So, what that does is, a lot of that CapEx comes on two years from now. So we'll have some of it come on in 2010, as John talked about, and then other come on in 2011. And so, the sales and profit impact really of this these things is one to two years out.
PJ Juvekar - Citi: But you and the rest of the industry, you ramped up your capital spending, as the returns are going down. Are you just worried long-term that returns could be lower and the oligopoly that we had expected, this may not work out as people expected?
John McGlade: No, P.J. As we've talked before, this is John. We are constantly focused on looking at the quality of the returns of the projects that we have. We aren't deteriorating the returns on the projects that we're taking on. The CapEx ramp-up, which is largely in the Tonnage segment, is a direct function of the opportunities that exist in the energy sector.
PJ Juvekar - Citi: Okay. On that, with oil below $70, some of these projects like enhanced oil recovery or even Canadian tar sands, is there any anticipation of slowdown in any of these projects?
John McGlade: This is John again. I mean, in our guidance, we did lower our forecast for this year a bit from what we had been out saying a couple of quarters ago. I still think, however, the fundamentals of basically the North American demand for transportation fuels and the security of supply that the tar sands or the oil sands offer to that very large marketplace really, really does bode well for the long-term development of those reserves. Certainly, as oil has come down to this price range, we believe these projects make sense in the broader North American dynamics. And then quite honestly, the pressure that had been on the resources to execute all of these projects that had been announced, really made for a fairly high escalation of the cost and the tight demand on resources. So there's probably a little bit of natural sorting out of that oil curve. But our view long-term for the prospects here is still very bright.
PJ Juvekar - Citi: Right. For short-term, maybe some slowdown, but long-term you are positive?
John McGlade: Absolutely. And the short-term, we've tried to build into our revised CapEx.
PJ Juvekar - Citi: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Peter Butler of Glen Hill Investors.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investors: Good morning. Is there a bigger picture on your Exxon contracts? What does this do to your competitive position on the Gulf Coast versus, say, Praxair? Are there any longer-term implications on raising your market share? What about possibilities of follow-on business with Exxon at other locations around the world? Do these contracts say that you have a significantly improved position with the company?
John McGlade: Well, first off Peter, in this business, it's never been about market share from our perspective. It's been about really generating projects that give us returns that are consistent with our goals and objectives. Certainly these two projects with Exxon, we're very pleased to be the supplier to these. We believe that we won these on the basis of our ability to provide the value proposition that Exxon expects. We are obviously, in the supply of hydrogen to any refinery, we're a critical element to the ability of that refinery to run and to run consistently without interruption. I think having been at this game the longest, we've been able to demonstrate that the best of our competitors. As you know, each and every one of these projects, given the large scale of them, tend to be discrete decisions, that among other things are based on your credibility in the marketplace, your relationship and credibility and the fact that you've been able to prove to that particular customer through years of operating experience, that you can deliver the value proposition that they're expecting.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investors: I guess what I was looking for was your thoughts that your experience to date and including winning these two contracts would in fact, improve your betting average on contracts yet to be negotiated and completed.
John McGlade: Well, I think from the standpoint of, I'm not going to speak specifically to ExxonMobil, but from the standpoint of my earlier comments on the market positioning, I think the market is, and in this case, on these two, ExxonMobil is voting that we do have a compelling value proposition. I think on future projects, we really have to talk to them.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investors: Okay. Great. Thanks for your help, guys.
John McGlade: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, good morning guys. A couple of questions. One, John, where is the incremental demand from Exxon coming from? Is that a de-captivation of existing, or are they going to adjust their refinery and need more hydrogen? Or why did you get that incremental business?
John McGlade: Well, in both cases, I think that they are just moving towards a greater transportation fuel production. Some of it's probably related to some of the diesel regulations that came into play. It's really an incremental debottleneck at both facilities, the one in Baytown and the one in Baton Rouge.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Got you. Then your well respected economist seems to have a much more pessimistic view than the IMF or some others in terms of his economic forecast. So, do you think that's a reflection of some stuff you've seen more recently in extrapolating that forward or are you just being particularly cautious? Why such a somber outlook compared to maybe what others have said?
Paul Huck: Bob, I think it pays to be conservative at this point in time from our plans on everything. As John said, it's a place in which the uncertainty is very high here. I would rather add on this, here on the downside, I'm not going to miss anything, but I'll be prepared for the worst things, we think. The other thing is that, I'm the first out on the full year.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Then lastly, if I might, a lot of your on-site projects are based on achieving some sort of return on capital target. How much wiggle room is there in your own procurement of raw materials, ENC constant labor cost, and that sort of thing where you could actually get an improved margin as the global deflation starts to take hold a bit?
Paul Huck: That is possible for us. It's one of the things in which we put forth, as far as the change in the capital outlook. We expect the commodity prices to bring capital costs down by a bit also.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Do you share that with your customer if that happened or not?
Paul Huck: Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't, it depends upon the contract.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thanks very much.
Paul Huck: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy, Banc of America Securities.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Yes, good morning. Would you elaborate on what you're seeing in Asia in the Merchant Gases business? Obviously, volume decelerated to 4% from 15% last quarter. But I know it's an unusual quarter with the Olympics, and a lot of macro volatility. So, as you look to the first half of '09, would you expect to rebound from that level, continued pressure? What's your outlook there?
Nelson Squires: Hey Kevin, this is Nelson. Yeah, we've looked at this pretty closely, obviously. Most of the slowness that we would see is due to the Olympics and the Para Olympics period. In addition to that, certainly some Merchant volume going to Electronics customers in Taiwan and Korea has slowed a bit. One of the things to point out here though is that, overall from a macro standpoint, we have been short of molecules in many regions in Asia, and have brought on plants in China, Korea, and Taiwan to serve what I'll call the general market. So we do expect to see some volume kick from that this fiscal year, because ultimately capacity is still pretty tight there. So we do expect to see volumes bounce back and we do expect to see decent volume growth in Asian this year.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And then on the pricing side in Merchant, I think you had some relatively recent increases just about three weeks ago, on October 1st.
Nelson Squires: Right.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Given that it's early, what is your experience in terms of realizations and customer push-back relative to prior rounds of increases?
Nelson Squires: It has not changed, which means it's still very positive in terms of the effectiveness of the increases. I mean the key point is, as we spoke to in the script, the first part of the call, was the capacity utilization is still pretty tight, we haven't seen any movement in North America. By the way, we and a few of our competitors have actually brought on capacity this year. It's been incremental capacity as you know, but that has been basically taken into the market. We are, so far, as good or better than expected on these latest increases.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Final question for Paul, if I may, on the subject of repurchases. Do you have any thoughts on the pace of future repurchases given the volatility in the capital markets?
Paul Huck: It's certainly something which we are going to pay a lot of attention to Kevin, because we want to have the funds to address the market needs and stuff like that. But as we maintain our debt rating today, and our commercial paper in A1/P1, and if we go out and have the additional cash over that which under this plan, we would project to still have even with the capital spending which I have here, we will go back and buy back shares. I probably would not do that in advance or in anticipation of earnings, though.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Thank you very much.
Paul Huck: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll go next to Chris Shaw of UBS.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Good morning. How are you doing?
Paul Huck: Hi, Chris.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Just given to sort of where the Energy markets are going, do you have any expectations for lower hydrogen volumes in the Tonnage business for 2009 or do you think those will hold up? Is there a big spread between what you guys have been earning? What are the take levels?
Paul Huck: Yes, if you look on the refineries in the US. The refineries have continue to operate in the mid 80s. And so, we would anticipate that to continue, Chris. So no, it's not a factor in there and we don't expect to see it.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Then general, on your 2009 guidance, what sort of expectations do you have in there for pricing year-over-year?
Paul Huck: Yes, the pricing is already in there. A lot of it, a lot of the improvements year-over-year are included in there. As you can see, we went out on the 1st of October in the US to raise prices and we're continuing to raise prices in places like Europe and Asia also. The capacity still looked very good across the globe for us.
Chris Shaw - UBS: But there's not like a discrete number in there, a number like 2% up?
Paul Huck: No. But the thing I said is, if I take a look at the overall pricing, cost mix for us, I think it's $0.10 to $0.20 positive this year for us.
Chris Shaw - UBS: In 2008?
Paul Huck: 2008 to 2009.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay. Were there any energy surcharges you had for delivery that might be coming off because of lower gasoline cost?
Paul Huck: We did have surcharges on diesel, and if diesel comes off and stays down, they will come off.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay. Great, thanks a lot.
Operator: We will go next to Don Carson of Merrill Lynch.
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. 2009 is shaping up to be another 2001 in terms of a downturn. This time around, you see an improvement in earnings in a recession versus a slight deterioration last time. What gives you that confidence? Is it the portfolio improvements you've made since the last recession? Is it that the higher backlog? What exactly gives you the confidence that you can do better in a recession than you did last time?
John McGlade: Well, Don, it's frankly a combination of both of those things. As you well know, we have worked really hard at transforming the portfolio of this company, but also at transforming the foundation of how we execute our business. Then when you combine that with some of the growth that we have locked-in, the applications that we do see, certainly a better discipline on our side in terms of the investments in aspects of our business and maintaining a much higher utilization rate in the operation of our businesses. We worked really hard to get here, and this management team is absolutely focused on doing what we've said we were going to do, which is to perform during an economic downturn.
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch: Just a couple of follow-ups on the backlog. You mentioned that backlog is at an all-time high. Can you quantify that in dollar terms or number of projects? You talked about building in or factoring in some delays in the backlog, but what cancellation potential is there in the backlog, can you comment on that?
Paul Huck: Well Don, as far as the cancellation potential, if that were to happen, we would have coverage on our costs. Now, the likelihood of projects being canceled I think is quite small. I am not concerned about that, and we have factored something in for projects delaying a little bit. So I think we are in good shape there. With regard to the size of the backlog, it is currently about $2.5 billion in spending. The other portion about that is that the bulk of this is in the Tonnage area with 60% to 65% of that being in the Tonnage area.
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch: Paul, just one clarification. I don't know if you had mentioned this before, what's your assumption on the foreign currency headwind in 2009 from an EPS standpoint?
Paul Huck: EPS, it's $0.30 to $0.35 Don.
Don Carson - Merrill Lynch: Alright, okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies: Hi, this is Lucy Watson sitting in for Laurence.
Paul Huck: Good morning, Lucy.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies: Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, that $2.5 billion in spending, that's capital spending, right?
Paul Huck: That is a backlog in projects. The capital spending for '09 is going to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies: Okay. Have you clarified or do you know what the impact of pensions will be on 2009 earnings and cash flow?
Paul Huck: About flat.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies: Okay. What is the contribution to Merchant Gases profits from the European Healthcare business?
Paul Huck: That is disclosed, it runs profits about $23 million to $24 million a quarter.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies: Okay. Just one more. At what point would you expect to start cutting CapEx spending? Are there any external indicators that we could possibly look at or that you look at to track for cutting back?
Paul Huck: On the CapEx, the thing which everyone should realize is that is driven by us, and having the product sold, and the customers. So, the customer base is there. So, I would not anticipate a cutback in CapEx.
Lucy Watson - Jefferies: Thank you.
Paul Huck: You're welcome.
Operator: Alright, we'll go to Mike Harrison of First Analysis.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Hi, good morning. In the past, you've talked about improving your plant efficiency and how the savings are larger when energy costs are higher. I was wondering if you're still moving forward with as many plant efficiency projects, now that energy prices have come a little bit lower and how are you looking at those projects longer-term?
Paul Huck: Mike, they have come a little bit lower, but if you look at the cost of power, if you look at the cost of gas, it's still two to three times the historical rate. So the benefits of these things look good. No, we would not back off. As we try and take a look at this stuff, I'm not factoring in $150 a barrel oil or $12 gas in the economics long-term to make these things work.
John McGlade: The only build I'd put to that is, is the fact, the comment I made around utilizing Six Sigma techniques advanced tools, getting better, tighter operating capability around our plants, gives us opportunities to do this that don't always require a lot of capital investment in the facility to achieve these returns or improvements.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: As you see, maybe some slowing or delays in your growth CapEx or in some of the projects from your customers, do you have kind of a backlog of your own of plant efficiency projects that you can put into the pipeline to make those higher priority in a slower economic environment?
John McGlade: That's a great question. Of course, I'll go back to the point Paul made a moment ago. We're watching the capital stock that we're executing very closely. But these additions are largely in our Tonnage business. They are largely tied to contracts that are either executed or working under some sort of a commercial agreement. So, our view is that we've got a reasonable CapEx forecast here for the next couple of years, or for next year, and expect similar type going forward. Having said that, you're absolutely correct in the fact that you're constantly balancing the trade-off of resources between executing against your growth capital, while continuing to optimize the asset base you have. That would certainly be a lever we would pull. What we're really trying to do is ensure that we can do both of these things in the environment that we're in.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Alright. Then looking at the Merchant business and the performance you showed in Europe this quarter, it looks like the strongest organic growth that you've shown there all year. I was wondering if you could explain why that was the case, given what we're hearing about slowing in Europe? At least the things I've heard, that August slowed down significantly and September didn't really pick up like it normally does.
Nelson Squires: Hi Mike, this is Nelson. Our September volumes in liquid bulk did pick up. So we were obviously happy to see that. But the growth is really being driven by new application successes. A couple of specific applications that were out there are proliferating in the European markets, some of the things that we've carried over from success in the US. We would basically attribute all of that gain or a lot of that gain, certainly, to new application success, Energy related as well.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Do you think that you guys can hit the 6% to 7% underlying growth rate that you had talked about for Merchant in Europe?
Paul Huck: The 6% to 7% of growth which we talked about previously, it really applied to the whole company. And right now in the economic forecast, which I have in here, it's probably about 5% overall.
Operator: Okay. We'll go to our next question from Mike Judd of Greenwich Consultants.
Mike Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Yes, thanks. I'm just wondering if you could give me a little bit of an update on your pension plans and how they are structured. You mentioned to an earlier question that you don't expect any additional or any increase in the level of funding for the next fiscal year. Can you just walk us through that, given that some of the equity markets are down?
Paul Huck: Mike, sure. As we look at our pension plan, the major plan which I have exists in the US. The unfunded liability overall is about $400 million. I would not anticipate it to get a lot larger this year, because the other thing which is going to happen is that the rate of the discount rate to calculate the PBO and ABO are is actually going up. So, I think we're going to be fine there.
Mike Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Thank you.
Paul Huck: Yes.
Operator: We'll go next to Mark Gulley of Soleil Securities.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Good morning, guys. A couple of questions.
John McGlade: Good morning.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: With respect to the Texas opportunity, I guess Baytown, Texas for Exxon, it sounded like you have available capacity in that pipeline system, which you're making available for this new application. Is that correct that your operating rates there are perhaps low enough that you already had the capacity for Exxon in Baytown?
John McGlade: Well, it is available capacity in our system, but it's also consistent with our strategy on our franchises, which is, you add discrete plants on large requirements, but then you try to add plants that fit either a standard envelope or an actual size to be added. And it's a real opportunity to put a little bit of extra capacity on a facility in a franchise such as Texas or Louisiana, where you have substantial network of pipes, multiple customers feeding, and taking product in and out of that system. So this is just a natural progression of how we develop any franchise over time.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Particularly, I want to talk about the economic forecast. I actually thought it was a little bit more optimistic than I would have thought. It seems to me like this recession is going to be very much more global than the '01 recession, like both, the consumer and industrial customers are going to get hit here pretty hard. So I would have thought that perhaps the outlook from your economist would have been more somber than it is?
Paul Huck: Thanks.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Can you elaborate on why this one is going to be the way you think it is?
Paul Huck: Well, I think if you take a look at what we have predicted, what we're showing is a drop in the manufacturing climate which is about equal to the 2001 area right now for us. It's going to be global, we think, because of the crisis which has gone global also, and the mood of consumers. It is below the consensus though right now, Mark. So it is worse than a lot of people are predicting at this point in time.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Finally, I know all Energy projects have individual energy cost thresholds, but if oil were to continue to fall, are there any projects, any applications which really do get pushed aside if oil or natural gas falls a whole lot more?
John McGlade: Certainly, this is not an exact science; it's an art. It really gets down to, frankly, most of the time our customers in planning for a new project are not planning at the current price of oil on that day, but generally a much more normalized cost of oil, if you will, over a longer period of time. But clearly, one of the first areas that go when you get down to lower thresholds would be natural gas, probably down around $5 per 1 million BTUs. So that's more of a hit to the Merchant business, should that occur. On the longer-term, as I mentioned on the longer-term projects driven off of energy, I don't think any of our customers were planning anywhere near the scenario of the oil prices that we saw throughout this summer.
Mark Gulley - Soleil Securities: Thanks, John.
Operator: Alright. We'll go to our next question from Mike Sison of KeyBanc.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Hi. When you think about the 20 plants or so you're bringing on next year, The odds of a cancellation considering that it's so close to being built, your customers must be well financed, must have their plan on the go. It's pretty low, right?
Paul Huck: It is zero.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Okay. And then when you think about the backlog that you have, the 1.6, 1.8, is that all growth or there is some maintenance CapEx in there?
Paul Huck: The maintenance CapEx is about $400 million.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Okay.
Paul Huck: The 1.2 to 1.4 of spending in '09 on growth, and a growth backlog of about 2.5 right now.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Right. And historically, why does a customer cancel? Is it that they don't get financing? They go bankrupt? Historically, I do know that you don't have a lot of cancellations, but if there has been some, why did they cancel?
Paul Huck: We rarely see a cancellation in this business. We're more likely to see our delays and not cancellations.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Right. And the reason you're confident is that, within the CapEx backlog are actual customers who have signed a long-term, five or 15-year contract?
Paul Huck: Yes.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Okay. Then, John, when you take a look at return on capital of 13% for '08, I didn't really have time to do the math, but when you look at your guidance for '09, is there improvement there? Then when you look longer-term to 2010, can you give us sort of, maybe direction to where you think return to capital should go?
John McGlade: Well, I'll let Paul address the specifics, but our goal is to continue to improve our return on capital. I mean, part of our challenge to ourselves and our commitment to our shareholders is to drive our margins to 17%, which would in turn translate into a return on capital of around 15% type of ROCE number.
Paul Huck: That's what our goal is out there, it is to take the margins up and drive the returns up along with that, Mike.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Will there be some improvement next year?
Paul Huck: Yes, a little bit.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Okay.
Paul Huck: That's right.
Mike Sison - KeyBanc: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: That's all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Squires for any additional or closing remarks.

Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Thank you, Amy. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products quarterly earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our third quarter results. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time are also available on the website. Please turn to slide two. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of today's earnings release. Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Nelson. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Now please just turn to slide number three, before we look it this quarter's results I would like to spend a few minute updating you on several portfolio management items. First as we mentioned last quarter, we were marketing our remaining emulsions properties enclosed on the sale of those facilities to Ashland on June 30th. Second, we have completed the review of our strategic alternatives for our U.S. Healthcare business. As part of our review process we performed an asset impairment test and have recorded $315 million impairment charge this quarter. We also reviewed our options for the business with our Board last week. We have approval to sell the business and have already started the process. We have reached an agreement in principle to sell our business in New York and New Jersey, which represents about 10% of our U.S. Healthcare business sales. We expect to close on this transaction in the fourth quarter. Regarding the remaining U.S. business, we have solicited and received a number of indications of interest in the business. And we are in currently in discussions with those potential buyers. As a result of our Board approval, we will begin reporting the U.S. Healthcare business in discontinued operations starting in quarter four. We will also move the leadership of our European Healthcare business into our Merchant business, reporting it as part of that segment. Prior to our earnings announcement for the quarter, we will provide you with restated segment information. This transaction will have a favorable impact on a number of key metrics we are working to improve. The sale of business should improve earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.11 in 2008. It will also improve our return on capital employed by 30 basis points and operating margin by 70 basis points. As shown in the U.S. Healthcare results and our pension settlement our year-to-date operating margin would be 14.9%. Now let me turn to slide four, and review the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our GAAP or as reported EPS decreased 75%, excluding discontinuing operations and the disclosed items shown at the top of this slide adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew by $0.20 or 18%. Higher volumes added $0.06. Pricing and margins together including energy and raw materials were unfavorable netting to $0.02. Favorable currency and foreign exchange added $0.06. Higher equity affiliate income contributed $0.06 as we continue to see good growth in operating performance in a number of countries. About half of this is attributable to U.S. GAAP adjustments made by several affiliates in Asia. Fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.03, all other items net contributed $0.01. Now turning to slide number five, for a review of this quarters consolidated financial results from continuing operations excluding the U.S. Healthcare charge. As you can see, we had another good quarter. We are continuing to make progress on our 2008 financial targets. For the quarter, sales grew 16% versus prior year. Underlying growth excluding equipment and energy was 5% driven by better volumes in our Merchant and Electronics and Performance Materials segments and higher pricing in Merchant Gases. Higher natural gas and raw material pass through contributed 7%, currency contributed 5%. We continue to make progress reducing SG&A expense as a percentage of sales and we are now at 11.4%. Operating income of $382 million was up 9% from prior year, again due to better volumes and pricing and also favorable currency. Our operating margin declined 100 basis points versus last year entirely due to higher natural gas and raw material cost pass through. Lower equipment and energy results further reduced our margins. However, this was offset by underlying performance improvement in our Merchant, Tonnage, and Electronic and Performance Materials segments. With the improvements we are forecasting for quarter four, we are on track to achieve our operating margin goal of 15% for the year excluding U.S. Healthcare. For the quarter, our net income and our diluted earnings per share increased by 16% and 18% respectively. Our return on capital improved with return on capital employed increasing to 12.5% up 50 basis points from last year. Now Ill turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to slide six, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases grew at a solid pace during the quarter. Sales of $973 million were up 19% versus prior year. Currency contributed 8% and volume contributed 5%, pricing added 4% and acquisitions 2%. Merchant Gases operating income of $177 million was up 20% versus prior year and segment operating margin of 18.2% was up 20 basis points. Mainly, due to pricing and volume gains margins were down sequentially by 30 basis points due to significantly higher energy and fuel cost in May and June. Let me now provide a few highlights by region. Please turn to slide seven. In North America, our sales increased to 11% driven by continued strong pricing gains and solid volume growth. We are seeing the expected volume growth in oxygen and nitrogen versus last year, realizing the impact of new business signings from previous quarters. Liquid nitrogen for oil field services was also very strong in the quarter. We are bringing on previously announced capacity at three of our facilities and are pleased with the loading and returns on these news expansions. Pricing continued its strong trend, however, we were not able to keep up with rising energy cost in the quarter. In this quarter alone we saw an unprecedented 30% increase in the cost of diesel fuel. Diesel is now up over 50% versus prior year. We implemented another fuel surcharge on 1 July our third this year to recover the most recent cost increases which haven't incurred since our previous surcharge implementation on 1 May, 2008. We expect this action to help drive improvement in our overall segment margins in the fourth quarter. New business signings continued their strong pace in the quarter and this fiscal year will be our best ever in terms of both quantity and quality of signings. In Europe sales increased 23% over prior year with price adding 3%, volumes 1%, currency 15%, and acquisitions 4%. Business continued to be generally soft in the UK and Spain. Plant utilization remains high on the continent. Signings were strong in the quarter especially in the UK where we have prior product available. We are also beginning to see the impact of increased volumes as a result of new signings in previous quarters. Pricing was solid and we are in the process of launching several actions across Europe to address rising energy cost. In Asia, Merchant sales were up 21% over last year, volumes contributed 15%, currency 4%, and price 2%. Similar to our other regions on July 1st, we implemented price increases in China, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia to recover energy costs. Please turn to slide eight, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $976 million increased 26% compared to last year. Volumes were flat versus prior year as new plants on-streams were offset by lower spot sales. Natural gas and raw material prices were higher versus prior year and added 23%, while currency added 3%. Sequentially, volumes were down 3% due to lower refinery run-rates. Operating income of $126 million was up 4% compared to last year and 13% versus prior quarter due to improved operating efficiencies. Operating margin of 12.9% was 260 basis points lower than last year, held down by significantly higher natural gas cost pass through. This impacted margins sequentially as well though the impact was offset by performance bonuses and improved operating efficiency. We announced two significant contract signings in the quarter with U.S. Steel and Nanticoke, Ontario, Canada and Total at Port Arthur, Texas. New business activity continues at a solid pace and we expect to announce additional signed agreements in the near future. Please turn the slide nine, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $580 million were up 9% compared to last year. Volumes were up 6%, pricing 1% and currency contributed 2%. Electronic sales were up 5% compared to last year driven by higher sales in specialty materials and tonnage and offset by lower equipment sales in the skew reduction effort. Excluding equipment in the skew reduction effort, sales increased 20%. Electronic sales were down 1% sequentially due to lower equipment sales. Ex-equipment, sales increased 4%. In Performance Materials overall volumes grew 5% versus prior year and 7% sequentially. Continued weakness in North America was more than offset by strong sales to Asian customers. Overall operating income of $70 million was up 13% versus prior year. Operating margin of 12.1% was up 40 basis points versus prior year. We expect to see continued margin improvement in the current quarter, as the cost to support the skew reduction efforts will be largely behind us and the full benefits of the restructuring effort will begin to take hold. While capital spending in the semiconductor industry has slowed as expected in 2008 we were successful in winning two FAB awards in Asia during the quarter. Bid activity has also begun to pick up. Activity level in the Total Voltaic [ph] area continues to be very high as well. Please turn the slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $107 million in this segment decreased due to lower L&G activity. Operating income of $4 million decreased versus prior year and prior quarter. Our backlog of projects now totals $228 million. We signed agreements for two larger separation units in the quarter which have been added to the backlog. Please turn to slide 11, Healthcare. Healthcare segment sales of a $172 million were up 9% compared to prior year, due primarily to currency. Sequentially sales were up 1%, reflecting continued solid results in Europe. Excluding the impairment charge, operating income of $13 million was up 54% versus prior year and higher European results and currency. Operating margins were at 7.6%, improving 220 basis points versus prior year. Our margins improved 210 basis points sequentially due to strong performance in Europe. Now, I will turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Nelson. Now if you will turn to slide 12. Now let's take a look at our guidance. As I mentioned earlier we'll be moving to U.S. healthcare business to discontinued operations in quarter four. On a continuing operations bases this will add $0.07 to 2007, and $0.11 to our 2008 guidance. Therefore the equivalent range to our 2008 $4.95 to $5.05 guidance would now be $5.06 to $5.16. Based upon the third quarter improvements and a strong outlook for quarter four we are raising this range $0.10 on the bottom and $0.05 on the top, to $5.16 to $5.21 and now expect to deliver 21% to 22% growth in 2008 versus last year. Year-to-date ex-U.S. healthcare and pension settlement charge, we have earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.79. This gives us fourth quarter guidance of $1.37 to $1.42. Turning to slide number thirteen. As we look forward from quarter three to quarter four we see the following. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. In Merchant Gases we continued to implement price increases and fuel based surcharges to recover escalating energy costs. In Tonnage Gases we expect higher operating performance bonuses and lower maintenance spending in quarter four. In electronics and performance materials we anticipate higher electronics, specially materials volumes and lower cost, partially due to our product line rationalization efforts. And finally we expect to book Q4 effective tax rate of approximately 24% as a result of continuing benefits from our tax planning strategies. Slightly offsetting these sequential improvements is our forecast for lower equity affiliates income due to one time favorable adjustments in this quarter. On the economic front globally the outlook is turning more pessimistic over the past three months. The credit crisis continues to spread, consumer confidences drop, and inflation concerns are rising with higher energy and commodity prices. Fortunately growth in manufacturing exports continues in the U.S. and I am generally pleased with our volume growth and new business signings broadly. While there is continued economic uncertainty and speculation, we still see strength and growth in our markets both near term and long-term. Turning to slide 14. We are currently developing our plans for the next three years and we are excited by the opportunities we see going forward. As Nelson said in his business commentary, we continue to see strong bid activity in Tonnage Gases as both hydrogen for refining and oxygen for gasification, continued to grow. To get an accurate look at our capital spending, you do have to make one adjustment. A few years ago there was an accounting change that moved the one-on-one onsite to capital lease treatment. Previously this was shown in property plant and equipment capital spending. You can see this as use of cash under our operating cash flows in the line item non-current capital lease receivables. Therefore you need to add this to our property plant and equipment capital line. When you do, you see our capital spending is about $1.4 billion for 2008. About 40% of this is for long term onsite and pipeline contracts. In fiscal 2007 the equivalent spending was $1.1 billion and 40% was for onsite contracts. Looking forward to fiscal 2009, we expect that capital spending under the same method will rise to $1.7 billion to $2 billion level and approximately 50% of this will be in the onsite area. As a rule of thumb you can translate the amount of sales produced by each dollar of capital in the onsite merchant areas by 70%. What this says is that the same demand factors we have discussed with you in the past year are delivering significant growth opportunities as we expected. These factors are higher energy prices and demand, higher capital cost, and stricter environmental rates. While this results in more of our business moving to long-term take or pay contracts we are using our cyclicality and providing greater consistency in our cash flows. Turning to slide 15, while we are not done with our 2009 forecast, I can share with you what we are seeing? For our Merchant, Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Material segments we expect to see underlying sales growth from volume and price of about 6% to 7%. This excludes any changes due to currency or energy and raw material pass through. This is slightly below our longer term forecast due to the current manufacturing environment we are seeing around the world. In 2009 we would expect our equipment and energy segment to be about even with 2008 as the impact of new orders offsets the projects completed this year. Our top priority continues to be to improve our returns by making progress towards our 17% margin goal for 2010. Our efforts are focused on achieving productivity through the full year benefit of the product line rationalization efforts in Electronics and the elimination of the restructuring cost we have carried in this area. Continued transactional cost reduction by using share services NFAP globally, continued benefits from making the right decisions on how to source products, run our plans and price our products driven by the business information we get from SAP. And in higher energy price world, many improvements that we've identified in the past now look even more promising. We're taking action and turning them into cost saving. We will have more specific guidance at the year-end call in October. Right now, 2009 is shaping up to be another solid year of earnings growth driven by both volume and productivity gains. Growth in 2010 and 2011 also looks strong. As we have said before, we have good visibility into our business because of the long-term contract in the nature of much of the business. For those years we are seeing even stronger growth as the impact of increasing capital spending comes on stream and starts generating revenues and profits. Finally, you can see the changes we've made over the past few years are delivering consistent strong growth in revenue, income, and returns. We remain committed as a team to continue taking advantage of the excellent market opportunities we have to continue this growth and deliver increased shareholder value. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Amy to take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. Paul on the --
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: n the CapEx outlook. What are the returns on capital metrics of the backlog right now?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If you have the return on capital it is above... and the returns which we have experienced in our existing business, we're probably seeing our returns going up overtime. It's hard to give an average because it's a mix of risk there Dave. And we are looking at the projects individually. But I can assure you that we are exceeding our return on capital from a cash flow standpoint by very good margin.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And any reason why the CapEx would be down in 2010 given the strength of the backlog?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. I'm very specific about that I think as we look at 2009 we look at CapEx growing and given the biding activity which we have today and the projects which we are working on. We would expect our CapEx to grow in the 2010 and 2011, primarily driven by onsite contracts hydrogen and gasification.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And what's the only onside projects, the ones you aggressively bid for, what's your win rate?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's hard to actually get a win rate because these are large, are large deals but I think we feel very good about our win rate on here. I don't really keep track of a batting average per say in that area for us. A lot of the jobs, which we are getting now Dave and we really aren't bidding, a lot of them sit on our pipeline systems or sit with existing customers who we have build our relationship with. And so it's a deal for us which they aren't going out and getting some of the bids on.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Hi, good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Jeff.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Couple of things, the equity income went from I think $35.5 million last year to $46.5 million, so it's up 30%. And you're operating profits I think were up 8%, so what's the difference, what's going on in equity income that's so strong?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The first thing in which we said Jeff is, about half of that gain is due to some adjustments for converting to GAAP in our Asian affiliates, U.S. GAAP, as they made adjustments. Over a period of time, we have consolidated that now, and taken a look at those things. If you then look at the other things you have to look at the underlying economies in which these are. Next you can affiliate is getting very strong growth in volumes, principally due to a lot of things on oil recovery. We continue to grow in India; we continue to grow in Italy. So it's the underlying growth in those areas.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan: So I take it that's about $0.03 a share benefit.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The benefit from equity affiliates in term.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Yes.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan: And secondly can you just remind me like what your output in standard cubic feet is in hydrogen and when you look at the new business you bringing on for '09, how much does that grow and for 2010 when you are just talking about new capacity you are bringing on?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: When you look at the new capacity which we are bringing on in '09 in hydrogen, in '09 it is not substantial for us as we look at that right now. We have most of the new capacity which we have won in hydrogen comes on stream in 2010, 2011 for us, alright. And if you look at the annual sales of the onsite business it is about at the run rate today and the current hydrogen price is up $4 billion, about 75% or so of that 80% of that is hydrogen for us.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan: Okay, thank you very much.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning P.J.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: You know, you guys did a big U turn in healthcare. If you are trying to make earnings less cyclical and increase return on capital then by same logic why wouldn't you sell your equipment business?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If you take a look at the equipment business P.J. it is something which we have which actually supports the onsite business. We have been through this probably a lot of times with people, is that it leads to orders in the future for us. So a lot of the work which we have done in the equipment business to sell large air separations plans has actually led us to have the right solutions in the gasification end of projects which we are doing very well. We have number of projects in China, which we are working on our backlog right now, and so that does support. The other thing is the O&G business, it helps us acquire presence in the Middle East as does the oxygen plant sale business which we have there. So lot of there is really is support business in the onsite area and has performed very well for us, so its part of that business. It doesn't really put a lot of cyclicality into it. It doesn't take a lot of capital for it. It is not something which I would like to sell to somebody and put somebody else into the business of this.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Well I understand the ASU business but L&G energy business is cyclical?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The L&G business is, absolutely. It does go up and down. It doesn't require a lot of investment for us. We think... we actually think that Air Products is the high value honor for this business we think...
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Okay...
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We think the skills which we have build up and we don't think we could get the same value off of somebody else.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Right, I am not saying you should sell it; I just wanted to understand your logic.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay, that's fine.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: The second question I have is on operating margins and your operating margin goals.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Are you focusing on the right things, because with this natural gas raw material pass through the operating margins are becoming quite volatile and it's very difficult to track them against the goals.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And P.J. and you are right, if you take a look at the onsite business and the Tonnage Gas business as you saw this quarter and the margins were taken down by that. However, if you look at the Electronics business, the Performance Materials business, the Merchant gas business, all of those are businesses in which we have established targets for margins. And so we have an overall target, but I think more importantly we have targets for each of those areas. And as to get to the Electronics and Performance Materials business above 15 to get the Merchant gas business above 17, if the pass through prove and presents some improvement on the Tonnage side as long as I am looking and getting a good return I going to be happy with that business. So I think we are focused right but I know we are focused right on this year, on the right metrics for how we are measuring and going after this business.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: And just I have a follow up question, just a quick question on the --
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: P.J, I just got to correct. I made a mistake. I said the Merchant Gas business was negative above 20%. I think I said 17% that was error on my part. Okay.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Okay. And in your answer to Jeff Zekauskas questions about this equity income, you said there was a conversion of some of this equity income to U.S. GAAP, does that means it was not reported under U.S. GAAP before, was there cash benefit?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It was reported under GAAP before but what happens here is that the conversion were done in the country and we took the work back here and we looked and made adjustments as to how they did the conversions. And the conversions were wrong.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: And was there a catch up benefit in the quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, there was... and that was due... and that was about half of the increase.
P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Okay. Thank you.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Hi, good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Mike.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: It's my understanding that one of your competitors recently raised pricing in Europe. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact that you have seen, as a result of that on the pricing environment in Europe?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, in the pricing environment in Europe is getting better, as we've talked about that. We're out there trying to get our prices up in that area. You can see in this quarter and I think in slide seven that our prices were up 3% quarter three way over '07.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: And then was wondering if you could give us an update on the Eastman gasification project? Is construction there still plan to begin in early '09, or if there have been any changes there?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: On the project, I think you are best to talk Eastman and there the person who is actually trying and we are both, the customer of the project and a supplier. We are excited to be in it, we see as a great opportunity for us but I don't want a comment on my customer's project for you.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Okay. And then in the Merchant business you were talking about the two fuel surcharges you put in place. Can you walk through, how those work. And as you see diesel prices rising, what assumptions had you been making about fuel cost and is the surcharge then something that is static or is it something that changes with changes in fuel costs?
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Hi, Mike. This is Nelson. I will comment on that. It is indexed to a basically published information on diesel fuel cost index. Both the Government and Air Products do forecast going forward. Clearly the run up that we saw in the last quarter that we talked about the 30% jump. We talked about in May and June and you could really see it happen over about of four to six week period. Clearly it got out in front of us from that standpoint. We were pretty comfortable with what we had out there in May versus forecast. What we have done with the July action, is increased the amount required to not only catch up but also get ahead of whatever forecast is out there. And then the surcharge will basically adjust if diesel prices fall down and we typically use the three quarter rolling average. Why we like this mechanism, is that our contracts allow us to surcharge and so this is something that we can implement very rapidly and get that in place pretty quickly so we can have a fairly quick impact on the P&L.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Good morning.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Hi Laurence.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: I guess first of all, on the tonnage, what was the incremental margin on the flat sales or how much of the delta we think about in Q4 versus Q3?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The margin on the spot sales, if you look at that really depends upon what the price was for gas there, but I think you can look at spot sales margins incrementally and not being questioned for the overhead activities of somewhere in the 20% range or so.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Okay. And do you have a rough sense for... you have done a good job on taxes this year, do you have a rough sense for whether the tax rate is sustainable next year or should we expect it to creep higher?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right now I would expect it to be up a percent or two over the 25% which I'm going to book over all in this year. But that's something which we are currently taking a look at. It depends a lot of decisions on how we manage our cash and fund things but we obviously try to keep this as low as possible and pay as few taxes as we are required to.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: And then the nascretion [ph] on healthcare is $0.11 for this year, that's about $0.09 in first three quarters?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's about $0.08 in the first three quarters.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Okay and I guess just lastly on, this has been an unusual quarter, having pricing lagging energy cost. Is there anything, is there a mix issue embedded in that or are there particular end markets where you have had an issue?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. What happened was that the diesel cost went up a lot more than what we anticipated and we have taken the action to get the price increases out there, but that was simply the fact we didn't see and there wasn't anyone who saw the amount of increase in the diesel cost which occurred in May and June.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson with Merrill Lynch.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Paul a question on the Tonnage business, you talked about volume slow down due to lower refinery utilization rates, question there is, is that specific to some of your customers, I would have thought that those who were switching over to greater dist [ph] with production would have required even more hydrogen? And then I know you have three projects that you have signed, but haven't announced and you have got some potential in the oil sands. Again what would be the volume impact from these projects as they start up in 2010, 2011, what percentage of your existing business would they?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay, Don, if you take a look at the on the customers yes, it was specific to few of our customers in the Tonnage area for hydrogen and it was around how the refining was running, whether refining was up or down. We don't think there was anything long-term. Overall we think the dynamics here are for the refineries to acquire a lot more high vision in the future, to make more transportation fields, and to also process heavier and more solid crudes. If you take a look at the projects in which we have the... the three projects and the work which we're doing in oil sands. I think what we are looking at is sales growth its going to be lumpy obviously with the projects but if you look over a period of time something in 15% to 20% range for us is what we are predicting.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And Nelson a follow up on Merchants, you talked about some capacity additions in the U.S. you are still seeing volume growth. What are your operating rate trends there? And if you could also tell us what operating rates are doing in Europe?
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: U.S. operating rates are holding pretty steady. I mean, we're consuming this product that we're bringing on stream, if anything we probably saw a slight pick up quarter-to-quarter in utilization. Even with the capacity coming on stream. As we said before we were careful in where we place this product, these expansions and the demand has come in as expected. So that continues to work pretty well for us. In Europe, clearly UK is right from a loading perspective. As we made the comment in the commentary, we are happy to see some of our signings rates picking up and some new customer's that have come on stream specifically in the UK have helped us load those plans. Our volumes or capacity is pretty tight and remains tight on the continent. We are not seeing any slippage in utilization rates. And our Eastern Europe plans are still very tight as you were adding some capacity and pull in to address that. So it still remains pretty tight across the system which should continue to support our pricing efforts.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: And by tight community in the U.S. you are still sort of in the mid upper 80s?
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Yes, upper 80s.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Alright. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Gulley with Soleil - Gulley & Associates.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Hi, good morning guys.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hey, good morning, Mark.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: I want to talk a little bit by CapEx-to-sales. If I did the math it would appear as if for next year your CapEx-to-sales on an adjusted basis is going to be coming in the 15% area, well above the 10% where you have been running and the industry has been running for a while. And lot closer to the battle, 20% when I care to remember. So, is that 15% CapEx-to-sales number that's going to be, something sustained for a while? And are you concerned about a capacity searcher?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Mark, I do believe that and the number is going through sustained going out in the future. I'm not concerned about the capacity coming on stream because this CapEx is sold as we are bringing it on stream. It is in the Tonnage gas area, principally for hygiene and refining and oxygen for gasification are the two areas in which we look at. And so it is not like the old days where we... a lot of plant and equipment was going in the liquid plant area.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Okay, fair enough. The industry has been very successful in getting price increases and surcharges for sometime now. Are you starting to see any kind of push back at all and customer saying enough is enough that we really can't absorb these higher costs?
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Mark, Nelson, responding that, we have not seen the push back. What we have talked about in the previous calls is that our customers have been more successful in last two or three or four years of passing these increases on to their customers and that trend certainly is continuing. Again with our third surcharge of the year our customers understand why we're doing if they are seeing those prices themselves. And so we continue to be successful at getting those out there.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: And the final question is one of your competitors has announced another share repurchase program as they look at their balance sheet. I know, you haven't talked a lot about '09 but Paul, can you share with us whether not surplus free cash flow could be used to buy more stock for your products?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And the answer is yes. And I have been through the... and the way in which we use our cash and we still have about $840 million of authority from our board on that and we would use it in that way.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Thanks Paul.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Banc of America Securities.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc Of America Securities: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc Of America Securities: If I look at the equipments in Energy business, it looks like your backlog improved sequentially there, you have some new equipment orders, profit was down quite a bit in the quarter. If you look at that $4 million operating income number, had that compared to what you would envision as a cyclical trough level in that business, trying to gauge how close we might be to the cyclical bottom there?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think we are close to the bottom there.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc Of America Securities: Okay. So you would expect that business to remain in the black through the bottom?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc Of America Securities: Okay. Then to follow up on tonnage a little bit, you referenced slower spot sales. Could you advice, what percentage of sales in that business were spot and whether or not you are seeing customers that are offline completely because of operating problems or is it a situation where your are seeing folks throttle back due to poor spreads?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: With regards to the percentage of sales would you have. If you take a look at the pipeline systems which we operate somewhere in 10% and 15% of the systems are available for spot, in general. So that would be the way in which I would look at that. As far as the customers coming down, there were some turns which customers had and they were also decisions on the customers part to operate in and cut back. So we saw both of those things.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc Of America Securities: Okay. And finally can you give us an updated time line on your ASU starts at Reidsville and Ashland, I was expecting Reidsville to come up fairly soon here.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Reidsville is on stream. Ashland will be up very soon like within the next 30 days.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc Of America Securities: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from, Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Paul when take a look at that 15% goal that you had thought for the total company for operating margins, are you on track there for Merchant gasses and Electronic Performance Material this year?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we are. As far as the progress, yes.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, then when you think about electronics business, I thought I heard you say that it was growing 20% excluding equipment?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Is that run-rate sustainable? Can you give us little bit of idea where the winds or where the growth is coming from there?
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Certainly Mike, this is Nelson. Materials growth is very strong so that number was ex-equipment and ex-skew reduction effort, the 20%. Continuing to see good volume growth in products like NF3 and the other key products that we are selling. Our ACT product line continues to perform very well. That's all in the face of silicon that's growing probably a little lighter than last year probably in the 5% to 6% versus a full year 7%. So we are getting a multiple on the silicon growth as we expected. Our prospects as we see things flat panel is also done a bit better than expected this year. We expect that to basically continue. Silicon growth appears to be solid. So that looks like it will continue and the other part of this is we are bringing the new NF3 capacity on as we speak in Korea and we expect that to be largely loaded fairly quickly. And behind that is again some new low key products which are picking up momentum in sales. So, we think we're going to continue in a solid growth pattern there.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay and then, if you take a look at the European healthcare business, can you just sort of remind us why you are saying that business is a good business to keep? When you put it into Merchant, will it... the press margins, health margins, margins about the same?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It was going to help the margins in the Merchant area as it goes in and so you can see the map from the stuff which we have put out there. But overall Mike, this structure of the market is not the same as in the U.S. Bulk of the business, which we have in Europe is bid and you get it... and you get the business and you're able to serve it. Then that's not the same thing as what occurs here in the market here.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. And one last quick question. You seem to be little more pessimistic in the overall global economy. Can you just give us a little bit... at least a little more pessimist then what you thought in April and May, can you just give us an idea of maybe regionally or are there any certain end markets there that are causing you to be little bit of watchful in terms of the economy?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It is not so much driven by the end market, it is more driven by the factors, that we continue to see the bank saving trouble. So we continue to see that happen. We see a drop in consumer confidence which has to have, which is going to... its going to... it has to reflect itself back. We actually think that consumer confidence is too low for how the economy is actually working. And then probably the bad news which comes over on the news on TV every night, weighs upon people and they hear it too much. But there are a lot of good things in the economy too. If you look at the underlying the strength of especially in the U.S. of exports has really bowled manufacture economy here. So it's a balanced look on those things. Overall we think the manufacturing sector is actually performing the best of anybody. So, in our area we are feeling pretty good.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thank you guys.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shaw with UBS.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Hey, good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Chris.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Hi Chris.
Chris Shaw - UBS: To beat those spot sales versus the data. From the way you described it the reduction in spot sales reflection of refinery usage rates as well, utilization [ph] rates?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Chris Shaw - UBS: And then most everything has been covered. But was the accretion from the impact of investing in U.S. Healthcare for the quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: $0.03, it will be when you look at it.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay. That's all I got. Thanks.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Okay. Chris.
Operator: Thank you, your next question comes from Marybeth Connolly with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Actually it's Bob Koort. Good morning guys.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Bob.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Just a quick question on, healthcare and I am sure you will be glad to start talking about it soon, but why the magnitude to write off and then why sell it piece meals [ph] trying to package it, so I thought at least the strategy when you guys owned it was doing critical math to provide some synergy?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. As far as the size of the charge it is based upon an impairment analysis of trying to take a look at the cash flows of the business Bob and that's what it comes out to be. And so our view of the business, based upon the things which we are seeing today and what's happened in the marketplace is a lot worse than it was a year ago and that's why the size of the charge. As far as trying to grab and sell things in pieces we are not. We are actually trying to... we are growing to market with the thing is a whole. The New York and New Jersey Properties came as an opportunity for us, in that business actually. It was in very bad place for us as far as from a cash standpoint. And we had an opportunity from a local guy who wanted that business and we chose the sell it.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov with Lehman Brothers.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Good morning.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Hi Sergey.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Sergey.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Paul can you help us understand how much of the factor was the escalation of the construction course. And by that I mean total construction course, labor, materials, etc. If you said number may be from 75 to 78 or maybe you have even annual numbers?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Construction cost on capital spending?
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Correct.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If we take a look at that and go from lets say 2003 to 2004 before commodity prices starting to run up, it depends upon the area the country. But we could see capital cost being up anywhere from 25% to 50%.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And so, when you sign your new contract formalities, do you try to achieve a certain profit for Tonnage of output or you've taken into account higher current construction costs and that becomes your base factor.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We price based upon the cost of the capital there. So what we're doing is recovering on the cost of capital there. So it is not based upon the output, its based upon the cost which we are going to have to invest there.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Okay and lastly on the topic. When you think about your move from $1.4 billion in '08, so lets say $1.8 billion in '09 how much of this increase is due to high construction cost?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: From '08 to '09 it's not a lot probably.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: So you must have --
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And maybe 5 to 10.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: So it is mostly volume driven.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: A lot of the inflation on the construction has already occurred. The other thing Sergey and we are taking a different look as far as on the rest of these projects. We are trying to pass a lot more of that risk on to our customers here.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Yes, good morning, just two questions.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Hi John
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: In the Merchant CapEx that you are going to be spending, can you give us a rough idea of regionally where that CapEx is going to be spent for the Merchant capacity coming on in '09?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay, the bulk of that is being spent in Asia. It has to do with capacity for Electronics and Performance Materials which a lot of that is in Asia and that lot of expansions on the liquid products is Asia also and the bulk of that.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay that's helpful and then in the material or the performance materials business with volumes up 5%, can you give us some help in understanding where that's actually coming from, I thought this business was mostly inks and codings related which certainly wouldn't be an up 5% type number?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The bulk of this is Asia and is driven by good demand in the epoxy area, which goes around the infrastructure improvements being made in Asia.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Nelson Squires - Investor Relations: Sure.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with HSBC.
Hassan Ahmed - HSBC: Good morning guys.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Hassan.
Hassan Ahmed - HSBC: Clearly a fair bit of chemical and general process industry activity in the Middle East, so could you guys just give me your view of the lay of the land out there, essentially in terms of future gases growth, and maybe also elaborate on essentially a product strategy to win incremental business in the region.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, and that... the Middle East is a market which Air Products has worked in for a while. We actually have two plants which will be coming on later in the year which are sale of gas JV's in that area. What is far as from other in the market for gases in that area has been principally been sale of equipment. We are trying to convert that to a sale gas market for oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. We are working very hard at and we think we are going to make and be a success in that area. And we are excited about that opportunity.
Hassan Ahmed - HSBC: So you think the prudent strategy is that a sale of equipment leads to sale of gases there?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Hassan Ahmed - HSBC: And there will be a move towards let's say outsourcing on the part of the Middle Eastern companies, outsourcing in terms of gasses?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Hassan Ahmed - HSBC: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you and our final question will come from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: Hi good morning, Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Ed.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: Just on NF3, what was the growth in volumes and pricing this quarter and also in the prior quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If we look at that on the NF3, I have to check here, hold on for a second, I will pull a number here as far as NF3, I don't have the individual product volumes brought in front of me. But if we look at that the pricing and volume basically were an offset over the whole speck materials area. We are up versus about 17% in volume in that area in the quarter over the prior year right now, I just got the number.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: And in the second quarter, it was faster or slower?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's about flat with Q2.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: And on Merchant in Europe, again the improvement in volumes there was that driven by England, Spain or Germany?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It was driven by probably the UK because that's the area in which we have the capacity of sale, in the other countries I am sold out.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: Thank you and at this time, I would like to turn it back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.

Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Thank you, Jimmy. Good morning, and welcome to Air Products' quarterly earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today, our CFO, Paul Huck, and I will review our second quarter results. We issued our earnings release this morning and it is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of the call beginning at 2 P.M. Eastern Time are also available on the website.

Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Nelson. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Now please turn to slide number three for a review of this quarter's results from continuing operations. As you can see, we had another good quarter and as we reached the mid point of our fiscal year we continue to make solid progress on a number of our fiscal year 2008 financial targets. For the quarter, sales grew 13% versus prior year. Growth was limited by softness in several of our equipment product offerings mainly due to customer concerns around higher capital cost and less new investment in general. Excluding equipment, sales grew 15% driven primarily by better volumes in our Electronic and Performance Materials and Tonnage segments and higher pricing in Merchant Gases. Currency contributed 4%, higher natural gas pass-through and acquisitions each contributed 2% for an underlying equivalent growth rate of 7%. We continue to make progress reducing SG&A as a percentage of sales. This quarter, SG&A was 12% of sales, an improvement from prior year. Operating income of $365 million was up 18% from prior year again due to better volumes in pricing and also favorable currency. As a result, our operating margins improved 60 basis points to 14%. Margins were down a 100 basis points sequentially related to a number of factors in each segment. Higher natural gas cost and bidding expenses impacted tonnage. SAP implementation in Central and Eastern Europe impacted Merchant. Equipment sales more than doubled quarter-on-quarter in Electronics. And finally Healthcare margins declined due to ongoing issues in the U.S. business. With the volume and pricing gains we are forecasting for the second half of the year, we are on track to achieve our operating margin goal of 15% for the year. For the quarter, our net income and diluted earnings per share increased by 24% and 27% respectively. Our return on capital improved with return on capital employed… increasing to 12.4%, up 70 basis points from last year. Now please turn to slide number four. Now, let me talk about the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our GAAP or as reported EPS increased 40%. This reflects $0.28 from discontinued operations, which includes the gain on the sale of our Polymer Emulsions business. And we also had a pension settlement charge of $0.08 per share. Excluding the discontinued operations and the pension settlement charge, EPS from continuing operations grew 27%. Higher volumes added $0.08. Higher pricing and margins together contributed $0.01. Our Poland acquisition improved earnings $0.02, favorable currency added $0.07. Higher equity affiliate income contributed $0.05 as we continue to see good growth in operating performance in a number of countries. $0.02 of this is attributable to the reimbursement of an anti-trust fine in our Italian affiliate. We repurchased 4 million shares spending $365 million this quarter. Fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.02. A slightly lower tax rate was pretty much offset by higher interest expense. All other items net contributed $0.01. The bottom line is that we had a very solid second quarter and our fiscal year 2008 is off to a good start. We continue to deliver leverage to the bottom line. At mid year, sales growth is 11% and our EPS growth is 22%. Now I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Thanks, Paul. Please turn to slide five, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases continued to grow at a solid pace during the quarter. Sales of $902 million were up 15% versus prior year. Currency contributed 7% and acquisitions contributed 5%. Pricing added 4% and volume was down 1%. Lower equipment sales reduced volumes by 4% in the quarter. Merchant Gases operating income of $167 million was up 18% versus prior year and segment operating margin of 18.5% was up 50 basis points, mainly due to pricing gains. Margins were down sequentially by 110 basis points due to higher cost to support growth including our SAP implementation in Central and Eastern Europe. Let me now provide a few highlights by region. Please turn to slide six. In North America, our sales increased 8%, driven by strong pricing gains. Overall growth was limited by the availability of argon and helium and less spot liquid hydrogen sales versus a year ago. We will implement an additional fuel surcharge in North America on the first of May to recover the cost increases incurred since our previous surcharge implementation on 1, January. New business signings were strong in the quarter and are significantly ahead of target for both the quarter and year-to-date. We expect to see the impact of these signings in the second half of the year. Sales increased 27% over prior year in Europe with price adding 3%, currency 14%, acquisitions 12%, and volumes down 2%. Business was generally soft in the UK and Spain during the quarter. Volumes were impacted by fewer spot sales versus a year ago. Availability of helium across the region and general tightness of supply of LOX/LIN on the continent. In Asia, Merchant sales were up 22% over last year, volumes contributed 15%, currency 4%, and price 3%. We saw less impact on volume for Lunar New Year than in previous years. Please turn to slide seven, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $867 million increased 25% compared to last year. Volumes increased 12% versus prior year reflecting growth from new plants in Asia and Europe and improved plant loading. Natural gas and raw material prices were higher versus prior year and added 8%, currency added 3%, and acquisitions 2%. Sequentially, volumes were up 4%. Operating income of $111 million was up 20% compared to last year. The increase over prior year was due to higher volumes and improved plant efficiencies. Operating income was flat sequentially. Operating margin of 12.8% was 50 basis points lower than last year held down by higher natural gas cost pass-through and higher project bidding expenses. This reduced margin sequentially as well. We brought our second hydrogen plant on stream, on schedule for Petro-Canada's refinery in Edmonton, Alberta in April. Bidding continues at a high level across the segment. We're making solid progress on the Tonnage projects discussed during the last call and expect to announce signed agreements during the current quarter. Please turn to slide eight, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $562 million were up 6% compared to last year. Volumes were up 5% accounting for the majority of the gain. Electronics sales were up 2% compared to last year driven by higher sales in specialty materials and Tonnage, offset by lower equipment sales and the SKU reduction effort. Excluding equipment and the SKU reduction effort, sales increased 10%. Electronics sales were up 7% sequentially due to higher equipment sales. In Performance Materials, overall volumes grew 3% versus prior year and 7% sequentially. Continued weakness in sales to the North America housing market was more than offset by strong sales to the commercial construction markets in Europe and the Middle East. Overall, operating income of $68 million was up 20% versus prior year. Operating margin of 12% was up 130 basis points versus prior year due to the impact of the Electronics restructuring and higher volumes in Performance Materials. Margins were down 80 basis points sequentially, mainly due to higher equipment sales. We expect to see continued progress in improving our margins over the second half of this year. Please turn to slide nine, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $105 million in this segment decreased due to lower LNG activity. On a sequential basis, sales increased 4%. Operating income of $10 million decreased versus prior year and increased slightly versus prior quarter. Our backlog of projects now totals $203 million. We did receive letters of intent for a few large air separation units in the quarter, which will be added to the backlog next quarter. We are also seeing the bidding activity pick up for LNG. We expect to receive additional LNG orders later this year. Please turn to slide ten, Healthcare. Healthcare segment sales of $170 million were up 8% compared to prior year, due primarily to currency. Sequentially sales were down 1% reflecting solid results in Europe and softness in the U.S. business. Operating income of $9 million was up 34% versus prior year on higher European results and currency. Overall margins were at 5.5%, improving 100 basis points versus prior year. Our margins declined 250 basis points sequentially due to continuing issues in the U.S. business. Paul will have more to say on the U.S. Healthcare business in his closing remarks. Now I will turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Nelson. Now if you turn to slide 11. As we look forward from quarter two to quarter three, we are forecasting our third quarter earnings per share on a continuing operations basis to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30. This excludes any further divestiture impacts and represents year-on-year growth of 12% to 16%. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. In Electronics, we expect higher specialty materials volumes on increased foundry operating rates and further benefits from our product rationalization efforts. In Performance Materials, we expect to see a continued seasonal rebound in volumes into quarter three. In Merchant Gases, we expect higher volumes as we continue to drive new applications. We also continue to implement price increases and fuel-based surcharges to recover escalating cost. In Tonnage Gases, we have new plans on stream and we anticipate lower maintenance spending in quarter three. And finally, we expect to continue to see favorable currency impacts next quarter. Slightly offsetting these sequential improvements is our forecast for lower operating results in our Equipment and Energy segment due to the higher energy development spending and maintenance outages. On the economic front, we continue to see about 2% industrial production growth for U.S. manufacturing this fiscal year. The continued declines in U.S. housing and the weakness in autos is being offset by growth in manufacturing exports. In Europe, growth continues on the northern continent, while both the U.K. and Spanish economies are essentially flat. Year-on-year, we still expect to see growth in Europe at around 2%. Asia growth is also on track with our forecast at around 6% to 7%. Overall that puts our forecast for world [ph] manufacturing at around 3%, this compares to last year's growth of about 4%. While there is continued economic uncertainty and speculation, we still see strength and growth in our markets both near term and long term. Given our strong first half performance, our growing backlog of new investments and improved margins from our pricing and productivity efforts, we are raising our guidance by $0.10 on the bottom and $0.05 on the top to $4.95 to $5.05. Based upon fiscal 2007 EPS from continuing operations of $4.20, which excludes $0.30 of one-time net gains, we are forecasting a year-on-year increase of 18% to 20%. As Nelson mentioned in his business commentary, longer term, we are seeing strong bid activity across our businesses, which gives us confidence for continued growth in 2009 and beyond. Our property, plant and equipment capital spending guidance for fiscal 2008 remains unchanged at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Before we take your questions, let me update you on a few items. First, we closed the Polymer Emulsions sale on January 31st. And we are on schedule towards completing the sale of the two remaining plants. We have received bids and are currently in negotiations. Second, as you’ve likely read in our earnings release today, we are behind on our plan to improve our U.S. Healthcare business. And while we continue to execute our improvement plan, we are also evaluating all of our strategic alternatives for our U.S. business. We expect to complete this process during the third fiscal quarter and we'll update you then. Finally, in spite of slower economic growth we increased our earning guidance again this quarter. Demand factors such as higher energy prices, high capital cost and circular environmental rates are creating greater opportunities for many of our product offerings. Our global businesses are well positioned to continue capturing our share of these opportunities and our people are focused on continuing to deliver double-digit sales and earnings growth, improve margins, and higher returns in the future. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to Jimmy to take your questions. Question and Answer
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Yes, hi, good morning, Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, P.J.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Margins were down in Tonnage and you talked about higher project bidding expenses, what a change... is it just number of projects or are you constrained by personnel?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Constrained by what?
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Are you constrained by personnel? Yes.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, it's probably... as we've mentioned before P.J., there are a number of projects which with people are starting to move forward on. And so that has increased... it’s been increased our order intake, but it’s also increased our expenses right now because as you go through the bidding expenses you put them into the P&L. So, we are working on a really a record number of projects right now. Our personnel are tight, but we still feel good about our ability to win these projects and to execute them.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Okay. So, it's really the number of projects that you are working on.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's the number of projects, yes, it's at all-time high as far as the amount of capital and the numbers there, P. J.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Great. Well, that's a good news.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That is good news.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: And once you are finished with divesting remaining chemical businesses, are you done with your portfolio, are you happy with it, or do you see more divestitures or acquisitions? Where do you see your portfolio?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. As far as the portfolio is concerned, I think managing our portfolio is really something, which is going to be an active thing for us at all times. As we've said there aren't any sacred cows in our businesses. Our businesses have to perform as we go through here. And that's going to be the demand, which we make up on. I mean, it is something, which our investors, I think, should expect of the management team here.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: And just lastly, you mentioned that Europe was down 2% and sort of weak U.K., Spain, is it a bigger read through for European economy in this common share?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, I actually said... as far as we look at the European economy, we think it's going to be up 2%, in the view of things, as we said that. Certainly, the U.K. has been weak for a long period of time. And if you look at economic growth as far as on the manufacturing side, it goes up and goes down a little bit. But for the past five or six years, I think the... if I show you the graph, you would say flat and that's what essentially we're looking at right now. As far as Spain is concerned, Spain has suffered some of the same problems from the housing bubble that and that the U.S. has suffered. Plus, we're also seeing some of the impacts of the Europe over there because some of the manufacturing is coming here for things [ph].
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll hear next from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Dave.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Paul, margins were down sequentially in Merchant Gas, you mentioned some higher cost of support growth, can you detail those costs? Will they continue going forward?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, as far as the Merchant, the thing which we mentioned was that our SAP cost, because we are bringing Poland and Europe live... and the Eastern Europe countries live on SAP, we have some extra cost which always occur in the months going up to that go-live. So, we do expect the margins to come back and rebound in Merchant. For the year, we're still looking to make our gain to a 19% margin or so.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: And Paul, just on Electronics, you mentioned 10% growth, ex the SKU reduction and equipment. What's driving that growth, is it LCDs and what's the potential for margin in this segment going forward?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: First answer, the potential for margin as we mentioned, our goal is to get the Electronics and Performance Materials margins to 15% or above. And so we are making good steady progress towards that. Now if you take a look at what's driving the growth, it is all of the product lines as we look at this, it's the chips and it's also LCD and solar is starting to make some inroads although albeit it is very small, but we are seeing a lot of bid activity around on the solar end right now. In the market for solar, Dave, would be very similar to the market for LCDs as far as products are concerned.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go and take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Hi, good morning.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: You mentioned that there was $0.02 share refund, I think, a fine in one of your equity income ventures. So is that $4 million or $6 million, I don't know how they treat the tax effects of that in equity income?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It… for that one, it is $6 million.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: It's $6 million.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's $6 million.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Something like $36 million.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: So your equity income is really advancing very nicely or at least this quarter it is, I mean order of magnitude, I guess it's up about 18%, though in the first quarter it was down, but maybe it was penalized by fines?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, and… the fine actually occurred in, I think, it was Q3 '06 for us and we disclosed that at that time. And the things which have helped us as far as the equity affiliate income, and it does bounce around as a lot of things because it is contained within ventures, is that our larger affiliates are Italian affiliate and our met… our Mexican affiliate [inaudible]. We also brought the… our plan for to serving PEMEX online in the first... towards the end of the first quarter of this year. And so we got the full effect in this quarter, so that was a nice gain for us. India is also in there. That's another one that's growing very nicely for us. So we have a lot of good countries covered from growth. It's something which I feel is not... as people don't have and don't understand as well, and don't appreciate as well. It's a good source of earnings and cash for us.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: In the Electronics area, I mean you've obviously made wonderful progress in your margins year-over-year, but when you look at your Electronics business sequentially, your revenues are up about $50 million and operating profits are flat. Why is that?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: When Nelson went through the Electronics area, one of the things he mentioned is that the equipment sales were up. Equipment sales do not carry the same amount of profit with them. And equipment sales are bumpy in this business. They are not smooth. So we had very low equipment sales in the first quarter. We had twice as much equipment sales in the second quarter. So that did produce some of the shifts there. I think the other thing, which happens, Jeff, is that we have seen a pattern as far as on the Electronics business of seeing that the second quarter is slow and that gets down to… a lot of Electronics goes into the consumer. And so there are a lot of things which go around Christmas, so you see as your… the pick-up here is in the late spring as they start manufacturing and say, you see pickup back in our Q3, a strong Q4, a strong Q1 and then a little bit of a slowdown on a sequential basis in our Q2. That is something, which we have observed for the past few years. We wouldn't probably expect that to change, but the business still has very good strong growth fundamentals around it and continues to grow strongly. A good indicator for us is we followed very closely from the industry standpoint are the foundry operating rates, TSMC, UMC.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Yes, lastly you are exploring strategic options for your Healthcare business. Why are you doing that and is the idea to divest it on favorable terms or to grow it through joint venture? What's your bias?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as far as Healthcare business and what we're talking about is not the business in Europe. The business in Europe is operating extremely well to U.S. The U.S., as we have talked to people before, it is not the same as the business in Europe, a different market for Healthcare. Healthcare is delivering in a different way and prices are set in a different way in the U.S. The first quarter we are actually a little bit behind plan although we had made some progress and are more encouraged by that, but we are even falling further behind in this quarter though our plan was based up on making volume gains and taking and doing simplification efforts on our products and saving some money. We are on track on the saving money case. We are not on track as far as the volume is concerned. And so our concern around this business goes to the volume and so we decided that it has been a drag on this company as far as earnings are concerned and we are not happy with that. And so we're going to look at other alternatives, which we have. So it includes everything, which you would think of, Jeff, of a company trying to take a good, hard, long look at your business and doing the right thing for the investors.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Sergey Vasnetsov with Lehman Brothers.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Sergey.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi, Sergey.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. I want to ask you a couple of question from corporate lines. Your interest came down this quarter, hence the tax rate also quite a bit lower than what we expected. Is it in your run rate or it's just one-time blip on the downside?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As far as the tax rate is concerned, the answer to that is yes, and those things are going to move, and the tax rate is going to go up and down. Our tax rate guidance for the year is probably still good, which we had probably closer to the low end of the 27 to 28 for us as we look into the future. But it does depend upon planning actions, which we take. And so we booked them at a time, in which those actions are certain and we view we're going to be able to take them. So it does produce... it's not going to be steady at all times, it's my message. As far as the interest expense is concerned, we continue to pay a lot of attention to managing cash properly. But as you can see we are also paying a lot of attention to making sure we go out and buy back shares. Our capital spending, it does produce... we do take and capitalize a portion of our interest as well. But if you look at that you can model those things in your model… pretty good.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And so, as far as the share buyback, should we can expect it to continue at the run rate it had recently at around $250 million a year... a quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes… actually, if you look at the… at what we did, the share buyback, of course, this year, for us in this quarter was higher than that. First quarter was like $189 million; this quarter it was $355 million... $365 million. And so total we're at $554 to date. We did take advantage of the drop in the market when it occurred. We had a program out there, which enabled us to do that, 10b5-1 program. We have now completed the $1.5 billion of share buyback over the... from the mid '06 buyback, we're about $100 million into our… the $1 billion, which we announced in September. So that kind of gives you the update on the stats there. The other thing is, as far as the share buyback going forward, it depends upon the capital and the cash, which we generate. I would expect that over the next two quarters that we would be back in the market buying shares, yes.
Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go and take our next question from Don Carson with Merrill Lynch.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Paul, question to follow-up on Electronics. What's your latest view on square inches of silicon process? And you talked about foundry operating rates, I know, and then as you get into... in the current quarter now with creating of three plants about to go commercial? Is that one of the reasons why you are more optimistic on the specialty materials front?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Certainly, Don, with on our expansion on [inaudible] it gives us more products to sell and helps us with our sales growth there. But as far as on the square inches, we're looking about 6% right now.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay. So no real change there, I think you… target that for sometime?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's down a little, I think we said $7 million, but it's about the same.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then on the Tonnage business, is your mix changing there, I know that you start up a few new [inaudible] plants in Europe and Asia, which I would think would improve margins of that business. So, has there been any change in sort of the mix between atmospheric and hydrogen, which will have a margin impact?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There have not been any large changes in the mix when you look at, it is a large business, about two thirds of our sales, 70% of our sales or so are hydrogen still.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just in terms of the quarter, I know that a lot of refineries were running at reduced operating rates due to lower crack spreads, did that have a material impact on your business especially when you combined with the higher maintenance expense or do you just take that opportunity to take more maintenance and get that behind you?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And we actually took and we took the opportunity.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: All right, okay. Thank you.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yep.
Operator: Mike Harrison with First Analysis has our next question.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Corp.: Hi, good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Mike.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi, Mike.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Corp.: I was curious as you look at the growth potential in the geography like the Middle East, look at refineries as well as petrochemical plants, my understanding is that there it's mostly design and engineering business rather than Tonnage or Merchant type business. Can you talk about how you're positioned in the Middle East relative to your competitors and maybe what your expectations are for capturing some of that design and engineering business?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Mike. Historically, it has been for us to sell... and to sell equipment into there and we have done that. We have had a number of plants, which we sold both on the LNG side and the air separation side. However, in the first quarter, we did announce two plants, which went on a sale of gas onsite basis. So we're doing a conversion of that, one was in Oman, the other was in the UAE. So we have had success there in doing some of the conversions, but that's a challenge in the business going forward here, if something which were... in which we were spending a lot of people's time on trying to make that happen because we view that there is a value proposition to be offered to the customer here and a lot of growth for us for the things which we do best.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Corp.: Okay. And then with regard to the helium joint venture with Matheson Tri-Gas, given that current tightness that you're seeing in the helium market, curious how that new plant is progressing and whether you have any plans to accelerate possibly when that plant is coming on stream.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And the plant is progressing well in the schedule, which we put it on what was about as aggressive as one could get on that one originally.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Corp.: Okay. And then also I was hoping maybe you can give us an update on the Equipment and Energy segment, maybe what you really expect earnings to come up by the end of the year.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, if you look at that, the Equipment and Energy segment, we actually said about $0.15 to $0.20 a share down year-on-year was going to be the impact. I think that is still a good forecast for us. We are expecting orders to come in, in this year still. We’ve gotten some, on the air separation side, as Nelson talked about, we have some air separation orders which have come in and so we'll be announcing them shortly and we'll also be starting to execute them and put them in our backlog and starting to book sales on them. So that's good news. And then we also would expect some LNG orders in the last half of this year, probably towards the... probably more in the fourth quarter than in the third though.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Corp.: All right. And then last question I had on the Electronics segment, you reported 11% growth in January and then your next sales update had 8% growth and now for the full quarter you came in at 6%. Just wondering if you could explain maybe why the growth there appears to be slowing during the quarter. Is that just a function of the additional equipment sales or how should I think about that?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, and one thing... the equipment is lumpy as we talked about, but the other thing which people have to remember is we have the SKU reductions in Electronics, and so, and those are occurring here. However, as you can see they’re actually improving margins in that business year-on-year also. So and the sales... and the growth rate is held down but the growth and profit is a lot more and therefore the margins continue to get a lot better in that businesses.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis Corp.: All right, thanks very much.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Laurence.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: I guess just a couple of questions, first on specialty gas pricing and I think it pertains mostly to Electronics but also to the Merchant business. Can you discuss pricing trends in particular liquid gases where you are seeing more scarcity, you’re not just argon but also xenon, neon, and so on?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Yes, Laurence this is Nelson. We are clearly getting price in the products that are tight xylene, xenon, argon, helium and we are seeing very good price moment in those products. In general, pricing pressure is probably, it's still there, it's probably less than it was a year ago. We are managing our supplies of NF3 reasonably well, bringing the capacity on very carefully, so I think from a trend standpoint, we are happy with where price is overall.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: And so, if you were trying to aggregate that buckets including the Gases and the Merchant side, if there are any as well as in the Electronics, how larger buckets would that be as a percentage of sales?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Help me on the question again, Laurence.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: I guess, I’m trying to think, if you have sort of a more favorable supply demand dynamic on the more niche specialty gases, so that—
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Helium, xenon, neon, xylene, put them all as a bucket, how large is that?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would say that that roughly is probably 15% to 20%.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, perfect. I guess, second question is in Performance Materials, can you help us to quantify the percentage of the Performance Materials business that goes into commercial construction?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: On the commercial construction side in the U.S., it's about a third of the segment is Performance Materials and about a third of that is U.S. and roughly about a third. So it's little over 10% of that segment in total.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Okay. Perfect. And I guess lastly with the Equipment business, just to follow-up on the question about the sale of equipment in the Middle East, are you seeing certain improvements in your margins on the sale of ASUs?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: As you move towards larger projects and can you quantify that over time?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And we're seeing that and that has been, I think, as we have seen, demand pick-up for this thing... supply and demand is going to help, as the dynamics of that get better, our mark-ups are getting a lot better in that business also for us. It is not to the stage of the LNG mark-ups but then we don't have the same amount on the value added component.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: So, even if LNG were not to sort of recover, I mean you would still see over time a margin improvement in the segment?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we would.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mike Judd with Greenwich.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Yes, good morning. Thanks for your comments about the equity affiliate income about how it can be kind of lumpy. I was wondering, if you are looking at the June quarter, do you think it will be up or down from the March quarter, and again I think you talked a little bit about some of the European equity affiliate income. Does that imply that maybe in the September quarter it would be lower than June or just anything you can help us because it is lumpy. I mean maybe the other way of doing it is just to take an average of the December and March quarters but any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, I think, I think as we look forward on that we think that the... and that will probably close to flat on the equity affiliate income going from the second to the third quarter.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: And then it should be probably seasonally weaker in the September quarter.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It could be a little weaker. And because of the slowdown in the summer in Europe which has big... Italy is the big portion of that.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Thanks a lot for the time.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: Next we'll hear from Peter Butler with Glen Hill.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Good morning, Peter.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill: Hi. There is currently a pretty large gap in the value of oil versus gas, but it looks like that could close pretty quickly and so I am wondering how many potential LNG projects are you talking about and what's been the impact on these negotiations on your new technology?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There are currently more than 12 projects, which we are currently in stages of development on, as far as LNG is concerned. And that's an improvement from the prior year. If you look at the journals, there was actually an article on gas last week, I believe... I think it was Friday, which painted a very good picture for LNG in the future and when you look at that. So there is a lot of gas around the world and our… and as far as the Air Product... the Apex Technology, it actually gives us an advantage, it goes into the large field though. I mean, so you got to have the right field for it. But there are a lot of fields out there, which... and which qualify for us. So longer-term we believe LNG is going to be a very good business for us.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill: On the Healthcare, not to beat the dead horse, but I would bet that Mr. McGlade would knew that this thing was a goner before he even took over as CEO, and I'm wondering how long does it take to study the alternatives and if you said goodbye, what's the immediate impact on your earnings and your ROC?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, as far as this business is concerned, the alternatives are a lot here. We've got to study them, we've got to do the right thing for the investor. And that's why we are going to take a quarter to take a look at that. We had a plan and we made some progress against that plan in the first quarter and the progress has slowed in the second quarter and so, and we are not going to wait around. So I think... and John has made the decision to move forward and to look at all the things, which we can do to do that. The business... it loses money at the operating profit line for us now. And so that... and so it is a drag on earnings and it would improve if we were [inaudible], it does improve our return on capital, it does improve our margins, it will improve our earnings.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill: Is there any lesson to be learned in turn and lose your Lehigh engineers, trying to turn around the Healthcare business?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In any sort of situation, you can always learn, Peter.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill: Okay. Thanks for the help, guys.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: All right.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Banc of America Securities.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Yes, good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Paul, in the past you've expressed some interest in consolidating some of the, I guess, nearly $2 billion in unconsolidated sales that you have in your various joint ventures around the world on a 100% basis anyway. Now that you’re reviewing Healthcare, if you look out a year or two and consider portfolio management on the buy side, how would you characterize the opportunities these days to go ahead and consummate some of those fold-in type deals based on your discussions with folks in Mexico, Italy, and elsewhere?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That is something, which is out there for us. However it is not something, which we decide. And our partner gets to make that call on that timing. And so as it happened in Taiwan and Korea, the partner will... that they will give us some earning [ph] but not a lot. And that's fine with us because we maintain the capital to do these things and the balance sheet to do these things. But for right now, we continue to believe our partners add value. They are good for the business and we're happy to be in the position we are in.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And then question on the Merchant business, I understand you are implementing a new fuel surcharge rather for May 1st. Am I correct in understanding that that's a nominal adder, if you will, and if that's the case have you ever looked at moving to an index based on diesel maybe so that it’s close to in a rolling fashion?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, that's actually what we do have, Kevin. Essentially what we do is look at the three quarter rolling average of diesel and set the surcharge accordingly. Now, what we are doing now is essentially adding a new line on that because it has rolled up to a new higher level, roughly $0.70, $0.75 higher in the quarter. But that's basically what we continue to do. And then our customers can look at this if diesel does go down they can see what threshold or surcharge would come off.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: And just to clarify, what was that new line fee and has this had an impact on your margins for the last quarter or so?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It really hasn't... this… there is… what we're trying to do in all these activities is anticipate where we think diesel is going. So we had in place in January pretty much did cover us in North America for the quarter and this is basically a speculating where we see diesel going. The numbers, we look at are different than say what the price is at the pump. We are purchasing at a different price.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Kevin, the impact on here is to actually keep ourselves hold on these things and that's how we go and talk to our customers about it.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Understood and then finally on the new air separation units, are Reidsville and Ashland still on track for mid calendar '08 and late '08 respectively?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. They are.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thank you guys.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Shaw with UBS.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Hey, good morning, guys. You covered a lot already, but I still have a couple of quick ones.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Good morning, Chris.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure, Chris.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Just curious, in Tonnage, would margins have been flat or up if without the sort of increase in natural gas cost?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In Tonnage, no, as far as for the year is concerned, they would have been down a little bit because of the expenses on bidding.
Chris Shaw - UBS: All right, okay. And then you mentioned what the impact on volumes in Merchant was in North America from the lack of availability of helium and argon. If those were being available, what volumes would look like?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Nelson.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Yes, we would have seen growth there. It's… those are in the scheme of things just portions, the LOX/LIN drives the business there in terms of volumes, but it would have been worth a couple of percent probably.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay. And then I think in the comments around Electronics, I think there was a mention that without equipment it would have been up about 10% this quarter. Then, you also said it's going to be... you might... you thought it might accelerate into a 3Q because of the foundry activity. Would you be… do you expect growth faster than 10% than in third quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly, what we expect to see is growth from a sequential basis. On year-on-year, we also saw a pickup in last year in that thing. So as far as the growth from prior year, the 10% growth is probably a good number for us.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay, that’s all I have. Thanks, guys.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: You're welcome.
Operator: We'll hear next from Mark Gulley with Soleil.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Good morning, guys. I have got two questions.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi, Mark.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Mark.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Trying to measure the degree of competitive intensity in Tonnage bidding. One of your global competitors has upped the ante in terms of going after Tonnage projects. But given the number of projects that are out there, are you noticing any sharper degree of competition for those projects amongst the three players that go after [inaudible] Gas basis?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. It has always been intense, Mark.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Okay. And then secondly with respect to the plants that you are going to be announcing here pretty soon, can you give us any idea of the split, hydrogen versus atmospheric [inaudible] or maybe U.S. versus international, just help us, compare us for what’s coming at this?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The buckle are hydrogen projects and the bulk are in the U.S. or Canada.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: And finally, on the Merchant side, I know we've talked about this already with equipment a lot of things going on, but can you attribute, at least against my model, you are kind of down. Can you attribute any of this weakness to the economy or do you think really it's not the economy at all given your markets?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: We are still tracking in line with that IP number, industrial production number around 2%. The base business has grown year-on-year, as I have said earlier, driven by LOX/LIN. A couple of things pulled us down in the quarter, the availability of helium and argon. Also though in terms of a comparison, we’ve had very strong hydrogen spot sales last year in the first quarter. We did a six-week long job to support an SMR that was down and that did help our volumes. This year that wasn't there this quarter... I should say help last year and it wasn't there this quarter. But in general, one of the things we keep watching is what's going on in the base business. The base business is expanding not at the same rate it was last year, but it is expanding. And the signings continue to be strong. So we are happy with where we are right now.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Okay, thank you.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Yep.
Operator: We will take our next question from Michael Sison with Keybanc.
Michael Sison - Keybanc Capital: Hey, guys.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi, Mike.
Michael Sison - Keybanc Capital: In Electronics with the product rationalization effort sort of closing, I think as I recall by year-end to get to the 15%, what's left just to grow into the business for the margin?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, we continue to take actions on price and we continue to take actions on cost reduction and saving costs. So there are a lot of things. We would expect to see the impact of the new materials, which we've talked about. Also helping to grow margins in that business because they are going to come in and they're going to add us a slug of growth in on the business and they are going to come at a good margin too.
Michael Sison - Keybanc Capital: Okay. And back to Merchant real quick, you commented that pretty good order backlog, I suppose, and, so should we see the volumes in North America and Europe sort of accelerate to a degree into the second half of the year?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, that's our expectation.
Michael Sison - Keybanc Capital: And to what degree, they get back to that high single digits, mid single digits?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Mid single is probably fair.
Michael Sison - Keybanc Capital: Okay. Then, in terms of pricing in North America, it’s been pretty strong, are you getting any incremental margin on that or is that just strictly to offset the higher cost?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The answer is that on the margins and they continue to improve. The pricing to a large extent is geared on recovering cost. But the other thing, which we continue to work on, is driving our cost out of the business, our fixed cost or SG&A cost and so, and those help improve the margin.
Michael Sison - Keybanc Capital: Okay. And last question, in Solar, I know it's a small business, what's the market growing and is this more of a Tonnage or a Merchant opportunity?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Want to take that, Nelson?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Yes, it's, what we like about the growth in Solar is with the newer technology, the thin-film technology, there is a much higher industrial gases intensity versus polycrystal and silicon. And what that means is really a mix of products, it's going to be very good for industrial gases but also specialty gases, xylene, NF3, and others that we actually do have a good position on products such as phosphorus oxychloride, for example, that we've been making for 15 years and it requires a lot of... it presents a lot of handling challenges. We've been supplying it to the industry for a long time. That appears to be one of the chemistries that we've used in greater volume. So, it will... it's going to be very good for us across the board.
Michael Sison - Keybanc Capital: Right. Thank you.
Operator: Next from Oppenheimer, we'll hear from Edward Yang.
Edward Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: All my questions have been answered. Thank you.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Okay, Ed. Thanks.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Ed.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi, Bob.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Quick question maybe it's more a theoretical one, but as we're seeing natural gas prices going north of $10 and I guess there is conversions to oil, you could even dream up a $15 gas number. Is this... so what's the net effect? I would think some of your customers are getting compromised by this, on the other hand there is probably some folks who could use gas that haven't yet. So how do you see that playing out, Paul?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The net impact of prices on the Energy side for us is positive, for us. And so the thing, as we've said industrial gases are used to help improve the efficiency of processes on the Energy side, they are also used to take and to substitute fuels in. And so as you go on the environmental side and you want to go to [inaudible] your fuel, industrial gas save a lot of things to help and use the alternate fuel. So on the higher energy price side, we actually see that as a positive force.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: And are there any customers that become problematic from a credit standpoint just because of high gas, energy prices are not making any money or is that not an issue?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I don't think it's a... and it will be impossible to say none. But I actually think that the... as prices for on the energy side rise, people are able to get those pass-through the economy because people see that all over. And so it does, it is need to think for people to go out and claim the need… an increase in price on and so what we see is that our customers are holding up well in this time period.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thanks very much.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Okay.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Operator: And at this time it appears we have no further questions. I’ll hand the conference back to the management for any closing comments.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Jimmy. Please go to our web site to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 P.M. today. Thank you for joining us and have a nice day.
Operator: And that will conclude our conference. Again thank you all for your participation today. We do hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Thank you Christina. Good morning and welcome to Air Products quarterly earnings teleconference. This is Nelson Squires. Today our CFO, Paul Huck and I will review our first quarter results. We issued our earnings release this morning, and it is available on our website along with the slides for this teleconference. Please go to airproducts.com and click on the scrolling red banner to access the materials. Instructions for accessing the replay of this call beginning at 2:00 PM Eastern Time are also available on the website. Two other items, before we get started this morning. First; Air Products will host its annual meeting of shareholders tomorrow, Thursday, January 24th at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Go to airproducts.com to access the live audio webcast. And second, just as a reminder, we have revised our business segment reporting structure, restated financial history was distributed this morning. Beginning this quarter the Polymer Emulsions business is being accounted for as discontinued operations. And results for our Polyurethane Intermediates business, whose business model is very similar to our Tonnage Gases segment, with long-term contracts and raw material cost pass through provisions are now included in the Tonnage segment. Please turn to slide 2. As always, today's teleconference will contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations regarding important risk factors. Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of today's earnings release. Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Nelson. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Now please turn to slide number 3, for our review of this quarter's results from continuing operations. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter. A strong start to fiscal 2008, sales grew 9%, growth was constrained by a tough comparison in our Equipment and Energy segment, excluding Equipment and Energy, sales grew 15% driven by better volumes in pricing across most segments. Currency contributed 4%. We continue to make progress, reusing SG&A as a percentage of sales. This quarter SG&A was 12% of sales, lower than prior year and prior quarter. Operating income of $372 million was up 17% from prior year. Again due to better volumes and pricing and also improved cost performance and currency. As a result, our operating margins improved by 100 basis points to 15%, great progress towards our goal of improving our margins by 300 basis points over the next three years For the quarter, our net income and diluted earnings per share increased by 16% and 17%, respectively on a continuing operations basis, we beat the top end our guidance by $0.06. Our return on capital improved with ROCE increasing to 12.3%, up 70 basis points from last year. Please turn to slide number 4. Now let me talk about the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Higher volumes, contributed a $0.03 improvement. Higher pricing and margins together, contributed $0.05. Other costs were favorable by $0.01 as our productivity efforts continued to deliver. Our Poland acquisition contributed $0.02, favorable currency contributed $0.07. Separately, the other income line on our consolidated P&L was a bit higher this quarter than its normal run rate. This resulted from foreign exchange gains in asset management activities. Gains on asset sales were mostly offset by a write down of a startup venture included in equity affiliates income. Interest expense increased due to a higher debt balance, which was partially offset by lower interest rates. We repurchased $2 million, excuse me... we repurchased 2 million shares spending $190 million this quarter. Fewer shares outstanding contributed $0.01, all other items net to zero. The bottom line is we had a very strong first quarter and our fiscal year 2008 is off to a great start. Now, I will turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Thanks Paul. Please turn to slide five, Merchant Gases. Merchant Gases continue to grow at a solid pace during the quarter. Sales of $897 million were up 21%, versus prior year. Acquisitions contributed 6% and currencies 7%. Underlying growth was up 8%, with pricing adding 3% and volume 5%. Sequentially, Merchant Gases sales grew 5% with both volume and price, each contributing 1% and currency 3%. Merchant Gases operating income of $175 million was up 26% versus prior year and segment operating margin of 19.6% was up 80 basis points, due to continued pricing gains and volume growth. Margins rose sequentially by 150 basis points. Let me now provide a few highlights by region. Please turn to slide six. Based on request from many of you for regional data, we have decided to provide a regional sales analysis instead of specific product alignment price detail, as we have in the past. We hope you will find this change helpful. In North America, our sales increased 12% driven equally by volume and price. Overall growth would have been higher, had Argon and Helium not been in limited supply. Nitrogen sales to oil field services increased 30% year-on-year, with much of this demand coming in the vicinity of our Ashland, Kentucky and Reidsville, North Carolina plants, where we will be bringing on additional capacity later this year to meet this continuing growth. We will launch additional price and surcharge actions on 1, January of this year to address rising distribution costs. Our new business signings were outstanding in the quarter and are significantly ahead of target. Our ability to bring solutions to help deal with high energy prices in address capacity needs continues to bring in new customers at solid returns. Sales increased 31% over prior year in Europe with volume and price each contributing 3%, currency adding 13% and acquisitions adding 12%. Availability of Argon and Helium limited volume growth, new business signings were in line with expectations and reflect the continued tightness in LOX/LIN capacity on the continent. In Asia, merchant sales were up 20% over last year, volumes contributed 14%, currency 4% and price and acquisitions added 1% each. Volume growth was limited by lack of molecules in Korea and Taiwan. The underlying LOX/LIN volume growth remain strong in areas where products was not constrained. We have two plants coming on stream near term in Asia to help address capacity and an additional three plants coming on stream over the next 12 months. Please turn to slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $791 million grew 15%, compared to last year. Volumes increased 5% versus prior year. Natural gas and raw material prices were high versus prior year and added 5%, currency added 3% and acquisitions 2%. Sequentially, volumes were down as expected due to seasonal maintenance by our customers. Operating income of $111 million was up 16%, compared to last year. The increase over prior year was due to higher volumes, improved plant efficiencies and asset sales. This was partially offset by higher maintenance spending and higher bidding expenses related to significant growth opportunities. The sequential decrease of 6% was due to higher maintenance spending. Operating margin of 14% was slightly higher than last year and was held down by higher natural gas cost pass through and higher maintenance cost. This reduced margins sequentially as well. We received letters of intent for five major Tonnage contracts during the quarter. These were included in our previous CapEx guidance. We will formerly announce each of them over the next few quarters. We were honored to have the President of Mexico at the dedication of our new nitrogen facility supporting Pemex's Enhanced Oil Recovery business. The plant started up on time, on budget and at specifications. We also started up an on-site this quarter in China for a steel customer. We will bring four additional large plants on stream in fiscal '08 including our second hydrogen plant for Petro-Canadas Refinery in Edmonton, Alberta. As demonstrated by our growing number of new projects, bidding activity remains high with outstanding opportunities around the world. Please turn to slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $514 million were up 6%, compared to last year. Volume gains accounted for 6%, lower equipment sales... lower equipment results reduced sales by 1%. Pricing reduced sales by 1% and currency added 2%. Electronics sales were up 4%, compared to last year, driven by higher sales in specialty materials and offset by lower equipment sales. Excluding equipment, sales increased 7%. Electronic sales were up 2% sequentially due to higher return of sales. In Performance Materials, volumes grew 4% and our new product volumes improved 15% versus prior year and now represent more than 15% of the portfolio. We are seeing increasing demand for our environmentally friendly products as well as those with improved energy efficiency and productivity. Performance Materials volumes were down 10% sequentially due to normal seasonal demand patterns. Overall, operating income of $66 million was up 33% versus prior year. Operating margin up 12.8% was up 260 basis points versus prior year. We are seeing the impact of the Electronics portfolio improvement as well as the continued penetration of our formulated products in Performance Materials. Margins were up 120 basis points sequentially reflecting the impact of restructuring and increased sales and higher margin products. We just announced the new plant of Signet Solar and are seeing bidding activity for new projects increase. We expect to see continued solid progress in improving our margins this year. Please recognize overall revenue growth will be lower due to our SKU reduction efforts. However, we are already beginning to see these efforts payoff in margin expansion. Please turn to slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $100 million in this segment decreased due to a one time sale of some offsite work for our refinery customer last year, as well as lower LNG activity. On a sequential basis, sales declined 19% largely due to lower LNG activity. Operating income of $9 million decreased versus prior year and versus prior quarter. Last year's results benefited from an LNG order cancellation payment. Our backlog of projects in this segment now totals $246 million. As we announced yesterday, we received an LNG heat exchanger order during the quarter and expect to receive additional LNG and large ASU orders later this fiscal year. Please turn to slide 10, Healthcare. Healthcare segment sales of $171 million were up 10%, compared to prior year, due primarily to better performance in Europe. Sequentially, sales were up 7%, reflecting strong results in Europe and some improvement in the U.S. business. Operating income of $14 million was up, versus prior year and higher European results. Overall margins improved to 8% in the quarter, versus 6% a year ago and were up 250 basis points sequentially. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Nelson. Now, to turn to slide 11. As we look forward, from quarter one to quarter two, we are forecasting our second quarter earnings per share on a continuing operations basis to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.21. This excludes any divesture gains or pension settlement charges and represents year-on-year growth of 21% to 25%. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. In Merchant Gases, we look to drive new applications and continue to implement price increases and fuel based surcharges. In Electronics, we expect higher equipment sales and further benefits from our product rationalization efforts. In Performance Materials, quarter one, as expected, was a seasonally low volume period for this business. We, therefore, expect to see a seasonal rebound in volumes in quarter two. Equity affiliate income should improve sequentially as well, and finally, we expect our productivity efforts will continue to expand our margins. Somewhat offsetting these sequential improvements is our forecast for lower operating results in our Equipment and Energy segment, due to higher energy development spending. In quarter two, we do expect to close our polymer sale to Wacker. We are currently estimating a before tax gain of $65 million to $85 million. Quarter two will also see the bulk of our pension settlement charge recorded. For the year, we are currently forecasting a charge of $25 million to $30 million with the quarter two portion being $24 million to $26 million. Turning to slide 12, our outlook for the full year, last quarter, we gave you fiscal year 2008 guidance of $4.80 to $5, which included both a full year of polymers and a 2008 portion of our pension settlement charge. This quarter, we move polymers to discontinued operations. This lowers our guidance from continuing operations by $0.17 and based on the confusion it created, we have also decided to exclude the pension settlement charge. This raises guidance by $0.07, therefore, excluding these items, an equivalent range for the full year guidance we gave you last quarter, would now be $4.70 to $4.90. Due to our strong first quarter performance, continued growth from our new investments and improved margins from our productivity efforts, we are raising our guidance by $0.15 on the bottom end and $0.10 on the top end, to $4.85 to $5. Based upon fiscal year 2007 EPS from continuing operations of $4.20, which excludes $0.30 of one time net gains, we are forecasting a year-on-year increase of 15% to 19%. Turning to slide no 13, as we look at economic activity through the first quarter of this year, it is tracking in line with the projections we gave you in last quarter's year end call. There has been a lot of talk on the possibility of a U.S. recession. We have not seen evidence of this in our results. As we have said before, slowing in manufacturing from the housing decline has been almost offset by increased exports, due to a weaker $1. As we look to the future, demand for industrial gases is driven by the value they bring to our customer and I cannot remember a time, when the demand factors have been more positive for us. Industrial gases are used to increase energy efficiency, increase the throughput and capital efficiency of machinery and equipment, improve the end product quality and improve environmental performance. The prospect of sustained higher energy prices is driving significant new opportunities in both our merchant and tonnage businesses, as customers look to increase the energy efficiency of their processes by using industrial gases. Manufacturers today are seeing high capital costs for new equipment and also difficulties and delays in sighting and permitting new investments. Many of our customers are choosing to use industrial gases to de-bottleneck our existing plans and therefore, add low cost capacity quickly. We are also seeing much stricter environmental regulations on all manufactures and these pressures are creating great opportunities in both our merchant and tonnage businesses. Finally, our global businesses are well positioned in the areas of greatest future investment, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North America. We believe, this gives us a distinct advantage over our competitors. This is evidenced by our global leadership in hydrogen for clean fuels, oxygen for gasification and Electronics, where our market focus brings the best applications and broadest range of products and solutions to our customers. Recently, there have been some analyst reports suggesting Air Products is more cyclical and could under perform its competitors during a downturn. Let me assure you that the steps we have taken to transform our company since the last economic downturn have solved this problem. As you know, we were not pleased by our performance during the last downturn from 2001 through 2003. The actions we have taken over the last few years to change Air Products into a more focused less cyclical, higher growth and higher return company were aimed at delivering sustainable results during the periods of economic uncertainty. Please turn to slide number 14. Let me discuss a number of the actions that we have taken. We have moved to global business units in the past four years. This is resulted in considerable expansion overseas and we now have 56% of our sales outside of the United States, compared to 44% in 2000. With the sale of our emulsions assets in the next quarter, we will be out of the cyclical chemicals businesses. The downturn in our former Amines and Emulsions businesses were major contributors to our underperformance. We have made major changes to our Electronics business, significantly lowering its cost of conducting business, exiting a low margin product lines, introducing new higher margin products and winning a significant amount of new Tonnage business. This has made Electronics a much better business with solid fundamentals better margins and higher returns. Also, the Electronics industry has changed itself. As you will remember the downturn in the Electronics industry was a major contributor to our performance issues. The initiative has gone through a shake out and consolidation has occurred. Fundamentally, the industry has shown its ability to better manage supply and demand relationships, production in inventory without any significant cycles occurring over the past four years. We have also increased our percentage of business under long-term Tonnage contracts from 26% in 2000 to 36% today. The Tonnage business is surely contractually from the ups and down of the economy and we have the largest percentage of any of our industrial gases competitors. We have simplified, standardized and globalized our work process, underpinning them with a single instance of SAP. Across our businesses worldwide, we have reduced our cost of doing business, this has decreased our SG&A as a percent of sales from 14% in 2004 to 12% today. Our Merchant business during the last downturn had significant excess capacity at lower margins, we have done a lot to fundamentally improve that business and to manage capacity, price and margins better. Additionally, we have focused a large amount of our sales activity on applications and it is paying off. Our new business signings over the past quarters... over the past quarter were at record levels globally. We've been very disciplined in our use of capital, focusing it on our best opportunities and we'll return to shareholders over $1.5 billion through stock buyback in the past three years. Finally, as evidenced by the achievement of our ORONA goals last year, we have significantly improved the returns across our business and we have achieved record levels in 2007. We however are not satisfied with this and have set aggressive goals to increase our margins and returns over the next three years. You can see by the improvements we have demonstrated in this first quarter that we are serious about delivering this 300 basis point improvement in margins over the next three years. The bottom line is that we believe we are well positioned both near term and long term to grow earnings, increase cash generation and improve returns resulting in greater shareholder value. The focus of our actions over the past few years has been to get us positioned well around the world in the key markets with strong businesses, excellent products and the right solutions for our customers to deliver results for our shareholders. We have done that and we look forward to capitalizing on this great opportunity. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Christina to take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from PJ Juvekar with Citi.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Yes, good morning Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning PJ.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi, PJ.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: In Tonnage Gases, you mentioned that margins were constrained by higher bidding expenses. Can you elaborate on that? Is this happening in U.S. or Asia? And what is the competitive activity right now?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In the constraint it was not a lot PJ. But it did impact us. It just it goes backs to the bidding activity which we have and we expense those cost as we continue to bid. And it gets back to the drivers which I talked about, trying to drive bid as possibly you look at things to save energy, as we look for clean fuels, if you look at gasification. We look to people who will take and expand our plants to the de-bottleneck, improve our metal performance and that's happening for us around the world. It's happening in the U.S., its happening in Canada, its happening in Asia, in Central Europe.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Is there a particular... I am sorry go ahead.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The Middle East also.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Okay. Is there a particular product like LOX/LIN or hydrogen that is getting more competitive?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well no... in your comp... your question on competition, everything in the markets and they are competitive. I mean... and I don't think the intensity is actually exceptionally increasing there. We have always competed with the large industrial gas companies around the world on these things. I think the thing which we look at is we are seeing very strong demand for those products around the world. Oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen which are primary Tonnage products.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: And you mentioned about SKU reductions in Electronics, can you tell us how much of the revenue is impacted and what were the margins on those revenues, maybe like 2% or 3% margins in those businesses?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And if you look at that and we have said, its probably somewhere between $80 million to $100 million a year in revenue, which are coming off by the exits of those products for us and those... and the drop was... and those products went from... as we looked at them from some lost money to some and they made money. But as we looked at that, the margins were poor.
Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup: Great. Thank you.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman, Sachs: Thanks very much. Paul I don't often do a cheerleading good quarter, I won't this time, but I have to say, that was a pretty inspiring defense of your outlook you gave there a minute ago.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Bob.
Robert Koort - Goldman, Sachs: Maybe a little bit more granularity on the Electronics side. When you look at the 260 basis points year-on-year margin improvement, I am trying to assess how much of that is one off from the HPPC divestiture and how much of it is the early stages of business optimization, of what you have got? Can you help me out there?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Bob the... on the results which you were looking at the HPPC divestiture is completely out of all the years. So that was put in discontinued operations.
Robert Koort - Goldman, Sachs: Well, okay.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: All due to... its all due to all other things which you talked about, restructuring the business, dropping at a product lines, increasing our Tonnage revenues, the products and getting to a low cost supply and rationalizing our businesses.
Robert Koort - Goldman, Sachs: Okay, great. And then secondly, if I may, Nelson you talked about adding some new letters of intent on the Tonnage side, can you give us some sense of what those look like on a return hurdle basis and maybe how that's changed over the last three or four years? Did we hit a plateau... we're now the competitive environment has sort of stabilized or you are still seeing enough project activity that bid hurdles can continue to increase?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: We... these projects are definitely going to increase our overall returns. They have been all very good projects for us, a combination of both hydrogen, probably majority hydrogen and some nitrogen and oxygen. We are very pleased with these, with key customers and areas where we want to grow. And as Paul stated, obviously the bidding activity is intense, but we are winning more than our fair share because of our offerings and the infrastructure that we have.
Robert Koort - Goldman, Sachs: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeffrey Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Hi, good morning.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations:
Hi Jeff:
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Jeff.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: On the cash flow statement, the gain on sale of assets is $6.2 million, what... I take it that that's the number that passed through your income statement?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes it is.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: What was the magnitude of the charge that asset write down you talked about?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And the write down was... and the write downs overall were close to that.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: But that's not included in that line?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, it is not, and the equity affiliate line, it does not get included there.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: So it's like $4 billion or $5 billion is that what you mean for the right?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No Jeff, I didn't sell the asset there, so, if I would have sold those assets, it would have been, I just took a loss on the asset because of the venture.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay and then secondly, your currency gains were, or the currency benefit was $0.07, does that include hedging gains, or is that exclusive of hedging gains?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It includes those gains, but I will be honest with you. We do not do a lot in the... in hedging gains which are not exactly matched until that is not a lot of activity for us.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: And then lastly, is your... are your targets for equipment and energy operating income higher for 2008 now, or lower or the same, given that you had such a nice first quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: About the same.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: About the same, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Merrill Lynch, Don Carson.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Couple of questions on earnings visibility, Nelson you talked about your new business signings in Merchant being at a higher rate in calendar '07 and continuing, as you look at that, what kind of volume growth does that give you? And also an additional question on equity affiliate income, now that the Pemex Project has started up, what kind of quarterly increase should we see in equity affiliate income?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: I will take the volume one and then pass it over to Paul for the second question Don. As I have said in these calls before, one of the things that we are benefiting by is has been the acceleration of signings over the last couple of years and we were laying a very good baseline for growth in the coming quarters and coming fiscal years, so a lot of what we saw in this first quarter was the benefit of what we had signed in the previous, say three or four quarters. That all being said, it still gives us in terms of new growth, somewhere in neighborhood of 4% or 5% expectations for this year in LOX /LIN, obviously, LAR and Helium are going to be dampen, because of their availability, but we still see pretty solid growth and the other adding comment to that is that our base business continues to move along, meaning the base business is still growing for us. Now I will turn it over to Paul for the Pemex.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure Nelson thanks. If we look at that project, Don, that project for the year probably adds about $0.02 to $0.03 of share for us.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And that of the cost of financing the deal.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Nelson just to clarify on the Merchant selling, so you are targeting 4% to 5% new growth and in LIN/LOX and then base growth should still be what, sort of in the 3% or 4% range?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Yes, that's probably more of a blended number. So I think we are seeing a high rate of conversions which is you know, we are typically converting 2% to 3% a year, so if you take that off, adding nominal base business growth to the new growth, its still looking like a 5% number.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: All right. Okay, thank you.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from Deutsche Bank, David Begleiter.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you, good morning.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Morning David.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Dave.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Hey Paul, just in Europe, are you seeing any pockets of weakness in the economy either by region or by industry?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly, if you go to Europe, Dave, Western Europe is not as strong as the East. So, if we look at the growth, the growth is strongest for us in our Polish assets there, and our Czech assets, which we have there, so that's the area of greatest growth. The UK obviously, is a slow area also, but... and the best areas are really on the Eastern and Central.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Just on the pricing front, Paul, North America, what's your full year expectation now for Merchant pricing gains in North America?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If we look at pricing gains then this is going to depend upon what happens on energy pricing obviously, because of pass-throughs, but we would expect our prices to continue to go up through the year, whether we get to overall of 3% or 4% gain would probably be a good expectation for us I would say.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: And lastly, on the Merchant side, given the pace of new business signings, are you gaining share as in North America?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And that's always hard to tell over one particular period, but we think we are doing well. We are certainly gaining share on the applications end, as we look at certain things. So we look at certain markets like our glass and the oilfield services and stuff like that, we... our expansions there are doing very, very well.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from New Vernon Associates, Steve Schuman.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: Good morning guys.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Hi Steve.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good Morning Steve.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: Hey how are you? I applaud your new JV as far as opening up... potentially opening up in Middle East, but what about some opportunities you are closer to home, on particularly oil sands, obviously, you have a couple of hydrogen deals out there, what I am getting to hear about more, both hydrogen on the oil sands processing side and also potential gasification from power and steam?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We continue to work in the area and so... and we are quite active and we are hopeful that we will have an announcement sometime within the next year of our project in that area.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: But any of those five projects be up there at this point that you have announced, but...
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, no they are not.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: What's sold off, are they... are the companies out there more interested in doing it themselves, either building their own plant or just buying a plant from you?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No they are large investments, Steve, and so they... and they take it... is in the multiple billions of dollars and so they take a long time to get these things to come together. But we are convinced with the position that we have and the customers, who we have served up in that area that we are uniquely positioned to win jobs in that area.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: Great thank you.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: Hi good morning.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Good morning Mike.
Mike Harrison - First Analysis: You guys in your... one of your mid quarter sales updates, you reported that Tonnage Gases sales were up 24% through the first two months of the quarter and then it came out today with 15% for the full quarter, obviously, I think there was some impact in there from the reclassification of the PUI business, but I was wondering if you could talk about what you saw in December in terms of Tonnage Gases sales, maybe what the prior year comp looked like for December, and then as we look in, in the March quarter, we expect sales growth kind of above or below that 20% growth rate.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Mike, I think what you saw was probably the October number, as I recall. It was up very strongly, the reason why and we noted this is a point in time this currency was in there, at that... not currency, excuse me, on gas and gas was in October of last year of 2006, which is the first month of the fiscal year, it was quite low, it was in the $4.80 range I think, and it was much higher, it was close to $7 for us in this year, and so that pushed sales up a lot. The other thing which just held down the year-to-year growth, as you look at this in my Tonnage segment is the movement of the Polyurethane Intermediates business, into that segment, and that obviously is not a business of growth for us, so that is held back down. The other thing is that I think in '07, we had just, we were just beginning to make a startup for a plant in the Gulf coast to that point in time and so we didn't get a full month of sale, so there is little volume carryover. But if you look at this and we look forward, we certainly would not expect to see 20% sales growth on the Tonnage business going forward. I think it's going to be in the single digit... high single digit range for us for the rest of the year depending obviously on gas prices.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: Okay thanks. And then on the Healthcare segment, obviously still we're not quite where you want to be with that business, but some nice improvement in margin there. I was wondering --
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: Talk about the traction that you are getting in the North American portion of that business and maybe whether you think the North American business may have turned the quarter... a corner during this quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly we started to see the North American results improve, which is a very good thing for us and we are happy about that. The rate of progress needs to get better still. We think we have... and we are encouraged, we think we have the right solutions here going forward. And that we would expect to see continuing improvement throughout the year in the Healthcare segment.
Steve Shuman - New Vernon Associates: All right, thanks very much Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Fred Siemer with Chemical Research for Wall Street.
Fred Siemer - Chemical Research for Wall Street: Yes, I have just a couple of questions.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes Fred.
Fred Siemer - Chemical Research for Wall Street: One I was surprised to hear... I think you said you had plenty of merchant capacity in the United States, that's quite a change from last year. What is your operating rate in North American merchant and how much capacity did you add as a percentage of total in the last year?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Well Fred this is Nelson. We didn't say we had a lot of capacity, the only thing we talked about in terms of capacity was the LAR and Helium and we are still tied. But operating rates have remained about the same, so as last year because we have added capacity, we have also done a significant number of conversions in the last 12 months or so. The capacity that we have added has probably added about 3% or 4% to our total U.S. production.
Fred Siemer - Chemical Research for Wall Street: You were almost 86%, 88% last year, you are running that high now?
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Yes. Yes we are.
Fred Siemer - Chemical Research for Wall Street: Okay. The other question is regarding your stock and you are pretty well completed, I think you are planned... immediate plans for divesting in chemicals. But you are still under performing perhaps there substantially, I mean your stock was 18% theirs was 16% and the PE multiple discount that Air Product suffers is still 1.5 to almost 2 which implies you are leaving $400 million of evaluation... of stock evaluation on the table by having this invisible chemicals business tucked into Tonnage Gases. You once promised us that you would try to explain the non-cyclicality and value of that chemical business. Can we look forward to that this year?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Fred, we are done on the sale of that and we did everything which we said we would do. The Polyurethane Intermediates business is the same as our Tonnage businesses. It sells to a few customers, long-term contracts, they have to take the product, they are committed to take the product, they pay us for that and we pass through the cost of raw material and we index for labor and maintenance on the plant and stuff like that. So it looks just like a contract in that business, and that's why we put it there. I don't think that that's a reason for why we are short of Praxair.
Fred Siemer - Chemical Research for Wall Street: What is the reason your gas business is as good or better than theirs? I --
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have to improve... and part of the thing is trying to get our returns up and you've seen us talk about that and we've done a good job of getting that. But we still aren't their return levels, we need to improve that and part of that is... in us showing out and trying to get the margins of the business up. And we're very serious about that, because we believe that we have a better portfolio as far as growth and positioning for that growth.
Fred Siemer - Chemical Research for Wall Street: So, we can expect nothing further in chemical divestitures?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right.
Fred Siemer - Chemical Research for Wall Street: Right, okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Glen Hill Investments, Peter Butler.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Yes, good morning, good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Peter.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Good morning Peter.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Nice to see continuing positive earnings surprises. I have two questions, first is simple I think, could you give us your projections forecast for some of the cash flow numbers, CapEx and DD&A for this year and into '09?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: If you look at, on a CapEx, what we have said is that it's a $1.1 billion to a $1.2 billion in '08. We would also expect that to grow in '09 and there's still projects to be won obviously to get that. But we would expect that to happen. As far as for this year, we probably expect our depreciation and amortization to be in the 850 range or so, and probably growing in the next year as we bring more plant. So take that up, you know 5%, 6%.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Okay. And the other question is, you are making some nice improvements in your asset mix, you should be benefiting from the weak dollar obviously etcetera. Is there any reason for you at this point to consider increasing you ROI goals or ORONA goals etcetera?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Our goals are to keep it growing and to continue to drive it higher for us. So, yes, we are trying to drive it higher.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: No, but I am asking whether, at some point here where you... could you have a significant increase in your expectations for goal... these goals, based on some of the changes that have taken place in your mix and dollar relationship etcetera, etcetera?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, and Peter, I'd rather would answer that in terms of trying to increase on the margin side. And so if you take those 300 basis points in improvement and margin and translate that to an improvement on return on capital which is simple, and you can see the goals are higher.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Yes.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And those things are put in there as far as changes in currency, it really doesn't increase... that doesn't change what happens as far as my return on capital goals because the numerator and denominator are affected by both those things. So it's about the same impact on both things, it doesn't move it. But certainly going into good projects helps us.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: All right. Thanks for the help guys.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mike Judd with Greenwich Consultants.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: All right. Yes, congratulations to also on a good quarter. I am just, given the uncertainty in the equity markets now, I'm just wondering, obviously your businesses are doing well. But, are there any areas where you are seeing any weakness in either domestically or international, just anything that, you might want to give us a little bit of heads up on?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: What were you seeing Mike and we had talked about this before is that we did see some drop in the housing related markets, 18 months ago it started for us. And those have continued to be low. But we have been able to go out and offset most of them especially as we look at... on the export business. These export markets have done very, very well for us and have actually helped us because they have lot more exposure on export markets than we do on housing markets internally within Air Products.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: And if there is a slower growth globally, you guys were just basically tying your belts a little bit, is this that kind of the take away also there?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Absolutely.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Banc of America Securities.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Securities: Yes good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Kevin.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Good morning Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Securities: Paul, how would you prioritize uses of free cash flow and specifically, given your constructive outlook and the volatility in the stock market should we expect repurchases at a steady rate, so much of the $190 million in this quarter or you see potential to accelerate that activity?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: All right, as far as the priorities are first to spend money on good projects and acquisitions and JV buyouts which execute our strategy, that's obviously the first one. The next one would be maintaining the A bond rating for us, then we look at increasing dividend within the 30% to 40% range, and then the last one is that money goes back to the shareholders. And so what... and that's what you have seen from us for the past two to three years and we are going to continue that. So yes, I would expect the ability to continue but to go out and buyback shares, provided that I am not presented with a great acquisition opportunity or something like that which is... but currently within these... on the capital spending guidance which is out there, what you can see is that it would result in a share buyback rate about even with what you saw in the first quarter.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Securities: That's helpful. And then I had a few questions on the Tonnage business, if I look at your volume growth there of 5% in the quarter, is that a reasonable base line growth rate to think about exclusive of new plants start up? And then on the subject, that new plants start ups, is your hydrogen unit in Edmonton for Petro-Canada still on track for the second calendar quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The answer to that is, that it starts up right at the beginning... last question, is that it starts up right at beginning of the third... of our third quarter. So yes, that's right in the April timeframe, yes it is there. As far as growth on the Tonnage side, to drive growth in there in that business, we actually need to bring in new investments. And so, we do sell some, but we are... we're selling a lot today, as far as the system is concerned. So the underlying growth of that business depends upon being able to spend capital.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Securities: And then finally on Tonnage, what was the magnitude of PUI sales that you transferred out of the old chemical segment into tonnage in the quarter?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It's about $300 million a year.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jefferies, Laurence Alexander.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Laurence.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: Good morning Laurence.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: I guess, first question on the pricing cycle in Merchant Gases in Europe. Do you think if the conditions are tightened up but even in a stable environment in Europe, you'd be able to maintain a pricing cycle the way you have in the U.S.?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: And would it still be around 2%, 3%?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, could be. Yes.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: And on the... in terms of the Tonnage business, in terms of the growth prospect, if you look at the projects that you are confident you are signing or that the ones that you might be announcing near term, plus the once that you think are likely after that. What do you think is a good reasonable volume growth rate for Tonnage over the next three years?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In a long-term I think in the low teens.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: On the volume side?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, 12, 13 on the volume side.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: Okay. And that will be over three to five years?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, yes, right.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: Perfect. And then in the past sometimes you have discussed doing acquisitions to double or triple the size of Performance Materials. Given the improvement in your returns, in the industrial gas side, has that dropped off as a priority?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, but we need to get the right properties. We continue to look and explore in that area,
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: And are you seeing those properties coming available or is that sort of more hypothetical at this point?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. we continue to work at opportunities, but as I said the opportunity has to be in... the right markets, have the right products and make the right return.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: Perfect. And then just to be clear on Healthcare margins, it sounds as if you are still on track for your two to three year goals on North American Healthcare margin?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, but its early days, but we continue to work hard at it.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies and Company: Okay perfect, Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Chris Shaw with UBS.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Hey guys, good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Chris.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: : Hi Chris.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Have you... are there any assumptions that you can share with guidance in terms of the high end, low end, is there sales number that goes with the high end or low end, or any sort of the industrial production estimate, is there anything you can share around that?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well certainly, if you go back to our guidance, in the beginning of the year, we said globally, maybe 3% and 3.5%, global for the manufacturing markets globally, so that's a number which fits there. I think on the other end of the guidance, some of the things which is, is our ability to really deliver on some new product successes etcetera in our businesses.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay. And then quickly, I think it was mentioned that 2Q tax rate will be lower, how lower you talked about, what was the reason?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Slight.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Not... its... and the tax rate is going to bounce a little bit all the time on us, but we try give a year guidance and it depends on when... on when we are able to book certain benefits.
Chris Shaw - UBS: Okay, great, thanks.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You are welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mark Gulley with Soleil Security.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Hi good morning, guys. I got three questions.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Mark.
Nelson Squires - Director of Investor Relations: : Hey Mark.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: I wanted to talk about competition in CapEx, as I look at your U.S. competitor and one of your European competitors; it looks as if they are spending more as a percent of sales and in the case of European competitor, one of them doubled in terms of dollars, in terms of CapEx. So do you view that as a kind of a ratcheting up of CapEx spending by your competitors, can you compete at a somewhat lower level of CapEx, can you provide some help there please Paul?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We certainly think the CapEx which we are spending is right, right now for us, and it correlates with the wins which we have had, we think we are maintaining or expanding our competitive position. I don't know the exact areas in which everyone is spending; you would have to ask them to get to, to put them together. But we have also paid a lot of attention trying to drive our cost of plants down, too in this environment.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Okay. Secondly, it looks to me, like you are showing two measures two metrics for returns, of ROCE and ORONA, are you going to focus on one of the other, in terms of how you project that to us, in terms of how your comp is determined?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No they actually track together and we are... and we have comp programs which actually stretch out a few years and so, we still have some programs which track ORONA and the ones which we introduced this year to track return on capital employed and so we are going to share both.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Finally, I want to wrap-up with the question on coal to chemicals, certainly, Pioneer along with Eastman; are any of the five projects that you are going to announce in the next couple of quarters associated with coal gasification particularly, perhaps in the U.S.?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, on those part of projects, but we have been, we are working very hard with, GTE on the IGCC plants there. To get that and it's been announced and we are going to, be with them on those. And we should have something occurring in the near future.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Thanks Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: And our final question will come from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer & Co.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you. Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Ed.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: My question is on industry competition and obviously the industries changed a lot for the better and become more consolidated and you mentioned that your utilization levels in North America are remaining fairly stable and at higher levels. What's your sense Paul, in terms of how much per cushion you have, in terms of how much utilization could dip down before you might see some more price competition in the industry and would that level be, now be at a higher point than, or a lower point than it was may be 10 years ago when there were more competitors.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would not see the utilization of the plants dropping it, and it goes back to the stuff which I talked about before, about the way, there is way in people use their gases, so if we go look at things, say energy prices are high, environmental performance, people are trying to go out and work on their plants, I mean, for us, our signings are at the highest levels ever, in the U.S. Highest levels ever, and so I would not see a drop in that occurring, it's hard to imagine.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: In the off chance that you do see it dropping in terms of your own mindset, would you tolerate lower utilization and keep pricing relatively high or would you try to optimize the utilization more than the pricing?
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: A thing you have to remember is that we do have long term contracts and so a drop in pricing is not going to precipitate everyone coming in and getting a price decrease. So what happens is that we have these contracts for five years on the bulk of our customers and so I would not see an easing off. So, for us, it would probably result in the way, which we would go out and do that is, cut back on expansions for things, cut back maybe somewhat on our conversion efforts and try to manage our capacity that way.
Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, thank you very much.
Paul E. Huck - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: And at this time, there appears to be no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back over to the speakers, for any closing or additional remarks.

Please review the Safe Harbor language on this slide and at the end of today's earnings release. Now I will turn the call over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Nelson. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Please turn to slide number 3, we had another solid quarter. A pretty end to an other strong year in 2007 with continued growth in sales and earnings while delivering operating leverage to the bottom line. And most importantly, we continue to improve our return on capital. I'm glad to say we achieved our ORONA target of 12.5% for fiscal year 2007. We entered the year forecasting double digit earnings per share growth and improvements in our return on capital. And we delivered on these commitments. Turning to slide number 4, looking to our results for fiscal 2007, sales grew by 15% or more than $1 billion to $10 billion due to higher volumes broadly across all segments. Operating income was up 23%, earnings per share increased by 25%. And ORONA improved by 110 basis points. The continued strength of our operating cash flow allowed us to repurchase $567 million in shares, the third consecutive year we brought back $500 million or more of our stock with just under a $0.5 million remaining under a previous authorization last month, our board authorized an additional $1 billion towards share repurchases. Please turn to slide 5. This quarter we had a number of items that occurred. Let me clarify the impacts of these items. This slide isolates them to arrive at our underlying performance. First, we recognized a $0.04 loss on our Electronics High Purity Process Chemicals Business or HPPC as we've entered in to an arrangement to sell the business, which we announced this morning. HPPC generated $87 million of revenues in 2007. We've reclassified the results for 2006 and 2007 to discontinued operations as we expect to close by the end of the calendar year. This was a low margin business and its sale represents another step in improving the profitability, margins and returns of our electronics business. Second, as we told you last quarter, we settled on a polyurethane intermediates contract termination and recorded a $37 million or $0.11 per share gained in our chemical segment. Third, we reduced our ownership in Air Water, a Japanese industrial gas company, we donated 65% of our investment to the Air Products foundation which generated the small operating loss and a significant tax benefit. We also sold and recognized, again on another 15% of our investment, combined this added $0.09 per share to this quarter's results. Fourth, as we mentioned in our previous guidance, a number of senior managers retired in 2007 and as a result, we recorded a supplemental pension plan charge, a $10 million or $0.03 per share. The accounting rules required after remaining $20 million to $25 million charge will be recognized when paid in fiscal year 2008. Fifth, we are continuing cost reduction actions started in 2006 to further simplify our business and reduce our cost of doing business. We have included the charge of roughly $14 million or $0.04 per share. The areas of focus are, a continuation of our move to shared services to streamline our operations. Rationalization of products and assets in Electronics to continue to improve margins and returns, and reduction in management and corporate services to continue to simplify our businesses. And finally, the quarter includes a $0.05 per share tax benefit related to state and foreign audit resolutions. Our guidance, as we told you last quarter, excluded the earnings impacts of these times. This slide shows what our results from continuing operations would have been excluding them. Our EPS would have been $1.17 versus our guidance of $1.10 to $1.15. This is a year- on-year increase of 26%. I'll walk you through the factors that drove this growth in EPS in a moment. Turning to slide 6, for a brief review of this quarter's operating results. Sales grew 12%, driven mainly by broad based volume growth across most segments. Currency contributed 3% and acquisitions added 2%. We continue to make progress, reducing SG&A as a percentage of sales. This quarter's SG&A was 11.6% of sales lower than prior year by 20 basis points. Operating income of $371 million was up 22% from prior year, again due to strong volume performance across the board. For the quarter, our net income was $262 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.17 when compared with prior year. Net income increased 25% and diluted EPS increased by 26%. Now, let me talk about the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms earnings per share. Higher volumes contributed $0.23 improvement. Higher pricing and raw material costs together contributed $0.05. Other costs were unfavorable by $0.12 as improving productivity efforts were more than offset by the impacts in inflation and increased cost to serve the higher volumes. Overall, we did see productivity get to the bottom line as our operating margins expanded by a 130 basis points to 14.3%. The Poland acquisition is performing well and contributed $0.03. Last year, we had a net $0.04 gain on insurance recoveries. Split fairly evenly between the merchant and tonnage segments. And also last year on our U.S. Healthcare business, we recorded a $0.05 charge for an inventory adjustment. The bottom line is we had another strong quarter and we generated 26% EPS growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?
Nelson Squires - Director, Investor Relations: Thanks Paul. Please turn to slide 8, Merchant Gases. Merchant gases capped off a great year with a strong quarter. Sales of $855 million were up 18% versus prior year. Acquisitions contributed 6%, currency 5%, pricing 4% and volume added 3%. Sequentially merchant gases sales grew 5% with volumes contributing 3%. And price and currency each adding 1%. Merchant gases operating income of $155 million was up 20% versus prior year. And segment operating margin of 18.1% was up 30 basis points. Due to pricing gains and volume growth and partially offset by hurricane insurance recovery in the prior year. Let me now provide a few highlights by region. Please turn to slide 9. In North America, our liquid bulk volume index was down 1% year-on-year. LOX/LIN volumes were up 3% versus prior year. However, overall growth was limited by the availability of argon and helium. Liquid hydrogen was down 4% due to lower government sales. Our liquid bulk volume index was up 1% sequentially due to increased spot sales of LOX/LIN with growth limited by the availability of argon and helium. Last week, we announced that we are jointly building a liquid helium production plant by Matheson in Wyoming. This new capacity is expected to come on stream in 2009. Average LOX/LIN pricing increased 3% year-on-year reflecting continued solid performance in this area. Pricing was 1% lower sequentially due to mix. In the quarter, we did announce a price increase on all products effective October 1, 2007. New business signings were strong in the quarter and well ahead of target for the year. We continue to win new orders at a high rate by bringing applications technology and know how to our customers. The European liquid bulk volume index was down 2% year-on-year mainly due to the absence of significant spot sales to one customer. We are now serving this customer via an onsite plant. Availability of argon and helium affected volume sequentially. New business signings were solid for the year, but reflect tightness in LOX/LIN availability on the continent. Our European LOX/LIN pricing was up 4% year-on-year and 1% sequentially, reflecting our continuing ability to recover higher costs. Cylinder volumes in Europe were up 3% versus prior year reflecting solid growth in new offerings. Sequentially, volumes were seasonally down 4% due mainly to summer holidays, underlying demand remained strong. In Asia, liquid bulk volumes were up 18% over last year and 8% sequentially driven by strong demand for all products. Pricing was up 3% year-on-year and 1% sequentially reflecting continued success in our recent efforts to recover higher energy and distribution costs. Please turn to slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $690 million grew 12%, compared to last year. The impact of late fiscal year 2006 plant start ups and improved plant loadings yielded 10% volume growth. Natural gas prices were lower versus prior year and decreased sales by 2%. Currency added 2% and acquisitions added 2%. Operating income of $105 million was up 1%, compared to last year. The increase over prior year was due to the volume impact of new plants and increased loading. It was offset by the absence of last year's hurricane settlement and higher maintenance spending. The sequential decrease of 5% was due mainly to higher maintenance costs. Operating margin of 15.2% decreased 170 basis points versus last year due to the prior year insurance... hurricane insurance recovery. Sequentially, margins were down as we experienced higher maintenance cost. We were selected during the quarter as a major supplier to Eastman Chemical's gasification project in Beaumont, Texas. Our scope will include the supply of 7,000 tons per day of oxygen in the offtake of hydrogen. We will distribute the hydrogen via our pipelines to refinery customers in the region. We are excited to be a part of this important new project. We also signed our third contract with Guofeng Steel during the quarter and we're building other air separation plant to support their expansion. We expect to bring six large plants on stream in fiscal '08 including our second hydrogen plant for Petro-Canada's refinery in Edmonton, Alberta and a large nitrogen facility for enhanced oil recovery for Pemex, which is currently in start up. Our bidding activity remains very high. We are actively working on more than 20 new tonnage opportunities in North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and the mid-East. Please turn to slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $523 million were up 5%, compared to last year. Volume gains accounted for 9%. Lower equipment results reduced sales by 3%, pricing reduced sales by 2% and currency added 1%. Electronics sales were up 2%, compared to last year driven by higher sales and its specialty materials while dampened by lower equipment sales. Excluding equipment sales increased 8%. Electronics sales were down 4% sequentially again due to lower equipment sales. Excluding equipment, sales increased 8%. In performance materials, volumes grew 8% and our penetration of new products improved 30% versus prior year and now represent approximately 15% of our portfolio. Overall, operating income of $61 million was up 2% versus prior year. Operating margin of 11.6% was down 40 basis points versus prior year due to higher cost associated with streamlining our business portfolio. We continued to be successful with winning majority of new fab orders. During the quarter, we received an award to supply gases to Hynix's latest expansion in Korea. We will build the new air separation plant to supply this project. In '08, we expect to see higher tonnage in specialty material revenues and lower equipment sales as capital expenditures lease off and capacity is brought on stream. While holding down revenue growth, the margins in tonnage and specialty materials are better and profits will grow faster. We will also see the impact of the skew reductions, which will reduce revenue by approximately $100 million. Please turn to slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales were $124 million in this segment decreased 4%, compared to last year and 8% sequentially. Largely due to lower LNG heat exchanger activity. Operating income of $18 million decreased 9% versus prior year. Income was up 13% versus prior quarter primarily due to favorable cost performance. Our backlog of projects in this segment now totals $258 million. Looking forward into fiscal '08, we would expect to receive some new orders for large air separation units and LNG heat exchangers. Please turn to slide 13, Healthcare. Healthcare segment sales of $160 million were up 7%, compared to prior year due primarily to better performance in Europe. Sequentially, sales were up slightly again reflecting stronger results in Europe. Operating income of $9 million was up versus prior year and higher European volumes in prior year inventory write downs. Sequentially, our margins improved 10 basis points to 5.5% driven by growth in Europe. The U.S. business remained flat during the quarter. While the U.S. business did not deliver the progress we expected this year, we have redefined the business model and changed the incentive structure. These changes have put the business on better footing as we begin this fiscal year and we expect improved results. Please turn to slide 14, Chemicals. The Chemicals segment had sales of $252 million up 13%, compared to last year and delivered operating income of $29 million, up 96% due to volume gains in both polyurethane intermediates and polymers. Now I will turn the call back over to Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks Nelson. Turning to our full year outlook on slide 15. Based on our continued strong performance coupled with the actions we are taking to deliver next year's results, our fiscal 2008 earnings per share guidance is $4.80 to $5, which represents year-on-year earnings growth from continuing operations of 10% to 14%. This will be our fifth consecutive year of double digit growth and improving return on capital. Underlying these earnings per share growth, we are forecasting sales growth of 8% to 10% and margin improvement of 100 basis points from 14% to 15% for the Company. We will continue to focus on driving improvement in our return on capital. Partially offsetting the underlying volume and margin growth, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range next year and the second tranche of our supplemental pension charge related to our cost reduction efforts that I described earlier. Now, let's look at the underlying factors that drive our volume and margin growth. Globally, we saw manufacturing grow between 3.5% to 4% in fiscal 2007. We expect 2008 to be about the same to slightly lower. In the U.S, we anticipate the low trend manufacturing growth of about 2% to 3% in fiscal 2008 or roughly the same as in fiscal 2007. Industry is tied to the housing down turn, will place the greatest drag on manufacturing. But we have little exposure there. Industries with strong export prospects where we have greater exposure will benefit from the weaker dollar and healthy overseas demand. We don't think the fundamentals lead to the economy falling into a recession. For Europe, we expect growth to continue. With the EU expansion, with Central Europe as the strongest region within Europe. And Asia will continue to be the strongest area of growth and expansion overall. Now turning to our business segments, manufacturing growth along with our efforts to raise prices and increase productivity should generate continued improvement in our Merchant Gases segment next year. We are targeting a 19% margin for 2008. In the U.S., we are continuing to operate at a high rate across our system, therefore to serve our volume growth we will continue to de-bottleneck plans and convert larger customer to small onsite. In Asia, Merchant Gases demand is growing rapidly based upon strong manufacturing growth coupled with our expanded technology applications, we continue to expect double digit volume growth across the region next year. In Europe, we are continuing the focus on improving our margins. Stimulating our business operations and utilizing shared services more broadly. In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see some benefit from new facilities loading and productivity. Refinery hydrogen project development remains high as we see the market shift from being regulatory driven to being economics driven. Right now we are actively involved in proposals to a number of refiners as they expand their transportation fuel capacity. In Equipment and Energy, after posting record profits in 2006 and again in 2007, results will be much lower as one might expect given the client in our sales backlog. We do anticipate signing several LNG orders this coming year. Although, those orders won't have a significant impact on our 2008 profit outlook. New profits for both LNG and large air separation equipment orders continued to be solid. Despite this level of activity, equipment and energy operating profits are likely to decline by about $0.15 to $0.20 per share in fiscal year 2008. In Electronics, we expect continued growth with growth in square inches of silicon process of about 7%. Our Electronics customers continue to expand, driving new investment for tonnage and merchant gases and also creating a greater demand for our specialty gases and materials. Electronics sales growth will be more moderate due to lower equipment sales and our production rationalization efforts. We expect margin improvement as we make progress with these plants in our tonnage and specialty materials grow from increased production. Our growth expectations in Performance Materials are based on the assumption that we can grow two to three times GDP to a combination of share gain, new market and application successes and from new products. Overall, we expect to achieve double digit volume growth in fiscal 2008. For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we are targeting to prove our operating margins to about 13% next year. Healthcare should also show significant improvement over the next year. We continue to take actions to turn around volume in the U.S. business. We should also see continued growth in Europe. We are targeting to improve operating margin in this segment to 10% by the end of 2008. In our Chemicals segment, next year guidance includes both polymers and polyurethane intermediates results for the full year. For polyurethane intermediates, we have now completed the restructuring efforts we embarked on about a year and half ago. We have sold the Geismar facility and have reached a contract settlement with a major customer. We also explore the potential sale of the rest of our polyurethane intermediates business. Offers were inadequate and we planned to retain ownership. Regarding polymers, we remain on track with the progress we reported last quarter. And we hope to have an agreement of sale in place by calendar year-end. If this happens it would our intent to report our polymer emulsions business as discontinued operations once an agreement is in place and approved by our board. We also looking currently move the restructured polyurethane intermediates business into our tonnage segment. We have more to say about this next quarter. With regards to capital expenditures, our fiscal 2008 PP&A capital expenditures should be in the range of about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion reflecting a strong project workload. Our success in wining new business is driving CapEx spending higher relative to last year. Now turning to slide 16. Based on our quarter four 2007 results and taking into account that our fiscal Q1 has seasonal factors they tend to lower income in a few businesses, we expect first quarter earnings per share should be in the range of $1.08 to $1.13 for year-on-year growth of 5% to 10%. While there are many factors that will impact our walk from quarter four to quarter one, let me highlight a few of the factors that will influence next quarter's results. Factors we forecast increased earnings sequentially include, continued volume growth in Asia merchant gases and a seasonal rebound on our Europe merchant gases business. Continued pricing in our merchant gases broadly and improvement in both volume and cost in our global healthcare segment. Factors we forecasted decrease earnings sequentially include seasonally, we expect higher average cost in both our tonnage and merchant segments. Lower operating results in equipment and energy, following peak workloads in fiscal 2006 and 2007, seasonally lower volumes in performance materials and polymer emulsions, and a higher tax rate as we talked about earlier. All things considered, we expect to post a solid quarter to start our fiscal year 2008. In closing, 2008 should turn out to be another year of solid progress in delivering our results, improving our businesses, executing our strategies and making Air Products a great investment for our shareholders. We believe our steady record of growth and improvement over the past four years is evidenced by the results we have delivered, double digit sales growth, double digit earnings growth and a meaningful improvement in return on capital for all four years. We the employees of Air Products have a great deal to be proud of, sales in 2007 exceeded $10 billion for the first time. We generated net income of $1 billion and achieved the return on capital goal we've set in 2004. We also have proven to be good stewards of our shareholders money by investing wisely back in the business, making good use of debt capital available to us, increasing the dividend for the 25th straight year and continuing to buyback shares with the remaining cash. These facts are evidence of Air Products' underlying strength and excellent prospects for growth. Our people are focused on delivering today and continuing to deliver in the future. We're all excited about the opportunities the future holds as we continue to profitably grow by winning and executing on new projects, improving our margins by 300 basis points over the next three years by driving productivity, increasing plan efficiency and improving our business mix. Delivering increased value to our customers through technical solutions that address the markets and our customers' most urgent needs, and continuing to develop our people around the world to meet greater challenges. Our people represent the essence of the Air Products difference. They are the ones who create those shareholder and customer value. Thank you and now I turn the call over to Janelle to take your questions. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question today from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning P.J.
Nelson Squires - Director, Investor Relations: Hi P.J.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: You know you have a goal of raising operating margins by 100 basis points for the next three years.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: Can you achieve that with the current portfolio or do you need to exit chemicals and/or equipment business for that?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well certainly P.J. a factor in here is for us and the sell out polymers businesses as we talked about. The polyurethane intermediates business we're going to keep. It doesn't impact the... our goals for margin. As far as for other things that we have the margin improvement plans which we pretty much laid out for people to deliver on net margin improvement over the next three years.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: And then by selling HPPC, Paul, are you saying that the Ashland acquisition did not work out as well as you thought?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I am not, and we really, we had three products which we got, HPPC was one of them, but we also bought a strippers business in a... and we also bought a CMP cleans business. Those other two businesses were... and they were the reason for why we bought this business. We didn't ascribe a whole lot of value to the high period of processed chemicals, it was a decent portion of their sales, but if you just go back and look at the growth in which we have had and what we have been able to do in those businesses, the Ashland acquisition is still a good acquisition for our electronics business both now and in the future.
P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup: And just lastly Paul, are you disappointed with the pace of margin recovery in healthcare? Thank you.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly, we don't like the pace and we fell short of our goal this year which we already admit to. We've got a goal for next year and we are... we've taken the steps which we think are right to make it happen.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Thanks, good morning
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Bob.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: A couple of questions. First, Paul the merchant trends I guess, the monthly tranche provide show a little more strength through August. Did we see a deceleration in September and is there anything that gives you cause for concern.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As far as the trends in September, our September... it was not a strong on a year-on-year basis. We had a very good September last year though too, so lots of those gets in to taking and trying to compare to a particular month Bob, with it. Don't think you can... you got to be careful about that. We are seeing restrictions in both here in Europe and also in Asia on the helium thing. But argon and helium are very tight in North America and in Europe and that has restricted sales. For right now in sales growth year-on-year. Now the other thing which you've seen, you saw very strong price results there and so that I think has made up for that from a profit standpoint.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Got you and on the... Paul, you're seeing intermediates. Obviously you resolved your contract issue, which I would assume provides a nice near term financial incentive. But I suppose you'll be operating that unit at... at a lower utilization rate. So, one is that accurate in other couple of trends that you can shut one down and secondly how wide was the gap between the bid in offers there that you might be able to try and resuscitate a sale of that asset some time down the line?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well first in... and regarding the operating rates; we have gone through and made the changes in the plant to size the plant right to the size of the business which we have and so I think we're in good shape there. We also have added a few... we have also added an additional customer during this timeframe in this business. But this is the long-term contract type business and it has minimum surrounded and so as you go out and offer it wasn't as attractive to, let's say, private equity type of deals. It's not a huge business. It doesn't have any growth prospects really around it. But it does provide us a very steady ensure cash flow with that and so we made our decision to keep it because it was a good contributor to the Company.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: And I guess the logic was strategic buyer. One of your other main customers. Taking a look at that there was never discussed or just wasn't any interest there?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I am not going to talk about the... and the things which you, which we talk with our customers about. But certainly we try to explore as many avenues to look at the right place for this asset. And it turns out the right place I think is for us. We have the knowledge of how to run this plan, how to serve this market well. We are not going to invest back in this business. We are not going to build capacity in other places of the world. But I think we have a good asset here which makes good sense for us to run from a cash standpoint for us.
Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Bob.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Laurence.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: First of all, just to be clear on the outlook for 2008; is there a pension headwind in 2008 as well as the higher taxes?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes there is. Yes there is... I commented. You go to our footnotes. We said that the pension... the pension charge is about 30 to 35 in total. The way the accounting works for this, Laurence, is you can only record it at the time that you pay it. So we actually paid in $10 million of that this year and we will pay 20 to 25 next year. And that will be recorded at the time we pay it.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: And then --
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's included in the guidance.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: And then the maintenance spending for that hit tonnage this quarter that was about $5 million to $6 million?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes you are right.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: And finally, can you discuss the... as you're looking at the Electronics from SKU reduction a $100 million is that including the income HPPC divestiture or is that on top?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No. No it does not include the HPPC divestiture. The HPPC divestiture is treated as discontinued ops, so it is out of all of our sales. The SKU and these are different products which... these are products which we are buying and re-selling. In the market principally, until we've been taking actions with that and we notify our customers last year and we gave them like a 12 month notice. So they will be coming off that in this current year.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: And finally, what's your economist's confidence interval on the manufacturing assumptions for next year?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: On a confidence interval?
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: Yes.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: At last you know as far the way the economy is working out now I think we feel good about that.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company: Thank you.
Operator: And next we'll go to Jeffrey Zekauskas from JP Morgan.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Hi. Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Jeff.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: I've got a couple of questions about the chemical business.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: How did you double profits in the quarter year-over-year. I know your sales were up $30 million, but it just seems such a marked improvement. Are you sure you want to sell the business?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes we are. And part of the reason here is that there is impacts on pricing, there is impacts on customer mix here of who takes in this business. So that... and that does have an impact on us.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: So is the polymers business about 60% of the Chemicals segment. Is that the right order of magnitude?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The polymers business is roughly; probably may be that could to a little bit less. Probably it could be a little bit more Jeff. And probably little bit more.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And you accept that price?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: On revenue percent,
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: On a revenue percent and is its margin above the chemical average or below the chemical average ?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I am not going to break out the margins of the individual businesses there.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then lastly, on your balance sheet in your inventories and contracts and progress of 776 million, how much is inventories and how much is contracts in progress whatever that is?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Inventories for us runs about 525 to 550 in that and contracts and progress are there is the remaining portion.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: What is that ?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It pertains to on the equipment which we sell. So if I am selling you their equipment in... I sell it in my electronics business. I sell it in the equipment business there and what I do is as I build up the sale and if don't if I am not on percent completed or not I ever put the true sales yet and then its less the progress billings for that. So there are some things which go on a completely contract basis; some small sales there and so it goes in to inventory, which is what that is. If I get a progress billing that goes against it.
Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you very much.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure.
Operator: And Michael Judd from Greenwich Consultants has our next question.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question, I have a question about currency. For the first quarter any way do you have any thoughts on how that impacts the business... the various businesses here and you can talk about volumes also if you like?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. As far as currency is concerned I think further on if we look at Europe its already going to impact the European results favorably. What it does though from an economic standpoint, from a volume standpoint its going to depress the European business overtime because the higher cost... the higher value of the euro and pound, they are going to make the exports out of that area, harder an imports more attractive. Conversely helps us on U.S businesses as we have seen trade... the trade balance get better for the U.S.
Michael Judd - Greenwich Consultants: Thanks for the help.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure.
Operator: And David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank has our next question.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Thank you good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: How do you do?
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Paul, will the sale of polymers be dilutive to '08 guidance?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: By how much do you think?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Depending upon the timing of when that occurs and will have that, but it could be... I have gone through the share buyback etcetera and done a lot of that in advance, which is part of the offset to that dilution with things. But at the time at which we do this deal and we will give you the information at that point in time. I am not going to comment on the profitability rate at this point in time that polymers individually, David.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Okay understood. On equipment, are you going to lose money in equipment in 2008?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, I am not going to lose money equipment in 2008. It take $0.15 to $0.20 on equipment and energy, you can see what the impact is... that is, it does not take that segment to a loss.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Any if that $0.18 is here. Did you not?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The segment profits were around $100 million this year.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Okay, I will follow up later. And just one more thing on the six new plants in tonnage, what's the revenue and operating income impact in 2008 and 2009.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The six new plants in tonnage revenue... I mean which we would expect is our revenue growth for tonnage, this kind of be in line with the revenue growth for the Company. So somewhere in the 8% to 10% range for that time period.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: For all from those...
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You got to look at the loading impact too, we got loading impact and then the new plants. New plants are going to responsible for everything in there, we will have some loading impacts to that.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Is the tonnage plants, the largest of those six?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The other thing Dave on the tonnage thing and the Pemex plant as an example is not going to be accounted through per sales, it's going to an equity affiliate because we are doing a partnership with our partners in Mexico. And there is another facility which is also an equity affiliate too.
David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: And Mike Harrison with First Analysis has our next question.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Hi good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Mike.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: In your sales update you noted that tonnage gases were up 20% through July and August and then it came in at 12% for the quarter. I was just wondering if you could explain what was going on in September that you would see such a sharp decline there and then have you seen any continued slowing in tonnage there in so far in November... in October.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: What we had in tonnage last year is we had a plant come on stream in the last month, which pushed up the comparison period, as I said, you got to be careful about any particular one comparison at that point in time to because there are spot sales which go... which move around and don't occur every month, but that was the big impact which slowed us there.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Did the insurance settlement also hit in September?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The insurance settlement did not go through sales. The insurance settlement goes in other income.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Okay.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And so... but it did occur in the fourth quarter and obviously it was a big impact on margins of course, because didn't carry sales with it.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: Okay. And then you mentioned the... in U.S. healthcare you mentioned that you redefined the business model there, I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you are doing differently going forward there?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. And part of what we have done there in the business model is we have looked towards trying to take in focus our sales force on doctors as opposed to hospitals looking for a longer term patient with those things is that... that's an example of one thing. We have given them a new offering to go out and go to and the market within the respiratory end. We've taken our sales force and split it between the infusion and the oxygen portion of that, so we've made a lot of changes there. We're waiting to see the impact of those things.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: And then, I was just curious in the chemicals business, if you could talk about what you're seeing right now in terms of raw material cost impact. How that might have impacted the business in the quarter and what you're outlook is as you look into '08?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly, as far as on the raw material impact for us in chemicals and our polymers business, and we're being helped right now on a raw materials standby because we are VAM-based emulsion as opposed to an acrylic based... acrylic are being forced up by well. So we have... so that is helped us that helped our profits in our margin on a relative basis to an acrylic producer with that thing. On the polyurethane intermediates business that we actually pass through raw material cost there.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: And just really quickly on the Matheson helium JV. I was wondering if you could give me a sense of the incremental capacity that's going to be coming on stream in '09 relative to your existing helium capacity ?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Nelson might handle that.
Nelson Squires - Director, Investor Relations: It will led about 5% to 10% to our global capacity.
Michael Harrison - First Analysis: All right, thank you very much.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Operator: And Peter Butler of Glen Hill Investments has our next question.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Good morning. Wondering what is... what are your criteria for a stock split and a dividend increase?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well I am going to talk to... on the dividend increase first Peter, and regarding that is that we're going maintain our policy on dividends that to be within 30% to 40% of our earnings, and to pay that out, and so we don't see any change there. Regarding a stock split, I think I fail to see the value really in that force right not, it cost us money to do things, if we look at our holders and stuff like that I don't think its hurting our volumes and stuff like that or the liquidity to stock and so I can come up with the case to do it, I have a lot of holders who buy... they want to invest x number dollars in their products and buy up x number of shares.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Okay. Another subject in healthcare, are your Lehigh engineers experiencing insoluble problems here and therefore the best case now is may be there were just pretty it up enough so you can sell it ?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We do not think the problems are impossible here. We put in place a plan of action, it certainly is taking us a lot little longer than what we thought, but we remained committed towards making this business better.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Is selling it high... is that high on your option list of things to--
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The option right now which we're going at is we are going to make this business better. And we will make judgments as we see the market and the business get better and we will take a look at what our future is in that business at that point in time.
Peter Butler - Glen Hill Investments: Okay, thanks for the help.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: Mark Gulley with Soleil Securities. has our next question.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Good morning guys, I got three questions for you. First of all CapEx will be down a lot in fiscal 2008 versus 2007, can you provide some color there and is that one of the reasons that you have already announced that expenditure for this program?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As far as CapEx for PP&E it's up Mark. As you can see it was $1 billion roughly this year. We are taking the $1 billion, $2 billion for us. And the other factor we have is the acquisitions and so we had the Poland acquisition and we bought up the remainder of our business in Malaysia. And we continue to explore our opportunities there. As far as looking forward that and we have some of that crank into our plans and crank into the plans... and for the share buyback there. But... and we will see. The acquisitions depends upon the opportunities that you well know.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Yes, thanks for the clarification. Paul, you have provided some margin assumptions for '08 for couple of businesses but not all. Could you may be fill the inside straight there?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Certainly on the businesses which we have is... I'll just go the other ones which I didn't talk about. The equipment and the energy business it really it is not a margin business per se for us as you well know... the L&G and the air separation portion of that business have helped the margins differ by a lot. So we... it doesn't pay for us to really focus on the margins in there. With regard to tonnage business, in that business is actually a return business. It gets what you have as you have the impact of the energy flowing through there all the time, and so that distorts the margins. I will tell you on a constant energy basis what we're looking for and we're looking to increase the margins there in that business. So, may be half a basis point or so.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: And finally --
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I misspoke there Mark... 50 basis points or so and not half a point, sorry.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Okay. Thanks. And talking about the supply limitations in liquid helium, liquid argon both U.S. and Europe, is it possible to say what your volume growth would have been had you had adequate supply?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And that's hard. But I think it would have been in line with the growth we saw in manufacturing here, certainly helium, there's a lot of demand out there right now, but it's hard to say, how much I would have actually sold.
Mark Gulley - Soleil - Gulley & Associates: Thanks Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: And next one here from Don Carson with Merrill Lynch.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Yes. Nelson, I just want to clarify again on that merchant growth I mean if you... what was your actual LIN/LOX volume growth both in North America and Europe just trying to see whether in fact all this slowness was due to strains in argon and helium or what's going on with the underlying LIN/LOX trends ?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: In North America and Europe both around 3% both pretty solid year-on-year. So we didn't really see any surprise if you will in growth there.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Right, but I guess it is slowing somewhat. I know in the past people have shown some concerns over perhaps up to 4% capacity increases next year. Do you think that capacity will be able to be absorbed by the market. I am thinking of North America specifically in sort of 3% demand growth environment ?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We still believe that and there are a couple of reasons. I think every one is continuing to show good growth in volumes and one thing we did point out was our signings were very strong in North America this past fiscal year, significantly higher than our targets which were actually higher targets than they were a year ago. So we... a lot of that is going to come on line here in '08 and so I think that will continue to take up some of that capacity.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and just a question on costs. You talked about $0.12 of higher costs this quarter year-on-year, how much of that would have been in merchant and things like higher power and diesel fuel costs, what kind of constraint is that?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes Don, on fuel and on the power what that shows it shows up in the price and the raw material costs for us.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and then finally Paul your major ORONA target I didn't hear a new target in terms of return on invested capital and what your goals are there?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes and for you know and obviously our goals there is... and keep trying to drive that up, Don, as we invest and grow the business here. We... our target for this year for on return on invested capital is probably 13% to 13.5% in that range.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: And what about the several years. You think you can get up to the 15% range?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You know, if... yes I think that's possible in the future.
Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Yes, good morning thanks for taking my questions. With regard to your comments about the strength of Europe, really like that it come from Central Europe at least over the next year or two. Can you give us an update as to any kind of growth initiatives that you are doing in whole under this point, now you have got your feet on the ground for a couple of quarters here?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well I think... and the big thing is we are expanding a plant there already. We will announce that this quarter, and we will continue... we'll continue to look at that expansion in to that business.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. And then the maintenance issues that you had in the tonnage area. Was this just something that took longer than expected or is it just inflation in general and should we be expecting any of those costs to drag into the first quarter as well?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: What it actually is that we have a lot more plans on stream John and when you look on year-to-year basis, there will be a lot more plants and lot plant equipment, the maintenance cost are not at a line, they aren't unusual here, it's just the year-on-year increase which goes along with the volume of the business. So you have seen the volume of the business, on the hydrogen side grow by 35% to 40% over the past couple of years and what this reflects is the cost of going out and maintaining those units.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay, but it is my understanding that negatively impacted the margins year-over-year, though. Is that correct because the growth should have been there to offset that I would have thought?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We had volumes and the way in which we talked about, we said the volumes had a positive impact on margins and then we had the hurricane recovery which is actually negative but then the maintenance cost and so... but overall if I just take the, if I just take the impact of the hurricane recovery which was unusual, I would have seen margins grow on a year-on-year basis there.
John McNulty - Credit Suisse: Okay that's helpful, thanks a lot.
Operator: And next we'll hear from Kevin McCarthy from Banc of American Securities.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Good morning.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning Kevin.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: In Asia, how would you characterize the expected rate of capacity growth in the merchant business over the next one to two years?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well for us in Asia we... you know the growth rush LOX/LIN and the Merchant business has been in 20% range or so. I think the absolute percentage number is going to decline because the base is getting larger and larger. So I would say somewhere in the mid high teens.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Your liquid bulk volume accelerated to 18% on slide 9, I think it was 9% last quarter. Just trying to gauge whether volume growth is going to outpace supply growth over the next year. So in that region and what the implications for pricing might be because from time to time we hear about competitive intensity popping up in countries like China and India.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, and the thing which you ought to understand with that too, Kevin is that, it does depends upon the region in the country there. I mean Asia is very spread out so I can have the impacts in Korea or Taiwan or China, India etcetera for us. And so as we look at the manufacturing growth, we see very strong manufacturing. And we continue to see our investments blow quicker than what our assumptions are in the capital expenditure authorization. We've also been able to see that their pricing has is pretty good in the region. We've been able to recover increase in the power cost etcetera. And so and we're encouraged by the progress in the business. We're encouraged by the growth, we're encouraged by the pricing, we're encouraged by our investments there.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Okay and then. Shifting gears to tonnage, Paul I think you mentioned you're looking at 20 new tonnage opportunities. How would that number compare with say this time last year? Are you seeing any pattern of acceleration or deceleration there?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: It is certainly more. And they're getting a lot more real as we go through here and so we're encouraged by that.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: And finally, with regard to equipment and energy, when would you expect the backlog number to reach a bottom?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I would hope that the backlog number would start to pick up in mid 2008.
Kevin McCarthy - Banc of America Securities: Thank you Paul.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: And Mike Sison from KeyBanc has our next question.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Securities: Hey guys.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Hi Mike.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Securities: Can you give us a little bit of color just may be anecdotally where operating margins of electronics ended up for the year. I know your goal is sort to get to 15% or mid-teens if you will. Sort of what innings do you think we're at in terms of getting there?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I think if you look at the margins in the segment overall, we are making good progress there. You know I think we're on a steady path here to get the 15% margins by the 2009-2010 type time period in that segment. So... and we are close.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Securities: Okay. And then in European merchant margins, that's been an area working on to sort of improve. Are we getting close to where you want to be in that business as well?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: We have seen some improvement. What this really involves is taking cost out in those areas. So and we're still in the process of doing that as you can see and so as we continue to go out and deliver. But... and so we have seen some progress between our packaged gas and liquid bulk business this year, but we saw a more progress to get there.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Securities: Great and last question in healthcare as I recall it is basically just loading up that business increasing sales. What type of sales growth do you think you'll need to sort to get to that 10% by year end?
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You know the... as far as sales growth overall in the business certainly the markets growing 6% to 7% and so we looked at to go 6% or 7% or more in that business grab some share.
Michael Sison - KeyBanc Securities: All right, thank guys.
Paul E. Huck - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes.
Operator: And that does conclude our question and answer session for today. At this time I Mr. Squires I'll turn it back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Nelson Squires - Director, Investor Relations: Thanks Janelle. Please go to our website to access a replay of this call beginning at 2 PM today. Thank you for joining us and have a nice day.
Operator: And once again that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for joining and have a great day.
