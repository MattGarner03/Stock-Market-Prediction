===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call and Webcast. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Abby, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending our 2025 first quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's fourth quarter financial performance and 2025 outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and very good morning, everyone. Last quarter we took a fairly cautious view on the economy and unfortunately things mostly played out as anticipated. Yet despite those headwinds, Linde employees once again delivered resilient results by growing EPS by 8%, expanding operating margins 120 basis points to 30.1% and maintaining industry-leading ROC at 25.7%. It's during volatile and uncertain times like today when the Linde operating model truly stands out. To demonstrate that, Slide 3 provides an overview of the defensive nature of our business. Some of you may recall this slide. That is because we presented a version of it in April 2020, another period when financial markets were gripped with fear and uncertainty. Linde managed through a challenging 2020 and demonstrated its resiliency by growing EPS 12% that year and I fully expect this defensiveness to be on display for 2025 and beyond. Now we define defensive sales as businesses which contain at least one of the three categories. The first category represents resilient end markets that tend to be independent of economic trends such as healthcare, electronics or food and beverage. Over the last few decades, we have found these end markets to remain quite stable even during the most challenging periods, while also offering nice opportunities for growth throughout various economic cycles. The second category represents on-site customers from any end market who pay fixed facility fees that are independent of volumes. These fees are contractually required to recover out capital investment and are part of virtually every on-site agreement. This structure gives us significant earnings stability which has been proven during the most difficult times. And the final category relates to rental payments on our owned assets such as tanks, cylinders and equipment. Although the asset network requires upfront capital outlay, the contractual rental fees help recover the initial investment regardless of gas consumption. Individually, these categories have proven to provide resilient revenues and cash flow underpinned by a dense supply networks around the world, especially during times of economic stress. So the dark blue shading on the slide represents these three defensive categories which together account for almost two thirds of global gas sales. Additionally, this split is almost identical in every segment, further reinforcing the consistency of our business model in every geography, and this is ultimately validated by the chart on the right showing our 12% EPS compound annual growth rate over the last three decades. Overall, the model has proven itself and stood the test of time and I don't see that changing anytime soon. When looking at the current environment, we're seeing more negative than positive developments, so it may be helpful if I can provide some color on the first quarter trends by segment Starting in APAC, China trends have remained consistent when adjusting for seasonally weaker Q1. We are still seeing strength in battery and electronics, although rare gases and helium prices remained lower than prior year. Regarding the industrial end markets, we continue seeing softness across most, although our customers are primarily Tier 1 producers and thus have been much more stable. PAREA is mostly tied to the electronics sector and our largest customer there recently announced further expansion resulting in a new project Win for Linde. Australia has seen weaker manufacturing trends directly impacting packaged gas volumes, while India on the other hand remains one of the better growth regions globally. Moving to EMEA, we have not seen any meaningful improvement in industrial activity, despite some of the recent positive news regarding increased government spending. However, I'm encouraged by the more pragmatic discussions around decarbonization, which could help accelerate potential growth opportunities. Furthermore, we are very well positioned for any economic recovery or increased infrastructure spending. The Americas segment has been more of a mixed bag. On one hand, Canada and US Packaged gases are seeing some weakness from manufacturing uncertainty. On the other hand, US Bulk North Latin America volumes continue to grow low-to-mid-single digit percent Americas has the highest segment price increase at 3% reflecting the inflationary pressure we see in this segment. I fully expect us to stay ahead of any inflationary pressure through a combination of contractual pricing closes as well as our productivity programs. The quarter ended with a strong backlog of $10 billion of which more than $7 billion is sale of gas projects, all underpinned by long term contracts with secured returns driving future growth. You may recall from a prior earnings call that project contribution is part of our EPS growth algorithm and despite the uncertainty I expect we will continue to announce new wins in in the quarters ahead. In summary, the rapid changes in global trade policy are having a dampening effect on overall industrial activity. So I'd anticipate more volatility in end market trends until there is greater clarity and stability. And while no one could predict what will happen next week, let alone next quarter, I'm confident Linde will navigate the uncertainty by not only leveraging our operating rhythm to quickly adapt, but also continuing to deliver high quality growths. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results. Thanks Sanjeev. First quarter results can be found on Slide 4. Sales of $8.1 billion were flat to prior year and down 2% sequentially versus prior year. The foreign currency headwind was volatile starting at 4% but ending with 2% for an overall first quarter average of 3%. Cost pass through increased 1% from higher natural gas pricing but had minimal effect on profit. Net acquisitions contributed 1% primarily from packaged gas tuck ins in North America as we continue to see attractive roll up opportunities justified by cost synergies. Excluding these Items, underlying sales increased 1% from last year as higher pricing was partially offset by lower volumes. Pricing tracked with globally weighted inflation everywhere except for APAC which was impacted by lower prices in helium and rare gases. Volumes declined 1% as 2% lower base volumes were partially offset by contribution form the project backlog. As Sanjeev mentioned, industrial activity remains sluggish in most geographies and therefore has dragged down base volumes. Sequentially, underlying sales are down 1% as higher pricing is more than offset by lower volumes, especially in APAC, although we did experience weaker trends in certain packaged gas markets. Operating profit at $2.4 billion increased 4% and resulted in a margin of 30.1% or 120 basis points higher than prior year. All segments expanded operating margins as management actions in pricing and cost productivity more than compensated weaker base volumes. Despite the economic challenges, we expect management actions to continue to support profit growth and margin expansion. EPS of $3.95 was 5% over prior year or 8% when excluding the effects of currency translation. We finished the quarter at the top end of the guidance range due to slightly better FX as benefits from cost and pricing actions were mostly offset by weaker volume. Capex of $1.3 billion was equally split between base CapEx and project backlog. As a reminder, Linde has the most stringent project backlog definition in the industry which requires incremental growth underpinned by fixed fees and contract clauses to protect the overall return. Base CapEx includes all other growth investments not meeting our backlog definition, as well as maintenance and replacement spend. The 58% increase in project CapEx supports the record $7 billion sale of gas backlog. We're actively constructing the two largest projects in our history, so I anticipate elevated levels for a few more quarters. Conversely, base CapEx has declined from lower volumes and productivity actions. Slide 5 provides further details on quarterly Capital Management. The operating cash flow trend can be seen to the left, with the most recent quarter of $2.2 billion increasing 11% above last year. Note, the first half is weaker due to seasonality of cash payment timing for interest, taxes and incentives. For 2025, I anticipate a similar trend as last year. Disciplined capital allocation is a hallmark of lending culture, and the pie chart to the right demonstrates the balance across investing into the business and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we raised the annual dividend by 8%, representing 32 straight years of dividend growth with an average rate of 13%. We also repurchased $1.1 billion of stock while reinvesting almost $1.3 billion back into the business. The steady capital allocation model is underpinned by quality credit metrics and access to low cost funding as evidenced by our most recent 3% average bond coupon. In uncertain and volatile times like today, having a fortress balance sheet is critical for not only maintaining stability, but also capitalizing on growth and share repurchase opportunities as they arise. I'll wrap up with a guidance update on Slide 6. For the second quarter the EPS guidance range is $3.95 to $4.05. This represents 3% to 5% growth or 5% to 7% when excluding a 2% currency headwind. This range assumes recessionary conditions at the midpoint, translating to roughly 2% EPS headwind from lower volumes. Therefore, while the assumed FX headwind improved by 2%, we offset that benefit with an equivalent volume contraction at the midpoint. Consistent with our normal approach, this is merely an economic placeholder based on current trends. If things are better, we will perform better and if worse, we'll take actions to mitigate. However, it's important to note this range still follows our long-term EPS growth algorithm with double digit percent growth from capital allocation and management actions partially offset by the current unfavorable economic impact, including currency translation. The full year guide follows the same approach as Q2, resulting in an updated range of $16.20 to $16.50. FX improved by 2% but was offset by an equally negative volume assumption at the midpoint. All-in, we're holding the original guidance midpoint but are narrowing the range by a nickel on each end due to less remaining quarters. Overall, we believe it's prudent to remain guarded in this environment, but do not mistake our prudence for complacency. We continue to manage the things within our control by taking proactive actions and adhering to our long-term proven capital allocation strategy. Additionally, we're leveraging our secure balance sheet, engineering capabilities and unrivaled supply network to capture opportunities that will position us for the future. And eventually the economy will recover, at which point Linde will be well positioned to benefit with 2021 being the most recent example. Until that time investors can rest assured knowing that our employees will continue to exemplify the no excuses execution culture which has been the bedrock of our long-term compound value creation. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Michael Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning, team. Question as it relates to your backlog, Dow recently announced the delay of its Alberta project. Linde is a partner on that. Can you speak to what impact you expect that to have on your associated project, timing and startup, or what contingencies Linde has to protect itself there?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Mike. As you'd expect, most on-site contracts that we've had and continue to have build in contracted protection for events such as delays driven by customers. So this is not new. It typically happens. There is a typical grace period beyond which we have our invoicing that starts and the customer starts paying. So this is going to be no different in terms of the contractual protection that we have on the contract. Obviously having said that, we'll be working with Dow to look at alternatives and opportunities to see how we can help them meet their goals while maintaining Linde’s interest in the project.
Michael Leithead: Great, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning, this is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Thank you for taking my question. The EMEA margin performance was super robust in the quarter, and I think this is kind of coming collectively, even with your volumes down high single digits over the last few years. Can you kind of help us think a little bit about, like, what the margin profile could look like once volumes start to return eventually, at some point? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: So the EMEA margins have been, you know, are the result of some very hard work done over that by that team over a period of time. And I think making sure things that we control, pricing, productivity, get the attention that they deserve and are translated into results that reflect that margin number today. Obviously that's in the face of the volume kind of downside that you talked about. Our expectation is as volumes improve, those margins will continue to grow, which has been proven over time. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning, guys. It was two years ago, you guys rolled out the slide where you talked about $50 billion of opportunity around clean energy. You know, a lot of changes in the world as we're looking at that now. When you look at that market today, how would you, would you size it differently? Would you size the timing of it differently? What are customers coming back to you saying, how much trust do they have in pieces of the IRA? Some of the stuff that was driving that forward, because it was, you know, going to be a decent part of the algorithm for you guys to grow. Just, you know, get your view on kind of where that is today.
Sanjiv Lamba: So, Duffy, you're right. We kind of laid that out a couple of years ago when we laid out the strategy, we said, look, we'll decarbonize our own operations. We'll support our customer decarbonization process and of course, our new energy markets that will come through. We did offer that $50 billion over a period of 10 plus years, so there's a long time to go. As we reflect on that number, I think, you know, we see the opportunity set that we have around clean energy projects still looking fairly attractive. The feeder pool into that $50 billion looks still reasonable. I think what's more important is to focus on the slightly more shorter-term. And we said that, look, we expect $8 billion to $10 billion over the next few years. And I think the point to make over here, Duffy is that we are about halfway through there with the two projects that we're currently executing. And our expectation remains that some of those projects are likely to see additional trains in due course. And of course, other projects developing elsewhere in the Middle East and Europe could add to that tally. I'd say to you standing here, I still feel reasonably confident that $8 billion to $10 billion over three years is something that we still feel that we are set to get to. So that's kind of what the numbers look like. Just in terms of feedback and I think it's important to note over here, and you've heard me say this before, so at the point of I'm kind of belaboring the point over here a little bit, but we've always differentiated between two different types of projects, the low carbon hydrogen project, which is what is also known as blue hydrogen development, as well as renewable hydrogen or green hydrogen development. And you've heard me say in the past that green hydrogen development from my point of view, isn't at scale today, doesn't have the competitive cost base that is necessary or indeed requires to have significant reduction in capital intensity to get to that point of inflection. We've said in the past, and I maintain that that's probably five to seven years out. You'll be pleased to note that in our portfolio project that we're pursuing, that is a very small percentage related to renewable hydrogen and we only do that opportunistically when there is potentially a very low cost renewable access and so on and so forth. The primary development in our project pipeline is related to low carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen. And again, a lot of people reference IRA. I always want to remind folks that the clause that we should be talking about and thinking about is 45Q, which predates the IRA. And that clause is supporting producing hydrogen using natural gas, converting that using an auto thermal reformer or a steam methane reformer, and taking the carbon dioxide that is produced, capturing it and sequestering it, and hence that 45Q credit of $85 per ton, which we feel reasonably confident at this point in time. I think, I'm being brave in this world, but I feel confident that that has the support necessary as we move forward. And that's really what's underpinning the project development cycle that we're looking at. And that's where we feel the larger project development world that Linde is doing is concentrated on. And that looks pretty resilient as things stand.
Matthew White: And maybe Duffy. Just one thing I'll add to Sanjiv's as well is when you reference it on the algorithm. We've always said the capital allocation algorithm, we expect 4% to 6%. That's been our stable contribution going back a couple decades. And it absolutely includes projects like Sanjiv mentioned, and we feel good about that. But it also includes buybacks, it includes acquisitions, and it includes capital structure. These are all uses of capital. And you saw this quarter acquisitions now rounding up to 1%. We're seeing opportunities to do that. We continue to see buyback opportunities in the way the markets are reacting. So we have mechanisms and means to continue to contribute on that algorithm, even as some of these projects might be a little bit delayed or until they contribute. So we still feel good about our ability to deliver on that.
Duffy Fischer: Awesome. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. On your guidance, you lowered it by roughly $0.30 FX was the vast majority in the Americas due to weak manufacturing. If it was, which manufacturing end markets are you seeing the greatest slowing or demand weakness? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: So I'll let Matt talk about the guidance and I'll give you a flavor of what we're seeing in the U.S. Manufacturing. Matt?
Matthew White: Yes, sure. So I think, David, on the guidance, if you start with the FX change, as I mentioned, it was 4% in the beginning of the quarter, went to 2% by the end, averaged at 3%. Just as a reminder, when we put a guidance estimate, and it's merely an estimate into our range here, we take the forward rates at the beginning of each month. So what I'm telling you right now was the forward rate as of April 1st. We haven't updated that for today's forward rate, which we'll do. And then of course, we book the average rate as it occurs. Clearly the rates have moved a little bit, I would say, to a further weakening dollar. And when you think about what's moved the most, the euro has helped the most, given that seems to be more of a flight to quality currency today. The sterling's helped a bit. And then on Latam currencies, it's been a mixed bag, I'd say, between the peso and the real. So that's how we thought about that. And then clearly what you're seeing in this environment, normally when we'd see risk off, you'd see a strengthening dollar, which with a weakening environment, it's a bit inverted now, you're seeing a basically a weakening dollar with a weakening environment. So we are getting some offset in that and that's how we've laid it out. Time will tell, but like we said, if things are better, we'll do better. But I'll hand up Sanjiv to give more update on America's trends.
Sanjiv Lamba: So I'm going to focus on manufacturing, which I think was your question, David. So manufacturing in Q1 for the U.S. was softer than prior year. And that is a combination of factors, including the fact that we had a couple of weather events in both January and February, particularly in the south and southeast of the U.S. which obviously impacted that. We didn't end the quarter strong with a strong March, probably for the first time in many quarters, we saw some core manufacturing growth, both in gases and hard goods. In April, that trend appears to continue to be there. It's slightly moderated in the base of movement forward, but it's still intact. As I think about the industry that impacted that, when we look at it, we saw automotive, agricultural products, mining, et cetera, which were soft, not a surprise, offset in part by general fabrication, energy, chemicals and, of course construction. Now in April, also, I'd say, to you that the sentiment for the larger customers has turned more negative, obviously given the uncertainty and lack of stability in the market and potential for high inflation. So you can see that reflected in the PMI numbers that you've seen. So while sentiment has turned, we haven't seen that reflect in volumes just yet. And indeed some customers are still buying on the hard goods side, are actually making investments in larger CapEx items such as automation, which is kind of essential for productivity, particularly if you have labor shortages. So, I think overall I'd just say, that manufacturing has been more resilient than people had expected. Obviously the expectation remains that if you get some policy certainty, and if you get some stability, which have been creating some headwinds, you will see potentially in the second half of the year a likely pickup in manufacturing once those conditions are met.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Yes, good morning everyone. It's on the electronics, I think with the fourth quarter. Sanjiv, you were saying you're expected to sign new signatures very shortly. You signed something in Korea, with your relationship with Samsung, with an expansion. I'm just wondering, clearly other things are bubbling because that that side of the backlog actually in terms of value terms with startups diminished a little going into Q1. And then just a quick follow up, EMEA, I mean I always thought that should be the highest margin business you're delivering over 35% now. Is there anything exceptional helping that? Is it the volumes perhaps in the smaller on site business being a bit softer, giving it a little bit of a profit boost or is it just nothing extraordinary, it's just delivering on the model?
Sanjiv Lamba: So why don't I begin with EMEA, Peter, and just say that it is fundamentally the model. I don't think there is anything particularly offsetting. There's nothing special in there. It's the fundamental business that has turned from being a 19% margin business back in 2019 to being a 35% plus business today. And I think it's taken a lot of hard work to get there. I think credit to the team having worked through the energy crisis, the war in Ukraine and all of that to get us here. And I remain confident that that team really has the algorithm worked out and are executing it every day to make sure that they maintain that margin and move forward with it. Let me go back to backlog then and I'll talk about backlog generally. Then we talk a little bit about the Korean win. So in Q4, I did say, that you should expect us to announce some electronics projects. This is first of a few that I expect that we will be announcing the backlog overall, $10 billion plus, $7 billion of that is sitting in the sale of gas side, which is where most of the interest is. And my expectation is that this year, probably towards the second half of the year, we will start up about a $1 billion out of that backlog. The best thing that happens in a backlog, as I've always said, is, you start the projects up and it comes out of your backlog and your backlog shrinks. Now the good news is, I fully expect that we will end the year with a backlog with a seven handle on it. In fact, I expect it will be slightly higher than what we have today. So, I feel pretty good about the projects that we're currently developing. Despite everything you read in the news, we have a good pipeline of projects. I think Matt made the point really eloquently earlier on. Our algorithm says that our capital allocation will deliver 4% to 6% of the EPS growth and, feeding into that is high quality projects and much of those projects will come from our traditional end markets. There'll be some from clean energy, but much of the project development will actually come and the project wins will come from our traditional end market. So that's kind of what gives us confidence that the backlog is going to look pretty good. And the project win rate is looking particularly strong at this point in time, given the circumstances in which we are operating.
Peter Clark: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Hi, good morning. Actually, you just kind of answered what I had in mind, which was away from that [ph]. Have you seen any risk around delays or slowdowns on what is currently in the backlog? So startups that were due in Q2 that may be delayed to H2, for instance, or indeed lower to type from customers. But Sanjiv, as you just said that you are quite confident to find those projects. Can you talk about the areas where you see the biggest commitments, either geographically or in terms of end markets?
Sanjiv Lamba: Yes, and why not do two things? I'll just talk about how I'm seeing the markets for the rest of the year more broadly and then we talk about some of the investment trends that we're seeing as well. And Matt mentioned earlier on that from a guidance point of view, and you've seen this as well in the slides, we're considering recessionary conditions now at the midpoint. As I look around, when you think about end markets, resilient end markets are still going to grow. That's led by electronics, food and beverage, et cetera, low-to-mid single-digit. It's the more cyclical market. So the industrial sector, which is likely to see lower volumes towards the rest of the year, mainly in metals and chemicals. So that's kind of where you're thinking about from an end market perspective. As you look at geographically, we expect volumes in Americas to remain flattish for the year. That's kind of built into how we are thinking about the guidance. The resilient end markets obviously will continue to find their growth, but they will be more than offset by softer industrial sector, not dissimilar to what we saw last year. So, I think we'll kind of see that trend maintained. And America is flattish is how you should think about it. Europe there is unfortunately, as we've said before, no catalyst for change to the current trajectory. So we see continued softening in demand, mainly invest in Europe. Again, resilient end markets will continue to grow, but I expect that more than offsets that is more than offset by the industrial sector. Metals, manufacturing, chemicals, energy, all of them will see lower volumes versus prior year. So that's where I think most of the weakness will lie. In Asia, China is a mixed bag. I said that in my prepared remarks. I think as we look ahead, I'm not expecting any growth from China for the year. There are some green shoots, batteries, electronics, they are areas where you are seeing some growth. But metals and chemicals will continue to be weaker for the rest of the year. I also expect in Q2 in particular the export driven markets, manufacturing in particular will see continued softening given the tariff headwinds and the uncertainty that lies around that. The bright spark in Asia Pacific is India, and we obviously see continuing trend of investments and volume growth over there and we are obviously, as you know, well positioned to participate in that. South Korea, I mentioned the project that we've just won, which hopefully gives you a sense of how South Korea growth will look. Some growth this year, but obviously a lot of project activity continuing over there, which looks good. So if I summarized from an outlook perspective, which is then reflected back into our guidance, America's flattish APAC largely balanced despite the headwinds in China and Europe or EMEA really where you'll see weakening volumes kind of reflecting in that outlook that we, that we presented. Now against this backdrop as we think about CapEx, it is the secular growth opportunities that are particularly driving the CapEx growth for us. So electronics will play a big part in that. But alongside that there are wins happening geographically in Asia in particular, which are more metals, chemicals, these are smaller wins, but notwithstanding, they kind of add to the overall portfolio wins we're looking at. So we will see some clean energy projects, but we are going to see a lot of electronics projects. We're going to see some metals, we're going to see some refining, even some chemicals projects come through in other parts of the world and I think that's what will create the balance to get us to that backlog that I referenced earlier on.
Laurent Favre: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I have a couple of questions around your income statement. In 2024 your other income was $200 million, sort of a positive change of about $234 million. And normally that number is pretty low. What's your expectation for 2025? And secondly in your SG&A expense, I think was down 9% from $860 million to $786 [ph] million [ph]. How did you do that? Is there something unusual in that number? And if your SG&A was flat, roughly your operating profits would have been flat in the quarter. So can you talk about the different pressures that your income statement seems to be under and how you're coping with that? Is your SG&A going to be down 9% for the year or was the first quarter unusual?
Sanjiv Lamba: Jeff, I'm going to let Matt, who's looking forward to responding to you on these questions, respond back, but I'm just going to touch on SG&A tell you this very briefly. It takes a lot of hard work and management actions and as you know, last year in the third quarter we took the restructuring charge that's all being executed as we speak and that obviously is reflected in the SG&A line in addition to the fact that we have lower incentive compensation that's sitting in there as well, which obviously gets normalized over time. But I'm sure Matt will have a far more elegant response to that. Matt?
Matthew White: So let's start with other income. First what's in it, right. Probably is a good way to start and other income for us, what we put there is either large items extraordinary either gain or loss that we feel are operating related obviously, but either are large enough we carve out or could be based on a prior timing. So last year about a quarter of that number, you may recall, was a large insurance claim that we had. We actually spiked that out in Q1. In fact, when you look at the Q1 year over year you see a fairly large drop in other income going from almost around $60 million to $20 million. So that actually was a large insurance. Now clearly we had losses prior to that and going forward on that because it included a BI element. So to some extent you have a little bit of a timing mismatch because of the claim you got in insurance against the backdrop of some ongoing BI impact from that incident that occurred. And that was actually in the other segment you may recall on our materials business. Outside of that there are going to be some gains and losses on certain sales, but we also did have some other offsetting items actually above other income that we had talked about in the past as well. Now, we don't give a projection on that number, but I fully don't expect 2025 to be near that level. In fact, you already saw it in the first quarter as I mentioned, we're already down $40 million. So I think 2025 will be more representative of 2023 or prior years as whereas we didn't have such a large insurance benefit or some of the other items that occurred in 2024. As far as SG&A, we'll start with about a quarter that's currency. Okay. So obviously we talk about the FX hurt on op, but in SG&A we equally have costs that are foreign denominated, so you get that benefit. But even outside of the FX, we did take a restructuring charge in Q4, as you know, we need to see the benefits of that. And those benefits primarily manifest themselves in lower headcount and lower SG&A spend. So there is the benefits, the productivity associated with that. Right now my expectation is the actions we've taken for the most part have offset any normal growth in merit or SG&A. But on top of that, we did have a fairly sizable year-on-year reduction of incentive comp. We are a pay for performance culture and we're not performing. We understand that we're not meeting our targets and therefore the incentive comp is lower. So I expect it could remain lower for the remainder of the year. It will probably be a little lumpier because it's a function of the projections and the forecast of the payout ratios. But I fully expect lower compensation payout this year than prior year and that'll be reflected in the accruals because our shareholders also are suffering through this. So we need to as well.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Stephen Byrne: Yes, thank you. Matt, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you attributed productivity and pricing as the drivers of that 120 basis point operating margin improvement year-over-year that more than offset lower volumes and, a little bit of the cost increase. Pardon me. And my question for you is, can you size those two buckets? The productivity and pricing, how would you size those two to drive that margin expansion? And maybe more specifically on productivity, what all are you doing these days on driving that? Historically, headcount reduction was a big lever for you guys. But moving forward, do you still see that as a meaningful opportunity and any changes in your approach at achieving that productivity gain?
Sanjiv Lamba: Yes, sure, Steve. So we'll start with how to size it. So I think an easy way to think about this is going back to the earnings algorithm. And as you recall, we give three pillars, capital allocation, which we say is 4% to 6%, management actions, which is at least another 4% to 6% if not more. And then the macro which is base volumes and FX. Management actions represents price less cost and the productivity. We always think about that as a spread, so you – each one in an individual is not as important as the spread. So while price is important and while cost is important, the spread between the two is the most important. So as long as you achieve positive spreads in all of your geographies that will be 100% contribution towards margins. It is purely margin accretive in that regard. And the management actions over our prior two to three decades of EPS growth has consistently contributed probably close to two-thirds of our EPS growth in the algorithm. And so when you think about more than half of your growth coming from that area, that by default will result in a margin accretion aspect. Now I will say in tougher times, and arguably we're in a little bit of a tougher time right now, you're going to see larger margin expansion because the management actions as a percentage of the whole algorithm is greater. And then when you see recovery times, and I mentioned 2021 where we grew EPS 30%, when you see recovery times, then the margin may not expand as much as you normally would see it because macro becomes a much bigger driver, you will get margin expansion, just not at the same level you might with a management action. So I think from that, and that's how we think about it as far as productivity initiatives, clearly you're going to have technology advancements will always give us opportunities, AI being the current version. But there's always going to be developments that give us opportunity to do more. And I would never underestimate that. As the world changes, new opportunities create themselves. When you see even areas where you might have some slowdowns, we will look at new ways of how we do our distributions, how we source our product. It's always a discussion of fixed versus variable cost and what's the appropriate way to address a market for the time we see it operating in a certain capacity. And by doing that we can find synergies by increasing or decreasing the operating leverage of the business by either extending more variable costs or by reducing variable and going fixed costs for greater recovery. So it is always a continuous effort, it's always evolving. There's never an end game. That's why we never name our programs. It's integrated with the culture. And so from that end, it's not one silver bullet. If there was, then I probably wouldn't believe it. It's a lot of things.
Matthew White: And to that point, Steve, let me just give you a bit of color. There is no one silver bullet and we are grateful for that because we want every part of our business engaged in productivity effort every day. Last year we did 15,515 projects. This year in the first quarter we've done more than 4,000 projects. More than 4,000 projects. It takes every part of the organization to look at the opportunity every day and make sure that that gets happened. Not only does it get executed, it's actually then recorded and the learnings are then cascaded to the rest of the world. I'll give you a couple of quick examples just to illustrate how practically we're looking at productivity. So obviously ASU operations are very power intensive. As, we are one of the largest purchases of power globally. Optimizing that even by a small percentage has a big impact. So we have a power optimizer model that is currently using AI to optimize the way we operate our plants. Depending on the level of customers’ demand, on the tank level that we have, the tank level our liquid customers have and the power pricing that's going to happen from a predictive point of view, there's a good example of something which we perfected over many years now being, kind of having its biggest impact because we're able to do it real time using an AI model. Two other big examples. The other one would be distribution. One of the things that, we are doing is deploying telemetry so that we understand exactly the tank levels that exist within our customers’ tankage and our ability to then distribute and schedule that distribution load in a way that further optimizes and creates efficiency on the use of the asset as well as ensures that we are getting to the point where the customers at a load level that we think is appropriate for us to refill. So again, a lot of sophisticated machine learning models sitting behind that, which track the telemetry track the usage of the customer typically has and based on that do predictive scheduling. Those are two examples. I mean we have 105 use cases on AI models that we are deploying as we speak. So there is a lot of opportunity around this. I'm excited about a third. Well, about 30%, 31%, 32% of our, all our productivity efforts come out of digital and AI solutions.
Unidentified Analyst: Very good, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Hey, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on your 2025 outlook. When you think about sort of economic contraction, does your volumes were down 1% in Q1, does it, should it stay around that level or does it get a little bit worse as the year unfolds? And then longer term? Sanjeev it's been pretty unusual downturn for industrial demand. What do you think? What are you looking for? To maybe see a green shoot or so longer term?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Matt, why don't you talk about the 2025 outlook in terms of the guidance that we provided?
Matthew White: Yes, I think Mike, I'd say let's start with not much different than how we normally approach it. So when you think about every 1% of base volume assumption, roughly 2% EPS impact, give or take maybe 1.5% depends on the margin profile of the business. And so within that context we still feel very confident around the backlog contribution. So that 1% we have will continue throughout the year positive and then it's really just a function of the base assumption. And so we put a placeholder in there today, 2% negative EPS contraction which represent about 1% to 1.5% top line negative base volume and we'll see. I mean, what I want to reiterate, consistent with prior times, this is not our economic call per se, it's just the placeholder taking kind of the current situation and extrapolating it out. We're going to take actions to mitigate, we're going to take actions to work around it and time will tell what actually happens. So that's really how we did it. I'd say nothing really different than that.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Matt. So on the industrial long term development, Mike, it's difficult to predict next week so you're asking me to look a lot longer than that. I'll tell you a different way to think about the industrial growth as we go forward. Obviously, we've talked about industrial recession for some time now and your comments kind of illustrate that as you think about the long-term trends I'd say to you need to be looking at maybe three or four different elements that are going to drive that. The first secular growth we've said before, things like end markets like electronics. Given AI data center growth, there is a direct correlation to what you see around semiconductor growth underpinning the electronics end market that we have and I think you should expect to see that growth continue. In fact, I said earlier on today in my comments on the backlog that I expect that we will continue to see that reflecting the recent win with Samsung, but hopefully others as well as we move forward. So there'll be secular growth drivers like that that will continue to be an exciting part of the growth algorithm underpinning any industrial recovery that we see longer term. The other piece that I think is worth mentioning is there are high growth markets around the world where we have obviously a very strong footprint, being in 81 countries is an advantage in the sense that we are well positioned in the market that we expect to see either as a result of some of the arbitrage coming out of the tariff developments or as a result of just locally driven consumption driving growth in markets. So markets like India, which we kind of mentioned a couple of times, a bright spark as far as growth is concerned. Obviously, we still expect Mexico, Indonesia and other markets like that to continue to have a growth trajectory that'll hopefully help the overall industrial recovery piece, last but not least is new growth markets. These are nascent. You don't hear us talk too much about it. But examples of aerospace, where we are seeing significant growth and expect to see continued growth in that sector, I think is an area that will continue to gain in size and scale. And as it does, it'll actually support the elements of growth that we talk about longer term. Longer term. I'll also say to you that, quantum computing is another trend that we expect will, will have an opportunity, it does need to mature. It is still, nascent technology, but as it matures and scales up, the fact that quantum computing requires cryogenic cooling is an exciting opportunity from a Linde perspective. We have some great proprietary technology around that and we're excited to see what happens in that space. Even today we are providing some cryogenic cooling technologies even for the pilots that are happening around the world. So I see that as another example of a new growth market that we'll continue to pursue. Those will really drive that industrial recovery, obviously underpinned by a recovery in the normal cyclical cycle that you'll see for most industries. That'll obviously come back. That's always been the case and we fully expect that obviously a bit of stability around trade rules and so on and so forth will kind of accelerate that recovery as it happens.
Michael Sison: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Patrick Cunningham:
Linde:
Sanjiv Lamba: So as, we've, let's talk about health care broadly and I'll break it up into two parts. Obviously we have a very strong hospital care business, that has got a steady growth rate, continues to be in low to mid-single digits and we see that across the world and obviously post-COVID there's been a greater appreciation of the need for setting up the infrastructure. And so therefore, some of the, even on the equipment side we see some, some potential continues to help with that infrastructure build out. So I expect to see that that growth continues to be stable, steady and continue going forward. The home care business obviously in the U.S. attracts a lot of attention and we have been trimming that portfolio as you're aware. And we are leveraging technology today to try and make sure that that business becomes more efficient, reduces the amount of paper that is there, digitizing a lot of processes, et cetera. That's where I think the thrust of our effort in Linde continues to be. It's a business that has to be focused on improving service levels and making sure that we are working on productivity every day. And as part of that we will continue to look at our portfolio and whatever we need to do, we continue to do. This isn't a one off exercise. We look at our portfolio all the time across all our businesses and the home care business is no different to that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning, thanks for taking my question. So the U.S. has seen some on-shoring already. You guys have been a decent beneficiary on like the electronics front and semiconductor side with while the tariff situation doesn't seem quite settled at this point yet, if the U.S. continues this kind of protectionist mode, do you see other opportunities in some of your other businesses where you might see outsized growth, whether it's tied to, there's some expectations for maybe aluminum and steel picking up in the U.S. relative to other regions, that kind of thing I guess. Can you help us to think about maybe some of the good guys around some of the tariff discussion versus all the bad guys we've been hearing about for the past few weeks?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, I think the tariff discussion sometimes becomes one sided where people are only looking at the risks around that. I think to your point, as the tariffs play out and as they stabilize, people will make decisions around reshoring on-shoring back again and I think that's where you will see some movement. I will tell you in the short-term there isn't any development today that I can point to other than electronics, where that has a substantive Impact. But do we hear conversations and are we being people reaching out to us and, and having conversations around the potential of setting up new capacities in the U.S. yes, we certainly are seeing some of that happen. So my expectation remains that as the conversations around tariffs stabilizes, we will see more growth. I mean, the administration describes it as an industrial resurgence in the U.S. even if that happens in part, it'll still be a very attractive opportunity for us, just given our density across the U.S. and our presence. We feel really good about the fact that as and when that on-shoring, reshoring process takes off, we will be well positioned to participate in that and see some growth in that. I'm not going to speculate on the sectors or end markets where we're going to see most of that, but clearly electronics already in play. As, we want and build the Phoenix supply to the Phoenix Fab for TSMC. We are building, at Taylor Texas for Samsung. We're also, building with other, for other players in the U.S. So we certainly see that growth potential on the electronic side. For the others, whether it's aluminum, steel, batteries and so on and so forth, I think there'll be a number of end markets that the potential for on-shoring will look attractive, but we'll have to wait and see how that develops.
John McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the caller.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. Nice results. If general inflation picks up, do you think your pricing would accelerate or because of the weak macroeconomic backdrop here, we might get a disconnect between inflation and your pricing.
Sanjiv Lamba: Inflation is, we are an inflation play, as you've heard us say before, we like inflation. It allows us to move the pricing forward and absolutely, as we've said many times in the past, a good proxy for our pricing is globally weighted CPI. So as it picks up, there's an opportunity for us to continue to price that. There is no divergence to that model. We've done that over 25 years. We expect to continue to do that.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Thank you and good morning, Sanjiv. From my perspective, Linde's had a very accurate and appropriately cautious view of China in recent years. So I'd be very interested to hear your updated thoughts on the near term, what you're seeing and hearing from your customers in April and May across end markets. And then in terms of let's say medium term planning for China, how much runway do you see on productivity in that country? Specifically trying to counterbalance macro risk versus cost help in your algorithm within China.
Sanjiv Lamba: So Kevin, given where we are today, it's probably easier to speak about the medium term than the near term. But I'm going to address both. I'm going to address both. Now let's start with the medium term to begin with and I've said this a couple of times, I think it's worth repeating it. The days of 8%, 7%, 8% 10% growth in China are longer and we are looking our medium term view of China growth is it will be moderated to low single digit from an IP perspective. I'm not going to comment on GDP. IP is where we follow. Maybe low to medium single digit is the best we will expect to see out of China medium term in terms of growth. Our efforts in China over the last couple of years now as you would normally expect, we will front run these efforts. We saw the development in China a couple of years ago and said we are treating our Chinese business as a mature business and therefore we expect them to take all the actions we would expect from a mature geography anywhere else in the world, which means pricing, productivity, automation, offshoring, non-value-added activities and so on and so forth. And I think I still see a fair amount of productivity opportunities sitting in the Chinese business. Also, given that they are leading in many ways around the AIP, that we are actually seeing the AI led use cases for China being quite attractive. I think we gave an example and one may have shown this video at one stage where we are rolling out our smart plant operations where we're using drones and robots to actually do a lot of the normal work that we would do on an air separation unit, doing readings, looking at pressure gauges, looking at temperature gauges and making sure that that information is filtered into an AI program that then provides alerts and allows human intervention to take place. Obviously, that then results in being more productive at that particular site. In a couple of provinces in China we've been able to get approval to reduce the amount of manning on the site as a result of that. So there's an example for you of a program that we are now rolling out to entire business in China which will cover a large number of plants for us, giving us benefits coming out of productivity. So expect strong productivity benefits from China to continue and that's kind of where that business stands. On the near term let me just, I'm just back from China about four weeks ago. I'm headed there in two weeks time and that's largely spending time with our customers, speaking to my CEO counterparts to understand how they are looking at the market and I'll give you a quick view on how. I'm just going to give you Q2 as an example to what we're seeing in terms of outlook, which will I think hold for most of the year. So steel was very weak metals generally and steel specifically was weak in the first quarter. We expect a mild recovery over there because there were a couple of turnarounds that happened in steel. But broadly steel for the year will continue to be lower than previous year. I think the metals market are reflective of the general industrial lower or declining industrial activity set as far as chemicals are concerned we are also expecting chemicals to continue to be a little bit softer and I think that trend is likely to hold for the rest of the year as well and in fact probably beyond that. So there's nothing to suggest in either of those end markets you will see anything different. The areas of growth the green shoots are on battery and EV development. You read about it in the press. I visited the BYD facilities four weeks ago, spent time with the Chairman, spoke about their vision and they have a fairly significant plan in terms of continuing to grow that base that they've built up on EVs. About 40% of all EVs in China, 40% of all cars in China are today EVs and the expectation is that number will continue to grow. There's an example of, some development of green shoots around EVs and batteries. The other piece I think that I think is also growing at a reasonably fast pace is electronics. The government has a stated intent of becoming more self-reliant and it is ensuring that there is incentive available for electronics companies to continue to expand and grow. Obviously they don't go to the advanced nodes that you see with TSMC or Samsung or others. But nonetheless, just in terms of the amount of chips being manufactured in China today, the expectation remains that you'll see a lot of growth there. The areas where I see the greatest stress in the near term are going to be the merchant and packaged business, which are really correlated directly to manufacturing and the fact that we have punitive tariffs in place that are going to upend that manufacturing process over there. You should expect weak demand. I think there will be industrial deflation that are likely to continue in that space and really I think there will be pressure at least in the second quarter. Potentially a little bit beyond that, as you think about that space around general manufacturing. That kind of, I think, is where things stand with China today. Do not expect, and we have not built in and we do not expect any recovery in China this year.
Kevin McCarthy: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.
Josh Spector: Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in, Sanjiv. I wanted to follow-up on one of your early comments in the prepared remarks, you talked about Europe and a more pragmatic decarbonization approach and leading to some encouraging conversations. So I just want to see if you could translate what that means for Linde. Where does that add opportunity for you? Is that preference projects? Is that demand or what does that mean? Thanks.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Josh. So I think the simple answer to that is Europe has struggled with regulatory frameworks being led by ideology rather than pragmatism. And I think for the first time, not for the first time, we worked hard at this over the last 18 months to get a general appreciation that low carbon hydrogen, has a very important role to play as people think about decarbonization in Europe, because that's the only way you're going to get a cost competitive, a cost competitive solution for decarbonization of large industries which have substantive CO2 or greenhouse gas emissions. And I think that's probably where my commentary earlier on my prepared remarks was, reflecting on growing conversations and potential for regulatory change that will accept carbon capture sequestration as an acceptable solution supporting low carbon hydrogen growth. A specific example of that would be, you're aware that we have signed a project development agreement with Equinor for the development of low carbon hydrogen projects in Europe, and that would be a direct beneficiary if the regulatory framework was to move forward. We still have to wait for that to happen, but we do see greater pragmatism and certainly an openness to understanding the benefits and understanding the science behind the conversations we're having. Obviously, in the U.S. low carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen has a significant potential because of the support coming from the government through the 45Q [ph] elements, but also because the natural gas pricing and availability underpins that growth.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Juan Pelaez for closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you, everyone, for attending today's call. I wish you all a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. And I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Abby, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending our 2024 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's fourth quarter financial performance and 2025 outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Looking back, 2024 was another successful year for the Linde organization. I'd like to personally thank the 65,000-plus employees for their relentless drive to deliver shareholder value while they live our core values every day. This isn't something that happens overnight. Or can it be copied or indeed driven top-down from a handful of individuals. Rather, it is a result stemming from decades long culture, mindset and operating growth. And it can best be exemplified by the results shown on Slide 3. From my perspective, there are four key categories that Linde must excel at, day in day out, to maintain our long-term industry-leading position. Of course, we must deliver on our key financial metrics and remain responsible stewards of our owners' capital. That's a given. But we have a sustainable leadership position for that and the long term, that requires continued investment in our people and surrounding communities, as well as doing our path to help improve the environment. Finally, we must position ourselves for the future to ensure resilient and continuous growth and improvement. We can never be complacent based on past performance. I want to start with our people and communities, because Linde's success has always been, and always will be, attributed to our employees' ownership mentality and collective efforts. We continuously strive to be good corporate citizens in thousands of communities where we live and work. Also having a safe and diverse [indiscernible] is a top priority in order to ensure Linde's competitiveness for many years to come. And you can see the improvements we've made from an already leading position. More work is to be done, and I fully expect to leverage technology in that effort, but I am pleased to see the progress made to date. While people and communities are a priority, efforts towards ensuring a sustainable environment are becoming more challenging every day. I think it's fair to say we're seeing more extreme weather now than in prior years. And here at Linde, we will continue to do our part to help the environment, through an increased focus on low carbon power, Linde increased its active low carbon and renewable energy consumption by 19% year-over-year. In 2024, over 40% of our total power consumption is now low carbon based. These are just a few of the many accomplishments, and I want to encourage you to read our annual report for many more. Furthermore, it is rewarding to see our sustainability efforts being recognized by some of the most prestigious names such as the Dow Jones, which included Linde in its sustainability world index for the 22nd consecutive year. In addition, we've pride ourselves in helping our customers, avoiding more than 2x our CO2 emissions through the use of our products and services. But there is much more work ahead to achieve our ambitious sustainability goals, including reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2035. Turning to financial performance. Linde once again led the industry across key metrics. 25.9% ROC. EBIT margins increased 190 basis points to 29.5%. EPS increasing 10% as FX and $7 billion of capital returned to shareholders from the significant excess free cash flow. These are the best metrics in the industry, some by a wide margin. This provides us with a source of pride and ownership, but we also recognize this is the past. Valuations are derived from a combination of past performance and future expectations. So we must continuously position ourselves for future growth, regardless of the macroeconomic conditions. Positioning for future staff with a concise strategy and a capital allocation policy. At Linde, we know that the investments we make, and the ones we avoid are equally important, because mistakes in this industry can have long-lasting consequences. This is why sticking to our core business while maintaining disciplined contract terms is critical to building safe, reliable and profitable supply infrastructure. The year ended with more than $10 billion in backlog, including a record sale of gas backlog of $7 billion. Included in this is a $2-plus billion to [indiscernible] win in Canada which is a great example of a high-quality project in a core geography. This project normally has fixed payment structure with predicted returns that materially improves our local supply density in a fast-growing vision for clean energy. I fully expect to be announcing new projects and customers in the near future. But growing in industrial gases in more than just mega projects. We have to continue keeping our eye on smaller opportunities as well ensuring that they add attractive annuity-like growth. During 2024, we once again set a record for small on-site wins, signing 59 long-term agreements for a total of 64 plants, all of which will increase reliability and strengthen our network density. Acquisitions of small tuck-in packaged gas opportunities also remain an important part of synergized growth with 18 signed transactions, with annualized revenues of approximately $200 million. All in, 2024 was another successful year despite the many challenges. That being said, it's time to move forward and look ahead. All of you have seen the new earnings guidance for 2025, and therefore, I believe it's important to reiterate the components of our long-standing EPS growth algorithm on Slide 4. For many years now, we've defined our EPS growth into 3 categories, of which both capital allocation and management actions are within our control. And the economy is not. Capital allocation represents contributions from a long-standing and stable capital management policy. The main elements include our contractual project backlog, share repurchases, small bolt-on acquisitions and capital structure efficiencies, generally achieved through interest and tax management. It's important to note that our backlog definition is unique in industry as it only includes incremental growth from contractually committed customers with fixed payment elements and termination provisions to ensure a minimum return on capital. While no other company follows the strict interpretation, it certainly provides [indiscernible] greater certainty of backlog EPS contribution in any environment. Similarly, the majority of acquisitions are justified on cost synergies only and therefore, provide a high degree of confidence on capital return and thus EPS generation. Finally, share repurchases offer an attractive and flexible use of excess free cash flow, as project start-up and acquisition cadence were ebb and flow, enabling a highly consistent EPS contribution from overall capital allocation. All of these elements have historically contributed 4% to 6% EPS growth, and I feel confident this will continue for the years to come. Management actions represent the daily self-help initiatives our employees undertake to ensure growth regardless of the macro climate. Digital solutions and AI are increasingly supporting productivity, price and cost management, which are controllable initiatives deeply embedded into a culture and operating rhythm. And which allow us to grow earnings regardless of the economy. History has proven for these to be the largest compound value generators as they are not directly correlated to overall economic activity. This combination of capital allocation and management actions is expected to deliver 10-plus percent EPS growth each year with margin expansion, and 2025 is no exception. The pre or post merger, these two components have been the dominant drivers of our long-term double-digit EPS growth CAGR. While I remain confident in our ability to deliver on this 10%, we are constantly striving to find more opportunities to improve. Conversely, we cannot control the third category, which represents macroeconomic factors. For Linde, these are 2 factors that matter the most. Foreign exchange rates and industrial production as a proxy for base volume trends. Recall that we are a U.S. dollar-functional company with approximately 2/3 of earnings denominated in foreign currencies and thus exposed to FX translation. Similarly, while our customers are often under long-term contracts with fixed facility fees, the incremental gas to consume is a function of their own production rates, which typically highly correlates to industrial demand. Hence, why Global IP is a generic proxy for our customer gas consumption of base volumes. The current 2025 guidance range assumes a 4% FX translation headwind, while the midpoint of the range assumes 0% IP growth environment. Overall, it's clear that the growth algorithm is well intact, but we have our work cut out regarding unfavorable FX translation. This does not come as a surprise, as you may recall from our statements last quarter, and subsequent self-help actions that we initiated. Furthermore, we will continue to identify and execute additional management actions to mitigate macro weakness. Eventually, these economic headwinds will convert to tailwinds, as they always do. And until then, you can be rest assured that the [indiscernible] the organization will be focused on creating shareholder value and maintaining our long-term industry leadership, no matter the environment. I'll turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.
Matthew White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Fourth quarter results can be found on Slide 5. Sales of $8.3 billion are flat to prior year and down 1% sequentially. For both the prior year and sequential comparisons, foreign currency translation was a 2% headwind. Excluding FX and cost pass-through, underlying sales grew 2% versus last year and were flat from the third quarter. Price increases of 2% over 2023 and 1% sequentially continue to track with globally weighted inflation. The volume growth was flat as contribution from the project backlog in the Americas and APAC offset lower base volumes in EMEA. The sequential volume decline is primarily attributed to softer EMEA metals and mining volumes and seasonality factors in APAC. In general, economic trends mostly followed our prior guidance, although the FX impact was worse than expected from a significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar toward the back half of the fourth quarter. Operating profit of $2.5 billion grew 9% and resulted in a 29.9% margin, primarily from management actions around price, cost and productivity. EPS, $3.97 grew 11%, or 13% excluding FX. The 9% CapEx increase is entirely driven by contractual projects, as base CapEx decreased from a combination of currency, productivity and lower base volumes. I anticipate this trend to continue as we execute on the record $7 billion sale of gas backlog to support future growth. Further details on capital management can be found on Slide 6. Full year operating cash flow ended at $9.4 billion, with almost 60% occurring in the second half. As mentioned in prior calls, I expect this split to remain due to seasonality of specific cash outflows, including incentive payments, taxes and interest. The pie chart on the right shows the full year capital allocation. We invested $5 billion back into the business, with half underpinned by secured high-quality growth opportunities. And we returned $7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Returning this amount of capital to our owners year after year requires a disciplined capital allocation policy and a very healthy balance sheet. Two things that are much easier said than done. I'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 7. We're initiating full year EPS guidance of $16.15 to $16.55, representing 4% to 7% growth or 8% to 11% when excluding an estimated 4% currency headwind. As mentioned earlier, the 4% impact is from the accounting translation of foreign earnings, which experienced a rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar towards the end of 2024. Recall this is merely a projection as we're required to book the actual months average rate to the income statement. The methodology used for this estimate is consistent with prior practice by using the forward curves on a weighted basis for each foreign currency at the start of the month. Historically, large currency devaluations have often been followed by periods of more significant local inflation, with 2022 being a recent example. If that occurs, I'd anticipate incremental pricing opportunities to recover the currency devaluation impact. These potential pricing opportunities are not baked into the guidance range at this time since the amount or timing of subsequent inflation is difficult to estimate. The midpoint of this range assumes no economic improvement from the current environment and thus assumes flat base volumes. As Sanjiv mentioned, our base volumes derived from customer supply contracts. Their growth is a function of gas consumption from our contracted tanks and cylinders. Hence, why local industrial production tends to be the best proxy. First quarter EPS guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95, with similar assumptions to the full year. At this time, we believe it's appropriate to remain prudent with a more cautious economic outlook. If things turn out better, so too will our results. And if they worsen, we'll take additional mitigating actions. But regardless of the economy, I'm confident Linde will continue to create shareholder value through our time-tested execution culture, disciplined capital allocation and proven management actions. This has been embedded in our DNA for decades. And over the years, while many have claimed, they'll simply copy this model, all have failed, because here at Linde, we're often imitated but never duplicated. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: Sanjiv, there's a lot of political noise out there right now between tariff potential, new administration, some pullback on green energy funding. I guess how has your discussions with potential project partners evolved at all? I'm really trying to get at, say, projects that are pre-FID today. Have those discussions slowed down or picked up at all?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Mike, as we've referenced in previous calls, we have seen people take a little bit more time and apply a bit more rigor before going to FID. I think it's a good thing because you do need that when you're doing multibillion-dollar projects typically. And I think we're seeing that pace continue. In there, built in there, obviously, is some uncertainty around the regulatory framework and requirements in terms of what the new administration may or may not do. The one thing I do want to emphasize, though, and I think in the context of clean hydrogen, this is particularly important, people tend to think about the IRA and there's a lot of talk around what happens with the IRA under the new administration. Within the IRA, there is a specific provision, an IRS provision, in fact, called 45Q, which predates the IRA. It actually goes back to around 2008 when it was implemented. And about 90% of the projects that we are developing in the U.S. are actually looking at 45Q as a potential incentive. And I think we feel fairly confident that, that structure around the 45Q will remain as given particularly that it predates the IRA. So I just want to provide that specific clarification because I get a lot of questions around that. But generally, we're seeing people take a bit more time to get to FID, and we are seeing that they are actually being a little bit more rigorous in their approach before they make a final call in terms of putting capital on the ground. The other point I'd just quickly add to that, Mike, as you're aware that in the past, we've talked about -- I think it was actually 2 years ago, we talked about $8 billion to $10 billion in clean energy investments from a Linde perspective. We're about halfway there given the two projects, the large projects we've already announced North America. We're obviously continuing to develop projects elsewhere. Those two current projects we are working on are both likely to see another phase, which likely means that we will see equivalent investment there, plus the other projects as well. So when I look at the overall pipeline, I feel pretty good about the quality of projects that we're pursuing and the path to getting to that $8 billion to $10 billion of investments over the next few years looks pretty much intact.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Haynes with Morgan Stanley.
Steven Haynes: So it kind of looks like exiting the year, your EMEA margins are now like 200 basis points ahead of Americas, maybe 100 ex the cost pass-through. So do you think your Americas margins will gain ground in '25? And then also as a second piece of this, I think the gap is kind of widening versus APAC. So I was wondering if you could also kind of frame the opportunity there?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Steven. So if you go back historically, about 5 years ago, many of you asked the same question when Americas margins were leading. And I think APAC and EMEA were at 17% and 19%. And we have said then, and I want to repeat again today, that the -- our business is homogeneous, and there is no impediment to getting to the highest margins we see anywhere in our business. The one thing I often point out when we have this conversation around margins is each one of our segments has a country or a business, that has a margin with a [indiscernible] number in front of it. And in many ways, we encourage our businesses, each of the segments to push and try and understand what those successful businesses with a 40-plus percent margins are doing to ensure that we can bridge the gap. So to answer your question, both for Americas and APAC, my expectation remains that margins will continue to improve. And again, we've said in our prepared remarks earlier on, you should expect to see margin expansion in 2025 for Linde plc overall, which obviously is an aggregation of the different segments. I'd say to you that I'd probably say that, that margin expansion range is between 20 to 50 basis points. Typically, that's what we expect longer term. Obviously, we've been delivering well in excess of that, and that obviously sets up some expectations. But expect margin expansion. Each of those segments will continue to grow margin. No impediment to APAC, bridging that gap. And of course, America has got a solid business, which will continue to expand its margin as well.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fisher with Goldman Sachs.
Patrick Fischer: You talked about IP being your biggest KPI, which is fair. Roughly, what is the leverage if IP is up or down 1%? How much EPS does that generally drive for you? And then if you would maybe just take a spin around the world, what are you seeing IP? I know guiding to flat is prudent. But where do you see potential for things to be better or worse than that?
Sanjiv Lamba: I'll let Matt talk a little bit about the IP correlation and then I'll give you a walk around the world.
Matthew White: Yes, Duffy. So to start, as you probably know, so we split our volumes into project and base, and our project volumes solely track our startup. So that is, as you know, completely independent of any IP or macroeconomic factor, and it's purely contractual based on the fixed element. So that one is part of the capital allocation contribution on the EPS group. But to your point, when you think about base volumes, as Sandi mentioned, we have the rental, which is fixed, irregardless. That gets back to the resiliency of our model. As you recall, about 65% of our revenues are fairly resilient. But of the molecules that they take, whether in the cylinder, or whether in the tank for liquid, and to some extent, over fixed fees in the pipe, that's just going to be a function of their production. So from that end, that tends the best proxy to IP. And so I would say within the base volume piece, it aligns. Now to your point, we tend to get higher IP leverage in developing countries where they are expanding more, what you look at is intensity of gas per capita. Whereas in more developed nations, it's closer to a 1:1 ratio you tend to see on the IP and the base volume tracked. So that's how I would think about that. When you look around the world, I think we can all agree that how some countries report IP is not equal in all countries. But when we adjust for what we feel are a little bit of some noise in the numbers, what we've been seeing is IP close to zero, maybe tens of bps globally weighted on our businesses is what it's been ranging at. But we'll have to see how it plays out going forward. I think EMEA, a drag, as you know, Americas has been pretty solid. And I think China, depending upon which number you actually want to use, it can range anywhere from close to zero to the official number of 5%, and that's how we would kind of see the IP. But I'll hand off to Sanjiv, maybe you can give you a little walk around the world just with general color on trends.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. So that's helpful and just grounding you on how IP plays into our equation, but also how we think about it. Duffy, let me just walk you through the world. I think it's a question I'm sure it's on many people's minds. I'm going to try and break this down and parse it by two different perspectives. I'll start off with the markets that we have the end markets and use that as a characteristic to kind of define what we're expecting and then talk about different geographies as well. So starting over with resilient end markets. By the very nature, you would expect them to grow. And therefore, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth in our resilient end markets driven primarily by electronics and food and beverage. Industrial sector, obviously, more cyclical, impacted by industrial activity and demand. We do expect lower volumes there. And versus last year, we expect flat to lower volumes, particularly in metals and chemicals. If I now take the other perspective and talk about geographies, and I'm going to start off with maybe the Americas. Our expectation, low single-digit growth in the Americas across the Brazilian end markets. The industrial sector also expected to be kind of flattish against what we see last year. I won't specifically talk about the U.S. though. And in the U.S., I'd say to you, our current view remains, and I've said this before, right, U.S. volumes and sales at a high watermark, our expectation remains that in the first half of the year, they're likely to be flattish. That's what we're hearing from our customers. But towards the back end of the year, the second half was sure we are expecting increased momentum across the U.S., and we'll see that play through in how we see the Americas volumes and growth activity come through. On the other hand, a bit of a contrast unfortunately. In Europe, we expect to see continued softening. This is primarily in Western Europe, also a little bit in Eastern Europe, but primarily in Western Europe. The Brazilian end markets will continue to grow. There is a good trajectory there, and we'll expect that at [indiscernible] metals, manufacturing, chemicals, energy, all expected to be softer in lower volumes versus previous year. So Europe, unfortunately, is a drag at the moment. Now as far as Asia Pacific is concerned, I'll start off with China because I know that's on a number of your minds. I was in China 2 weeks ago, spent a week with the team talking to our customers, meeting a number of CEOs and getting a flavor of what I think is going to happen in China. And I think my short summary is, from our perspective, we don't expect anything significant in China in 2025. We're not baking in any kind of recovery. I think industrial volumes and activity will remain stable, but flat. No recovery in any of those sectors. Metals and Mining specifically is likely to be negative year-on-year for a number of reasons, driven partly by demand, but equally by some large turnarounds that our customers are taking in the course of the year. So we kind of see that play in Q1 and Q2. But again, Metals and Mining unlikely to see any growth. The one sector in China that is growing today and will continue to grow is their electronic sector. A lot of energy and a lot of money has been put into that sector by the government as well. So we do expect that, that will play out and continue to see some level of growth. If I was looking at China a bit more broadly, I'd say to you two trends of particular note coming out of my visit. The first that the government has recognized the need for support if it's got to get personal private consumption and the property market to pick up. It said a lot of things. Not enough stimulus has gone into the market. So we haven't seen any improvements other than the fact that in the last quarter, you saw a bit of improvement from industrial activity for exports. But we haven't really seen private consumption pickup happen. Now there are all kinds of subsidies in place that they're putting out there is small, but hopefully, they will have an impact over a period of time. So I'd say to you, I wouldn't hold my breath for 2025 in terms of improvement. But beyond that, longer term, certainly, we will see the China market stabilize and probably grow at a small pace than we used to. But certainly, we will expect to see growth come back. The rest of Asia Pacific is largely flat versus previous year, except for India, which is obviously the growth story at the moment. And again, given our strong presence in India, we are making the most of it winning more than our fair share. I feel really good about where that's going. That's kind of a view around what we see across the world and expect in 2025.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: It's David Huang here for Dave. What are your concerns if any of the [indiscernible] Linde play book will be now employed [indiscernible] products given the recent management change? I guess would that be a negative [indiscernible]? Has the shift away from focusing too much on mega projects? Could that change result in even more rational industry pricing environment?
Sanjiv Lamba: I didn't get your question entirely, but I'm going to answer it anyway. Linde has a leadership position in the market because of a number of factors. I said in my prepared remarks, you cannot replicate, and I think Matt put it really nicely, you can try and copy but you can never really duplicate what Linde has developed over many decades. And that's built into our operating rhythm, its built into our performance culture. And more importantly, it is built into the networks that we have developed across the world where because of the network density we have, we're able to get the margin improvement that we see and, of course, command the strength of the relationship with the customer and have the pricing power we have. That's what's demonstrated in the margin expansion that you've consistently seen over the last 5 years. We will continue to work on that. What others will or won't work on really is a question you will need to address to them. But I think Linda is the market leader, and we will reflect that in the behaviors we put out there in the marketplace consistently.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas.
Laurent Favre: Got a question on health care, where I think you've been around 0% organic growth every quarter in 2024. I was wondering if you could talk about what you've seen on price versus volumes? And if there's any specific area that is providing a big headwind? And I guess if you can expand into what you're thinking for 2025 for this one?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Laurent. You've heard me say this before that in the health care space, we expect long-term kind of mid-single-digit growth, and that's what we would expect. Now you know the health care sector is made up of two subsegments, if you like. The hospital care business, which is growing reasonably well and well on its way. And then obviously, the home care business around the world, which tends to be moving forward as well. Now we have, as you're aware, from past calls, we have said that we were doing some portfolio rationalization in our home care business out of the U.S. And in many ways, what the numbers you're seeing at the moment are reflecting some of the rationalization that has been done in that link care business. That is moving forward well. As you know, the Home Care business, in particular, given the inflationary environment that we see has to work really hard and productivity efforts. I'm happy to see that at Lincare, we are really seeing that progress being made. So it's looking pretty robust and resilient as things stand. At some stage, we will lap these portfolio actions, and you will see the long-term kind of mid-single -- low to mid-single-digit growth that we would expect from health care overall.
Laurent Favre: And if I can have a follow-up on the project side, you talked mostly about decimalization related projects that would be signed in the future. You didn't mention electronics. Is there a specific reason for that? I don't think we've seen significant new FIDs in electronics on your side over the last couple of years. Is this an area where we should be expecting new projects?
Sanjiv Lamba: So I'll only tell you that 20% of my all-time record sale of gas backlog is electronics. We are executing on electronics projects as we speak. And I'm more than happy to tell you that we'll be announcing new wins very shortly as well. So I'm not sure whether that question really addressed a specific point. But I think really good about electronics and our specific position in there. In fact, we took our board recently to the -- to our Phoenix facility, which serves TSMC, which you know has been a very successful project for TSMC. So we feel really good about it. Executing a number of projects as we speak. They are starting up and providing impact, and we continue to win more than our fair share.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: In 2024, your cash flow from operations was up 1%, even though your EPS grew about 10%. Was that a depressed number? And so when you look at 2025 and your EPS growth of 4% to 7%, is cash flow from operations going to grow higher or lower? And then secondly, in terms of market share in the overall industrial gas market, is market share pretty much constant for all of the major players? Or are you gaining share overall or losing share? Is there any share shift?
Sanjiv Lamba: Just -- I'll let Matt talk about the cash flows, and then we'll talk about the market.
Matthew White: Yes. Jeff. So on the OCF, to your point, we tend to look at EBITDA rates to OCF rates. So similar to what you were saying, but instead of EPS, EBITDA. And to your point, though, they should grow similarly. And the ratio we tend to always look to achieve on OCF to EBITDA is usually in the low 80s. And to your exact point, what we had occur over the last probably, I would say 24 months give or take, is this unwinding of our engineering portfolio as we worked out the sanctioned projects. And so what that created was you had a large influx of deposits of cash that stopped. And then we had to settle the payments to basically suppliers and you had a very rapid acceleration of an unwind. So that created a large outflow of cash associated with the engineering business. And that's what created a slower growth of OCF relative to EBITDA. Because essentially what you had was some liabilities, which are the contract liabilities, if you look at that specific line has been quite unfavorable. And what it is, is these liabilities are unwinding on the wind down, but they're not cash generative. So that's why they create that unfavorable aspect on the working capital line that you see. So that is what's been driving this inability for the EBITDA and OCF to grow together. We've substantially gotten through all that. i our engineering business. I expect 2025 to be a lot closer aligned on those growth rates. But this is -- normally, this is how the engineering percent completion business works. Normally, it's spread over a 4-year build cycle, so you don't notice it. But given the events of the sanctioned projects, it got compressed into a much tighter structure as we had to deal with the sanction projects.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. And let me talk about market share. So actually, Jeff, to be honest, we don't spend a lot of time thinking and talking about market share. I think it's something that we can segment down and talk about specifics, and that's what I'm going to do for you. So I'm going to start off by just reminding you record sale of gas backlog of $7-plus billion, right. Has a good test of where market share is headed. And to be honest, we're winning more than our fair share of those large projects, which are, as I'll remind you, and as we said in our prepared remarks, those are contracted growth with good solid terms and conditions, including termination guaranteeing a minimal return on capital that is guaranteed. So just as a reminder, that very rigorous definition of backlog where we are excelling today with a record backlog that demonstrates on the larger project side and how we are positioned in terms of market share. For the merchant and package business, the concept of market share is less relevant. What is more important and which is where we spend most of our time is thinking about network density. Clearly, if you have network density, you are the leading player in that market usually by a mile. So it is very important to make sure that network density is what you try through the decisions you make, and in terms of how you manage your business on a day-to-day basis. So I feel pretty good about the network that we've developed and the strength of our market position in each one of those networks, Ih actually results in, as I said earlier, getting the margin expansion that we look for and getting the market position and the strength of our relationship with our customers because of those networks that we've developed. So I'll just summarize by saying Linde remains a market leader, and we expect that leadership to continue to move forward given these elements that I just talked about.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Steve Byrne: I was wanting to better understand this the 59 small on-site wins. Maybe more specifically, how would you compare the contract terms of those small on-sites versus the long on sites. I would assume these are long-term take-or-pay agreements, some of them maybe even have your own employees on site. So how would you compare the returns on these projects versus the big ones? And is -- can you comment on what are the gases that are driving these small on-sites, i.e., is this oxygen for oxyfuels or this hydrogen, et cetera?
Sanjiv Lamba: That's a fantastic question, Steve, and I really wanted somebody to raise it. So thanks for doing that. 59 long-term contracts, you would have read, we signed 59 long-term contracts and are building 64 plants. All of this happened in the space of the last 12 months. So feel really good about breaking that record. Now let's talk about the profile of the small onsite. I get excited about small on sites because from so many different perspectives, they are actually a perfect way of generating annuity income for this business. And you can imagine this building 64 plants will be starting out more than 1 plant a week to make sure that, that revenue and cash generation happens. Let's talk about returns, terms and conditions and the types of gases. So I think good to start with the types of gases. We use both oxygen, nitrogen and indeed, in the future, we expect to see electrolyzer-based hydrogen, which is currently not included in our definition for smaller side wins. But at some stage, we'll see that as a developing portfolio element to be added on to the small onsite. Oxygen, nitrogen largely, obviously, I'll give you a great example. So we've been working with many customers. I'll take one [indiscernible] on Illinois, where we've been supporting them on their decarbonization efforts. And in this particular case, we have a piece of application technology called OptiMelt that we have developed, and we have deployed that successfully across a number of class customers, [indiscernible] being a good example of one of those where we are able to recover -- do heat recovery, which allows them to get significant efficiencies, reduced natural gas consumption and run the throughput of their furnaces at a significantly higher level. That's a good example of small on-site, goes on site, actually provide that. We do the same with paper and pulp. We do the same with electronics, et cetera, which is where we would largely use nitrogen as an example. So both of these gases drive our small onsite portfolio and are kind of largely equally split between the different technologies that we apply and win. The terms of these small on-site contracts range between 10 and 15 years exactly identical to what you would typically see on the large on-site piece, the terms and conditions are almost identical as well. Same fixed fee elements that we talk about similar profile in terms of cash flows. What tends to happen though is that the execution time line for these projects is much shorter. Typically, we'd be able to deploy a small on-site anywhere between 9 to 15 months. As you know, the large on-site projects or the larger projects that we do tend to take longer in terms of their construction commissioning period. So again, a very, very nice piece often on the small on site, we're able to derisk the execution as well because the execution or a portion of the civil is carried out by the customer and again, helps us both implement and construct quickly but also have the customer take the risk around the civil piece as well. That brings me in the end to returns. And our returns typically above small on-sites are above what we would see on average for some of the large projects. So I feel really good about the return, highly accretive to our portfolio. And again, you've been seeing over the last 4 or 5 years, we put a lot of focus on developing this part of the portfolio and are really seeing the benefits of that in the 59 long-term contract we signed and the 64 plants we're building up. All in, I think really a good part of the portfolio, we have very excited about it.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Avi on for Mike. This was sort of touched on earlier in the call, but I wondered if you could just the contributions from pricing versus productivity and cost management when we're talking about forward-looking guidance for the quarter and for the year?
Matthew White: Avi, it's Matt. So we don't split that out. But as Sanjiv mentioned on the algorithm. So we've got 10-plus percent in the combination of the capital allocation contribution and the management action contribution. And for purposes of guidance, I'd say roughly split 50-50, just say 5% at this stage. Historically, management actions have been the larger contribution. But we always need and want to think about that as a spread, right. To think about one in isolation to us doesn't make a lot of sense because you'll see very different inflation levels in different countries. So the local spread of price to cost inflation is a critical metric for us because that positive spread is what's part of the compound value creation of the model. So I would say it's a very, very local discussion, but the spread needs to remain positive. That's a big component of the margin expansion, the long-term margin expansion as well. But I'd say for purposes of the guidance right now, just assume it's roughly half from management actions at the 10% and half from capital allocation of the 10%, so 5 and 5 And as Sanjay mentioned, we're obviously going to continue to take actions to try and improve on that, but that's what's laid out in the guidance at this stage.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: So a question around the $10 billion backlog between sale of gas and sale of equipment. How much of the equipment at this point is locked in, where we don't have to worry about tariffs or maybe the benefit of the strong dollar? And how much of it is there a little bit of exposure on? How should we be thinking about that?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, John. So again, as you said, $10 billion in backlog, about $3.1 billion or $3.2 billion of that sits in the SOE side, the sale of equipment side, and the balance 7 plus sitting in the sale of CASA. So as far as tariffs are concerned, obviously, we've been looking at the portfolio. On the SOE side, our contractual protection typically takes care of that. So we go in with firm pricing with our contractors and wherever necessary, we have contractual protection to make sure that events like tariffs, et cetera, get adequately covered. On the sale of gas side, where we're doing a lot of the procurement, we're obviously managing and tracking that quite closely. We did that study recently for our U.S. projects and actually the impact of the tariffs is de minimis. So really, we are not seeing any impact there. Now our experience of the past has been, and there were tariffs -- have been tariffs for a while now, including the first round of the administration a few years ago. When we dealt with this, one of the things we found was when tariffs did get introduced, typically, they didn't really impact our firm offers that we put in on the procurement cycle. But also more importantly, we got some benefit typically out of devaluation of currencies that more than offset the tariff impact, if there was impact of any significance. So all in, I'd say to you, we've looked at tariffs. It's part of what we've done in the past. And kind of manage that adequately at this point in time, we feel pretty good about where our projects stand.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with Bernstein.
Peter Clark: I hope I don't ask something that's been asked before. But I'm not terribly surprised with your guidance, but maybe I was a bit off on the ForEx. And using the sales line, I guess, slightly lower, but I'm assuming you've got some very profitable markets in there that are being hit very hard with the currency, I'm thinking Mexico, maybe Brazil a bit. Just wondering if there's an element of that in that guidance? And then allied to that, the tariff risk. I know gases don't travel. I know it's mostly for customers in the region. But again, some of these very profitable markets are ones at risk in terms of tariffs. And again, Mexico would be a classic in terms of that. Just how you think around that as well?
Matthew White: Peter it's Matt. So we'll start on the FX. Yes, you actually hit on the two bigger ones. Brazil and Mexico were the larger ones. I would say if you think about the evolution of FX through 2024, some of the European-based currencies, as you probably know, were almost quite favorable to flat in the beginning of 2024. But unfortunately, what you were seeing where a lot of Lat Am currencies devalue fairly materially. The peso, Mexico peso will be one, the Brazilian real and then Argentinian peso, as you can imagine, which is on a managed devaluation, which uses hypercurrency inflation. So the LatAm currencies we're probably seeing more of the brunt in the first half to 2/3 of the year. But what we saw in the fourth quarter, just given some of the geopolitical and political events was a significant flight to the dollar. I think DXY index is probably the best indicator of that. If you sort of look at DXY right around the beginning -- or prior to the U.S. elections to where it ended in the year, it appreciated almost 10%. And I think you gave a pretty good indication of the 6 major basket currencies, of which that index is comprised of. How much those major currencies you saw that move. So that was, I would say, it was a 2-stage impact on the rates. And what that ended up with was some of the more larger currencies like the I and the sterling and the Aussie dollar, et cetera, really devalued in the back half of the fourth quarter. So that -- I'd say that was the dynamic we saw. It will be what it will be, right. We'll obviously, as we mentioned, you book on the average rate each month and then we'll see if the devaluations do create inflationary aspects. I think Sanjiv had mentioned the tariffs and as you can imagine, our impact on the tariffs is really indirect. We don't -- since we're so localized to your point, we don't have much direct impact. Sanjiv mentioned the equipment, which is small, and that tends to self-correct. So it really just comes down to a function of the customers that we supply and what production levels they have. Given our leading density positions in a lot of these economies, we feel quite good that we are there to capture where the products move to because I think at the end of the day, which you have to ask yourself with these tariffs, is production shifting? Or will there be a reduction of production? But in a shifting basis, we feel quite good. We'll capture where it goes. And if there is a net reduction, the question will be from where. So time will tell on that, but this is more going to be a function of that IP we talked about, and we'll see how it plays out. But given the guide we gave on basically a zero IP at the midpoint, we'll have to see how things play on that.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi.
Patrick Cunningham: Just on the step-up in CapEx for 2025, is most of that being driven by the two large projects? And is this step-up from those projects more meaningful in 2026 as well?
Sanjiv Lamba: Patrick, the -- we just referenced the sale of gas backlog being an all-time high at $7.1 billion clearly, that's the reason why you're seeing the step-up in CapEx. And obviously, sitting within that are the two large projects that we're executing around the clean energy piece, but also a number of electronics projects, et cetera. So that is really -- that's all that's driving the CapEx number as things down.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho.
John Roberts: Your competitor had a large nonrecurring helium sale in the quarter. Does that take down industry helium prices? Or how would you characterize the helium market?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, I think the helium market continues to display exactly the characteristics that we've been seeing for the most of 2024, in fact. As I look at the helium market today, I'd say to you that there are parts of the world where helium is long. Asia is one of them. As you know, about 1/3 of all the imports into China coming out of Russia, which obviously has unbalance that market to some extent. The demand side on helium remains flattish. We see some softness around electronics and maybe MRI, but that tends to kind of pick up during the course of the year. Pricing as things stand remains stable. We are not seeing any significant movements on pricing. Corrections had happened, as you know, about a year or 18 months ago. There's nothing unexpected happening. The -- you're referencing a transaction that I won't comment on at this stage, but there are shifts in helium supply and demand all the time. There is nothing new happening over here that will impact the market itself.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Matt [indiscernible] on for Kevin McCarthy. Regarding the new CCS hub in Jabal, could you provide more details on the scope and structure of your investment in the project? How large is the investment? And do you see this project being foundational in nature in that it could turn into a base hub for additional follow-on investments with the goal of increasing regional asset density?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. So essentially, I'm going to give you a high-level view of the project. It hasn't gone to FID when it does, you will hear us talk a bit more about it. But essentially, it's a 3-way joint venture that is developing, which will be in its first phase, a very large CCS project in Saudi. The 3 partners are led by Saudi Aramco, SRB and Linde. Each kind of contributing their skill set into that project. The first phase of the project is between 9 million to 11 million tonnes per annum of CO2 being sequester. There is an expectation that there will be 2 more phases by the end of the third phase when it gets completed, this could well be the world's largest CCS project at 54 million or 53 million tonnes per annum of CO2 being captured and sequester. So yes, there is potential for growth beyond. Obviously, we will assess those phases when they happen. At this point in time, this joint venture structure is developing the project. The feed has been completed. The capital is being assessed as we speak. So I'm not going to give you a firm number just yet. I expect FID in the next few months. And once that happens, you'll get a lot more detail around it. But it is a fairly significant project with some exceptional partners in a part of the world where Linde will strengthen its position. And obviously, there will be a future opportunity to continue to grow with this. Alongside this project, we will also look at developing a blue hydrogen project, which was leverage the CCS infrastructure that has been developed in this project. But again, when that goes to FID in due course and meets our investment criteria, and we have a project worth talking about. You'll hear us talk a bit more about that.
Operator: And we will now take our final question from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Daniel Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. I was just wondering what your view is on the depth of the pipeline of potential hydrogen projects, particularly in the EU and Japan?
Sanjiv Lamba: So I said this earlier, and I'm going to maybe just quickly recap my earlier comments and then talk specifically about the markets you've mentioned. So we have seen that people are being more rigorous and applying more diligence before they take on FID decisions for these large projects. And when I think about our pipeline and the context of that, I feel really good about the strength of the high-quality projects we have in our pipeline that we are developing. We're developing those projects, as you would expect in the U.S., in Canada, so in North America, in the Middle East, largely in Saudi Arabia, but also potentially in [indiscernible] in Europe, particularly with partners like Equinor, where potentially we have an opportunity to provide low carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen into the European network. And then we are looking at some projects in Asia which are localized for local markets. Your specific question around Europe and Japan, I would say to you that the projects in Japan are minimal other than the fact that Japan is a very important market from an import perspective that they would want to import in either clean hydrogen or derivatives such as ammonia methanol into their market for a host of applications that they have determined are needed for their decarbonization effort. So everybody is looking at Far East from a point of ability to export into that market, which is why it remains an important market alongside Japan [indiscernible] Korea as well. But the development itself in Japan, I think, is minimal. As far as Europe is concerned, obviously, you see a lot of discussion around clean hydrogen in Europe, including green and including blue and so on and so forth. The reality is that the regulatory framework is so difficult that to be able to get to a decision point and a very large substantive investment requires a lot of time, and I think we're seeing that play out in Europe as things stand, which is why there is a real feel that the European aspirations for the amount of hydrogen they need for that market will not be entirely met because the combination of the time to kind of decipher the regulatory framework and to make investment decisions in this environment is obviously a little more challenging.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Abby, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel reach out directly. Take care.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. And I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Abby, thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for attending our 2024 third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the supplement, and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's third quarter financial performance and outlook. After which we will wrap up the Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Juan and good morning everyone. Third quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience and resolve of Linde employees across the globe. EPS, ROC and operating margin reached new highs despite challenging economic conditions in most countries. But frankly, none of this came as a surprise. Some of you may recall that we anticipated sluggish industrial activity this quarter and it played out as expected. Looking ahead, I have concerns regarding continued economic weakness. So, we've taken a series of proactive actions, including targeted cost reductions. Matt will provide more details on this charge, and it affects approximately 2% of the workforce globally and is expected to be mostly completed in the next few months. In light of these actions, it may be helpful to provide you additional color on the end market trends, which you can find on Slide 3. Industrial-related end markets have declined 1% to 2% sequentially from the second quarter. This trend is consistent with our prior comments as well as the industrial-related macroeconomic statistics. However, we did experience some positive growth over prior year, including in North America, which at almost 40% of global sales continues to be a bright spot. On-site and merchant volumes are slightly up in the U.S. In addition, North American project activity continues to progress. This said, these positive trends contrast with most of EMEA and parts of APAC, primarily China. The combination of geopolitical tension and economic uncertainty has suppressed large ticket purchases, which tend to correlate with industrial markets such as steel, glass and chemicals. Currently, we don't see any meaningful catalyst to reverse this trend for the remainder of this year and thus have embedded this view in our guidance. We believe this is the most prudent position to take at this time. Conversely, consumer-related end markets are slightly positive versus second quarter with continued growth in food and beverage and stability in health care. Electronics was up high single-digit over previous year. As expected, recovery in electronics continues to move forward, but at a lower clip. While recovery is slow, we fully expect electronics to provide sequential growth in the next quarter, including project backlog ramp-ups. Taken together, these trends point to a stagnant or slightly declining economic backdrop. However, a combination of actions on pricing, productivity and costs, combined with contractually secured project backlog and robust stock repurchases continue to support our ability to deliver shareholder value regardless of the challenges. In fact, our backlog in the third quarter hit $10 billion as we signed our largest sale of gas project in company history. This contract with Dow Chemical is a testament to our disciplined investment approach to pursue and win projects in our core competence of reliable and cost-effective industrial gas supply. Slide 4 provides more details on this $2 billion plus investment fall Dow is embarking on an ambitious project to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions in their Alberta Canada complex through a series of initiatives, including fuel searching from natural gas to low carbon or otherwise known as blue hydrogen. We're proud to be selected as the industrial gas partner to provide atmospheric acids, low carbon hydrogen and services for both CO2 capture and off-gas cleanup. For Phase 1, Linde's total investment is expected to be over $2 billion, underpinned by a traditional over-the-fence gas supply contract that aligns with our investment criteria. We expect this project to start up in late 2028. I think it's important to note the size and scope we are undertaking. It's more than just low carbon hydrogen production. The clean energy transition will draw upon several different Linde capabilities, expertise and product offerings since integrated gas management solutions are in greater demand. In addition to supplying Dow, this investment will enhance our existing footprint and provide substantial density for future extensions. In fact, we're already in conversations with future potential customers. All-in, this project aligns well with our core strategy to pursue traditional industrial gas contracts with high-quality customers in key geographic regions of industrial density. Overall, we see a challenging economic future, but are well prepared. Linde is heading into this uncertainty with the largest sale of gas backlog in company history, an incredibly strong balance sheet and a lean and well-focused workforce with a proven track record in successfully navigating typical conditions time after time. And while I may not be bullish on the global economy, I've never been more confident in Linde's ability to sustain industry-leading results while rewarding our owners. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.
Matt White: Thanks Sanjiv. Third quarter results can be found on Slide 5. Sales of $8.4 billion are up 2% from last year and 1% sequentially. Versus prior year, engineering increased sales 2% from higher project activity and higher demand for LNG infrastructure. While both cost pass-through and currency translation are down 1%. As a reminder, cost pass-through represents the contractual building of energy changes to on-site customers and has no impact to operating profit dollars. Excluding these items, organic sales are up 2%, driven by price increases. Volumes are flat as growth from the project backlog is mostly offset by weaker base volumes. As mentioned earlier, the global industrial environment remains stagnant as many economies continue to report flat to negative industrial production levels. Despite these trends, operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 7% from last year, resulting in an operating margin of 29.6% or 130 basis points higher. Project contribution, price and cost productivity drove profit growth. EPS of $3.94 is up 9% from 2023 or 10% when excluding the impact of currency translation. These figures exclude a $150 million net restructuring charge, which represents severance costs for a 2% workforce reduction in the regions most affected by weaker volumes. We anticipate full run rate savings to be recognized in the second half of next year. Slide 6 provides an update on our capital management. Operating cash for the quarter was $2.7 billion, 8% above last year and 42% higher than the second quarter. As anticipated, we saw a significant sequential improvement driven by interest, tax and incentive timing. I expect to maintain this OCF level for the fourth quarter. Our capital allocation policy remains stable with $3.4 billion invested into the business and $5.1 billion return to shareholders. In the third quarter, total CapEx spending is up 12% versus prior year, with project CapEx up 40% from executing the $7 billion sale of gas backlog, but base CapEx is down 4%. As a reminder, the Linde project backlog only contains growth projects underpinned by a customer contract, with fixed fee returns that are protected with termination provisions. Our definition is unique and the most stringent across the industry. The base CapEx decline is from productivity initiatives as well as better aligning non-backlog spend with local market conditions. I'll wrap-up with guidance on Slide 7. For the fourth quarter, we're initiating an EPS guidance range of $3.86 to $3.96, or 8% to 10% growth from prior year. This range assumes an economic contraction at the midpoint since we have not seen sufficient indicators of near-term improvement. In addition, this range assumes no currency impact, although the U.S. dollar has strengthened noticeably in the last few weeks as we approach the U.S. presidential election. The full year range merely incorporates the Q4 guide and thus becomes $15.40 to $15.50 or 9% to 10% growth, excluding a 1% FX headwind. The top end was reduced by $0.10 from prior quarter since we updated our sequential economic assumption from neutral to a contraction. While no one knows for sure what will happen, we believe this approach is prudent for this environment. In summary, global industrial activity has been weak, and we do not anticipate near-term improvement. In fact, geopolitical tensions and regulatory uncertainty only appear to add volatility and potential downside events. However, as Sanjiv mentioned, we're prepared for this uncertainty. We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry with the most disciplined project backlog at $10 billion, ensuring high quality growth for years to come. We have a well-honed operating rhythm, enabling our employees to take decisive and timely actions for their respective markets. And we have the densest network across all three supply modes to capitalize on every growth opportunity. No matter what the future brings, I have confidence we will continue to deliver industry-leading performance. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: thank you and we'll now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning to you. I wanted to ask your guiding to economic contraction in the fourth quarter. It seems like some of the cost actions you're taking this quarter, there's perhaps some incremental macro caution that you're positioning for heading into next year. So, can you speak to where in your business either regionally or end market where you're seeing the most macro pressures today?
Sanjiv Lamba: Mike, I think as I said in my prepared remarks, you would have heard that I think describing the world, there aren't many bright spots. So, really, in essence, we are seeing the European market, EMEA may have more broadly, clearly seeing pressure, and that's reflected in the volume developments that we see in that market. We've seen China where there was a short-lived euphoria around the stimulus. We know that the underlying industrial progression there is not reflecting that and unlikely to see a catalyst with change in the near-term. So, bright sparks or bright spots, as I defined that in those remarks, was really North America, primarily in the U.S., which has proven to be very resilient thus far. And is at a high watermark and we are hoping to see that slight sluggish or softness that we've seen, hopefully move back into a more stable and steady growth rate. We have other smaller countries. India would be a good example where we are seeing consistent growth. We continue to be -- we are the market leader there. Therefore, we continue to be benefiting from that. Similarly, Mexico also benefiting like India from the near-shoring, reshoring strategies that people are deploying. So, across the world, we see broadly the industrial recession or industrial weaknesses. And we've been talking about for many quarters now, Mike, as you would recall. This is a new. And I think the actions we've taken now really are a reflection of our view of what we see the challenges going forward, but also the fact that there has been this long weakness in the industrial space.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you very much and good morning. You announced a de-captivation of two ASUs in India, I believe, earlier in the week or last week. Are you seeing more activity there or interest there, just given the weakness in the economic activity, are customers looking maybe to get some assets off their balance sheet? Or was that just something you've been looking at for a while until they came to fruition?
Sanjiv Lamba: I will talk about that specific opportunity first, and then I'll give you a slightly broader view of what I see around de-captivation globally. Let's start with the de-captivation that we did. The plants were being constructed by the customer who had sourced the plants from a competitor. They were very keen that Linde over those assets. particularly because we were able to integrate them into our extensive network that exists today in Kalinga Nagar, Orissa, which is one of India's large steel enclaves. So, we were able to provide a very innovative solution, both from sourcing energy but also providing safe and reliable supply from our asset network, again, leveraging that network density that we often speak about. It's a great project. We have a long-standing relationship with our customer. The project meets our investment criteria and enhances network density. I couldn't have asked for a better combination of factors to come together when I looked at that. That is what we look for in de-captivation. You might recall a few quarters ago now, we've done a re-captivation for assets in Fujian in China. And all of these exact metrics of these conditions were satisfied for us to take that onboard as well. So broadly on de-captivation, I'd say to you, we probably every year, this is not new, every year, we assess anywhere between eight to 10 opportunities for deactivation. We are selective about the ones we pursue because we see the ability to integrate them into our network and to leverage that benefit both for creating great supply options for the customer, but more importantly, we're creating value at our end as well. When network density is at play, we will certainly find these very, very attractive for us to take on.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning. Question around the health care business. Earlier this year, you were pruning some parts of that. So can you just walk us through what's been pruned and what are we anniversarying? When does that anniversary end? And is there more to come? And then maybe just a third one to tap on to that. What do you think the structural growth rate is for healthcare 2025 and going forward?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Duffy. So, let's go back to the health care piece. The headline of there is health care grew year-on-year, a small percentage, but it grew. And I think the home care part of our business, as you recall, Duffy, we have two elements to the Healthcare business. Hospital care, which is a very stable business that we serve across the world. And home care business that we participate in specific markets, obviously, a large market here in the U.S. as well for home care. Much of our pruning of the portfolio and cleaning it up was all around the home care business largely in the U.S. That, I would say to you, has largely been completed. In fact, you might recall in the last call, I said by the end of the year, I expect all of that cleanup to be completed. I think we will see that done by the end of the year. We are on track structurally to see growth rates between low single-digit to mid-single-digit in the health care space. That's kind of our expectation, and I fully expect the health care business to be there as we look ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Sanjiv, Matt, economic contraction in Q4, does that reflect seasonal slowdowns as well as perhaps longer-than-normal planned shutdowns? Or is this over and above what you would normally see seasonally and even extended year-end planned shutdowns?
Matt White: Hey David, it's Matt. The way we think about it at your point, it is sequential. So to your exact statement there, we view it as a sequential contraction. And it would be across the base organic volumes. It would not be seasonal. As you know, we have a normal seasonal pattern that we view is consistent. But if there are extended outages, we would view that as a weakness, right? Because you tend to have an average outage for certain, you could call it holiday periods. And when you see those extend on the front and the back end, that usually is because the customer may not have the order intake or the workload to work at a harder pace. And so they tend to extend around outages. So, it does not include seasonality. It is only the base volumes. But to that extent, we definitely could see people extending outages given that. But I do want to just make sure I state that we don't know if this is right or wrong. This is just a view that's in the guidance. Obviously, we're taking actions around it. We're getting ahead of it. If this does happen, we feel we're prepared. If we're wrong and things are better, then that would be a potential upside for us.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Yes, good morning everyone. Is one on the targets for the $8 billion to $10 billion investment. So well done on finally getting down at the zero side into the backlog. My understanding is that certainly some of your close relationships getting very positive or increasingly positive on the space and maybe looking closely at Signature. have been obviously very positive on U.S. blue ammonia. Equinor, I think you've got some financing in place or some incentives in place in Europe, these companies very close to particularly with BSF and made three, four feasibility study that has dragged out as well going on. Just if you can comment around that sort of scenario because you still got $8 billion to $10 billion out there, you're halfway there pretty much. You've obviously got some confidence you're going to get that target.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Peter. So, let's start off with just assessing where we stand against that $8 billion to $10 billion, and I'll probably give you a slightly broader overview of what development we are seeing around hydrogen. On the $8 billion to $10 billion, as you rightly put it, I feel pretty confident about where we are. We've signed up about half of that between OCI and obviously, Dow Phase I. Peter, you'll remember that Dow has a Phase 2, which we haven't obviously committed to just yet, but that will develop in its own course. Alongside that, we are doing a lot of front-end work at the moment on a number of projects. You referenced a couple of those already. And as I see the developments around hydrogen more broadly, I feel pretty confident that, that $8 billion to $10 billion number over the next few years looks pretty much intact and something that I feel confident about. I will, however, just step back and give you a broader overview on what I'm seeing around hydrogen. And I think you'll probably see this as well. So this shouldn't come as a surprise at all. But we have been talking about hydrogen developments and saying that there is a high degree of euphoria. So what we're seeing today is indeed what we had expected. I would segment the hydrogen development into the following elements and say to you, you are seeing and hearing a about a number of project cancellations getting announced recently. In fact, most of them tend to be around what we call renewable hydrogen or otherwise known as green hydrogen, and driven by a number of factors, but key amongst them the fact that incentives are unclear, regulatory framework is still being threshed out, capital costs are elevated. People haven't quite expected that or haven't done enough work when announcing projects early on to recognize that capital costs are on the rise. And last but not least, returns aren't as promising as people thought they might be. So in many ways, that initial euphoria is dying down and being -- getting a bit of a sanity check or a reality check. And what you see as a consequence of that is substantive projects, high-quality projects, which make economic sense are the ones that are still around. That's a good thing for hydrogen growth and development in the long term. The good news is we are very selective on the projects we work on, and I feel pretty good about the projects that we currently are developing, most of those, as you would expect, and as we've said before, are in the low carbon hydrogen space or what otherwise is known as blue hydrogen. The technology is mature and available and scaled up today. There is operating expertise around that. And the end product is very cost competitive. All those factors become a key element when people are making decisions on how they manage their decarbonization projects, which are a challenge economically, as you know. So, that's kind of where we see the trend today. And I'm pleased actually that, that reality check is in place because that's what we need for substantial development on the hydrogen space.
Peter Clark: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Your sequential prices were flat. If you -- now we're in something of a deflationary environment. So, if you exclude the negative pricing if there was negative pricing in your on-site business, was it the case that price/mix would have sequentially grown? Or maybe another way of saying it, did price/mix sequentially grow in your packaged and merchant business during the quarter? Or was it flat?
Matt White: Hey Jeff, it's Matt. So, a couple of things, I think. It's not an issue of on-site. And I wouldn't say we're in a deflation area, I would describe it more as disinflationary when you think globally. Maybe China might be deflationary. But so we're still seeing positive pricing across all of our base gases. And as you know, when we talk about 2% globally, the way to translate that because we tend to calculate it primarily just for merchant and package. It's about double the number of what you're seeing in merchant and package. So, to your point, we still continue to see both positive sequential and positive year-over-year pricing there. Clearly, something like helium, I think we all know the pricing there is a little more globally based on supply/demand. And there, it's maybe slightly declining to flat, and that could have an effect on there. But also when you look within the quarters, you're just going to have some timing impacts. I tend not to be overly concerned on that. Certain contracts, you'll have anniversary dates that the increases happen. So, you can see some timing and lumpiness. We still feel quite good about the fourth quarter, where we stand and where we'll be on that. So, I'm not overly concerned. I think our pricing still continues to track with the globally weighted CPI that we see in our regions. And I think the disinflation will have a little bit of a lower number at the global level, but it will still be positive and it will still contribute.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Steve Byrne: Yes, thank you. You're going to build this ATR for Dow, and you're going to reform C3 and C4 not hydrogen then methane. Have you designed an APR like this before? And if you need or want more hydrogen then will be required by Dow to heat their crackers, will you have the ability to reform natural gas in this ATR if you develop your own network of hydrogen customers in the area? And then just lastly, is this whole approach of reforming cracker byproducts, is this something you could see potentially employed down in the U.S. Gulf?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Steve. Great question. So, I think this is where Linde brings a huge amount of value, our ability to provide a technical solution that integrates various technology packages and kind of provide whatever is required by the end customer. So, you've clearly spotted that. I'm going to just maybe take a minute and talk through what we're actually doing. So, on the ground, we're going to put two large assets to your point earlier. There is an ATR of 300 million a day, let's say, which is going to process natural gas and as you would expect, normal ATRs to do, and provide hydrogen as a consequence of that. As you know, from an ATR technology perspective, the autothermal reformer provides very high concentration, high purity CO2 onstream. So, capturing that CO2 is a next step in our process, which we can do coming out of the ATR very easily. So, that's one piece to your point, have we kind of designed this before? Yes, we are actually operating on in today and have been doing that for about four to five years, in fact, and it's, in fact, if anything, how the top so we provided that technology package, bring a lot of their customers because it's one of the best running ATRs anywhere in the world. So, feel very good about the technology, having decided before, and we are currently building it also at OCI. So, have a good track record on that. We feel good about the ATR technology overall. Add on to that, the second technology package, which is a PSA unit that we're putting, which takes the Again, as you rightly pointed out, we will process the off cash. We will clean it up. We will provide that clean hydrogen back to Dow. And we will provide the rest, either as fuel or if there is CO2 coming out, we will capture that as well and provide that for to Dow as well. So, again, integrating that PSA unit plus the ATR is a very smart way of providing a great technical solution. The point you made on the Gulf Coast of Texas, we actually already do this in the Gulf Coast. So, we have a track record of having built these PSC units to take off gas coming from the cracker, clean it up and provide it back to the customer. So we are actually applying some of those learnings that came out of that and creating a really, really solid solution here for Dow.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen Richardson: Hi good morning. Sanjiv, it seems like we've had a bit of an acceleration of late on restructuring and potential exit announcements, particularly from the European industry, chemicals and the like. Can you talk at all about any conversations you're having with customers or any -- how you think about that as kind of a risk or an opportunity from your assets on the continent and how those discussions traditionally go to the extent that you do have customers that do want to shut down or restructure?
Sanjiv Lamba: So, Steve, you're absolutely right that in the press, you read a lot about some of these proposed actions that large companies are taking. I can only tell you that that currently, we've not heard from any of our major customers in Europe discussing major closures. So, -- not to say that we don't keep a close eye on it. We are obviously tracking that very, very closely, recognizing the news that's in the air. But as things stand, we haven't had any of those conversations just yet. I'll also go on to tell you that, and I think you know this already, but let me reiterate that when the customers do decide to undertake that part of shutdown, we have solid contracts in place that will ensure that we protect our investment. And I think that's part of our model, and that's part of the contracting discipline that we bring about in every project that we undertake. So, I feel pretty good about where we stand at least in terms of protecting the interest of our investors.
Stephen Richardson: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning guys. A lot of companies have talked about 2025, I know it's a little bit early to give specific guidance, but a lot have hinted that they felt the first half of 2025 would be similar to the second half of 2024, which as you depicted not great. Is that kind of what you see initially? And then when you think about 2025 in general, this growth algorithm, fairly similar, you got pricing potential, backlog and stock buybacks for now?
Sanjiv Lamba: So, Mike, I'm sure you're key to hear from us on what 2025 will bring, but you'll have to hold on to that for a while because we come back in February and give you a very comprehensive view on that. As you might expect, we are internally putting a lot of energy into doing our planning for the next year, and I think those planned meetings are going to happen in the next three weeks. So, we'll spend a lot of time thinking about that, talking about that, and we'll come back in February and give you a much better view and a lot more granularity on how we see 2025.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, a question on the sale of gas backlog. So, you more than doubled it. It's up almost $4 billion just from the last quarter. It looks like down is about half of that. I guess, can you help us to think about the other half and kind of how to think about the mix of projects that are coming in? And I guess, tied to that, the Dow project is out relatively far for kind of your usual sale of gas backlog in terms of when it materializes. Can you speak to the timing or duration on the rest of the projects that you just added, and if it's -- that's more traditional and comes in over the next, whatever, one and a half to two years?
Matt White: Hey John, it's Matt. Yes. So, I would start with -- our traditional projects upon a signing announcement, usually, it's about three years. That's, I would say, is a more normalized timeframe from announcement to completion and start up. Sometimes it can be a little accelerated if you have what's called the extensive reimbursable feed where you're preordering prior to announcement with reimbursement. But for the most part, I'd say it's about a three-year on a traditional project. Clearly, with some of the large clean energy projects and Dow been one, where our scope is much larger. Hence, the amount is much larger. They tend to be a little on the longer end, more like four years plus at times just because the amount of scope we have to undertake is greater. So, to answer your question, I would say, yes, the remainder of the backlog would be more of a normalized three year on average for contribution. And some of the larger clean energy projects could be more four plus because of the magnitude of the scope. But again, it's always going to be a function of how far along we are on feed prior to signing a contract.
Sanjiv Lamba: John, I'll just add to tell you to give you comfort that these projects, and you know my view on backlog, right? A shrinking backlog is a good thing. And that's what's happening. This year, we're starting up about, I don't know, 29 to 30 projects this year. And we'll see about $1 billion of that backlog or just over $1 billion of that backlog come out. And we brought in Dow at the moment and a few other projects come back into the backlog to grow it back up. So, that's exactly how we should be thinking about backlog.
John McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is open.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. Do you expect your capital allocation split to change in 2025 or 2026. I'm just curious on the path for repurchases over the next few years, given you've added some chunkier projects in the backlog?
Matt White: Hey Patrick, it's Matt. I'll start with the capital allocation process, no, absolutely no change, right? We view that as a long-term commitment on how we're going to allocate our capital. And so from that perspective, we fully expect it to be consistent for our ownership base. Just as a reminder, for those listening in, of what our capital location policy is, I can just reiterate it. We have an underlying mandate to maintain a single A credit rating and raised the dividend every year. So, that's our underlying mandate. And after meeting that mandate, our priority is to invest in the business using our investment criteria. That's where we want to put our capital, but the projects have to meet our investment criteria. And then whatever is left over or buybacks. So we will continue to apply that approach. Clearly, as we generate more excess free cash flow, buybacks will naturally increase. But as we are seeing our sale of gas backlog rise, which it has now to the $7 billion, that means there will be more CapEx that will have deployment of capital to build these projects. We view that as a good thing. We view that as something for growth that meets our investment criteria. But from that perspective, I still right now feel our buybacks will be consistent next year with this year just because of the excess free cash flow generation. And clearly, when there are opportunities and today being one, we'll continue to take advantage of those as well.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open.
Josh Spector: Yes, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the moving parts in electronics, so strong performance year-on-year sequentially down slightly. You talked about improvement in the fourth quarter, but I'm not clear on your macro view if you're actually baking into the guidance or not. So, can you talk about what happened within the quarter and what's actually baked into your guidance? Thanks.
Sanjiv Lamba: So, the electronic sales, as you point out, Josh, are up 9% year-on-year. We've mentioned that we saw directionally electronics recovery go down the path that we had expected it to. It's maybe a little bit slower than expectations. So, from a more macro perspective, we see that in line with how expectations have been laid out. We see the investment commitments that have been broadly made by the large OEMs being in place as we look ahead to the midterm. What happened in the quarter itself, sequentially, I mean, the comment that your -- or the question that you're asking about the sequential movement. Sequentially, gas sales were up. The difference here was that we have an advanced material business, AMT or LAMT, which also serves aerospace and electronics with some components. Electronics components saw some destocking in the course of the quarter, and we certainly expect that to get normalized in Q4. Hence, the confidence we say that we will see electronics come back, solid growth sequentially because of gases continue to be on the path of recovery and seeing that normalization on inventory happened those components that we provide out of the LAMT part of the business, which actually is reported in our global other segment, I think.
Josh Spector: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, thank you and good morning. At the top of the conversation, there was a lot of discussion about potential for macroeconomic contraction. I was wondering if you could speak to company-specific or idiosyncratic sources of volume growth from your project pipeline. If we think about the project contributions over the next four or five quarters, do you think they'll be similar to the last year or so or higher or lower? And maybe you can talk about the next significant startups that you would anticipate over the next few quarters as well.
Sanjiv Lamba: So, Kevin, I'll give you a high-level view and I'll let Matt give you a little bit more color on what we think from a numbers point of view as well. So, from a high-level perspective, I'd say to you, within that project backlog are a number of secular trends. Electronics is a good example of that, that I just talked to Josh about. We see that element of the backlog continuing to provide the growth and the startups happen as we would expect. We translate that and I've said in the past, if you think about our EPS algorithm, about 1% to 3% of EPS growth will come from that backlog, and that remains consistent. I've also said previously that I expect that backlog to continue to grow. Certainly, you can see that evidence this quarter itself when we're sitting at that $10 billion number of sale of gas backlog of $7 billion plus. So, again, that backlog translates into contracted growth. We will see that come through. I also mentioned that we see startups happen in the course of the year. This year, we set about 30-odd projects being started up over $1 billion in backlog getting converted to revenues and earnings, providing that 1% to 3% of the EPS growth that I talked about. So, I think that's kind of how we are looking at the backlog, thinking about it. Some more secular, we are seeing some high-growth geographies also in our backlog converting to revenues and earnings. A good example of that are projects in India, in the more traditional end markets, which are also converting, getting started and I think helping support the EPS growth algorithm. Was there anything else, Matt, you want to add?
Matt White: I mean, I could just kind of add even further color. I think to start with our algorithm and Mike question, I mean we still -- it's fully intact. That's how we view that. And when you think about how we look at growing our EPS in this environment, I think a simplified way we think about it is three buckets. It's the management actions that we take. It's the capital allocation that we do. And it's the macro. And so when you think about capital allocation, specifically, that includes our project backlog. That includes M&A. That includes buybacks because we're talking about EPS here, so that is a use of capital. And it also would include any capital structure that we may do in terms of having synergies on either interest or tax. And so consistently, that has been 4% to 6% sort of contributory throughout the last couple of decades. And it's very stable, and it's unrelated to the macro because these are either contractually committed that are independent for the macro or it's a use of capital for the case of buybacks where ironically, it's almost countercyclical. So, when the macro gets weak, we tend to have more free cash and we have more opportunities for buybacks. So, we continue to have a high degree of confidence on that capital allocation and the stability it brings in the algorithm. And similarly, on the management actions. That tends to be mostly price less cost. It's a function of productivity. It's a function of the actions we take in every local market around the world. Obviously, getting ahead of that and having the right programs in place is important, but we continue to have a high degree of confidence in the contribution of the management actions as well. The macro is the piece that's base volumes and FX. Clearly, we're seeing the dollar strengthen here just given some of the uncertainty. And a strengthening dollar, unfortunately, usually comes with a weaker macro. And so it tends to be, I'll say, positively correlated that when you see currency headwind for us, it usually comes with weaker industrial production levels. And when you see currency tailwind, it usually comes with stronger industrial production. So, when you think about that algo right now, we are being cautious on the macro from what we're seeing looking ahead at least to the near-term, but we continue to have tremendous confidence on the contribution from our capital allocation and from the management actions that we're going to take.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. When you do a new ASU, I think of the baseload customer typically being about half the demand after you build out the Enclave. And then when you build an SMR, I think of the on-site customer being 90% plus, after you complete everything. You build an ASU and an ATR in these new projects here. Can you sell out all the excess oxygen, all of the nitrogen, the argon, and what would the original on-site customer be in one of these projects after you build everything out?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, that's a great question right at the heart of the network density conversations we tend to have in the company quite often. And I think to your point on ASUs, we normally expect our anchor customer when we put an on-site in to take up about 70% or thereabouts because that's kind of where we are able to operationally optimize the separation plan typically. And then obviously, we try and keep the balance to create the density that we need go further downstream, looking at merchant and potentially even package business and creating network density around that integrated model that we very often talk about. The example of Dow, I think, which is maybe what you're referencing over here, where we've got an ATR plus the oxygen is feeding into the ATR. So, remember, here, the surplus oxygen is quite little. There is some nitrogen available. Again, we are providing some of those atmospheric gases back to Dow as well for their consumption within their complex. So, it really is a great example of where we've been able to get the anchor customer to take a large part of the product slate. But we're also promoting density in the area, given that our established footprint in Alberta, we are able to leverage that to be able to place much, in fact, all of that product fairly quickly on the atmospheric side. We also have a little bit of extra hydrogen beyond what Dow will be taking, right? Dow was an anchor customer, and we will have surplus hydrogen, which we wanted to be able to build out the hydrogen network that we expect to have in Alberta. And in fact, my expectation is, as I referenced briefly in my prepared remarks, is that we will build on that foundation that we've got in Phase 1 of Dow to actually add capacity and build a significant hydrogen network in Alberta in the future. So, for me, in many ways, this is -- we're kind of literally building the foundation of what's going to be a very attractive network. It won't be at the same scale of what you see in the U.S. Gulf Coast, but my vision is that that's kind of directionally where we want to take the hydrogen network for Alberta as well.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Dan Rizzo: Hi, good morning. Thank you. This is actually Dan Rizzo on for Lawrence. You mentioned the second phase or the next step with Dow, what you're not committed to. But I was wondering just kind of in a broad sense, is that like a magnitude larger if it were to happen after obviously after this one is up and running?
Sanjiv Lamba: Right. So, I think there is an agreed time line over which that decision will get made. Obviously, we've done a lot of initial planning and done some thinking around how that phase will play out. That we would expect that investment to be just maybe a little bit lower than what we have in the first phase. o, as and when that decision happens over the next few years, we will hopefully see an investment of substance being put to build on the foundation that we laid in the first phase.
Dan Rizzo: Okay. And then you mentioned obviously finishing up pruning in whole health care. Given what's happening elsewhere in other regions, is there opportunity for doing some pruning or kind of divesting in other areas outside health care in different regions around the world, such as like Europe where things are fairly soft still?
Sanjiv Lamba: We're always evaluating our portfolio, and there is a lot of action that happens. Obviously, it isn't large enough for much of that to have a lot of visibility. But two pieces of that portfolio puzzle that I want to tell you about briefly. One is what we'd like to bring on to our portfolio. So tuck-in acquisitions is something that we execute on consistently every year. We have a fairly healthy opportunity pipeline in that space. And in fact, we brought on a number of those tuck-in acquisitions this year as well. So, we feel very good about the ability to bring them on to our platform, if you will, integrate them well and create value as a result of that. So, that's the incoming piece and then -- alongside that, we're constantly looking at our portfolio elements and looking at where we divest. We've done that in the past as you're aware, and you will continue to see us do that more broadly as well.
Dan Rizzo: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tony Jones with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.
Tony Jones: Hey good morning everyone and thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one to squeeze in at the end. Can I check my quick math that the new cost reduction and lift EPS by around 1% to 2%, if it all gained in 2025? And following up with that, is that incremental or will be part of the normal 4% to 5% EPS growth from price versus management actions? Thank you.
Matt White: Tony, it's Matt. I'll start with -- we expect this to be roughly a 1-year return, so you could do the math on that. And as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the full run rate to take effect in the second half of next year. So, based on that, you won't get the full benefit in 2025, but we would anticipate a majority of the benefit to be in 2025. When you think about -- this action clearly is incremental. This is something we feel we need to take. It is a bottoms-up approach. So, each market aligned with what they're seeing in their respective regions and adjusting their cost accordingly. But we view this all part of this management action effort that we need to do to get ahead of this environment. So, clearly, we see it as beneficial. We see it in incremental to next year, but this is all part of the effort we need to undertake, as I mentioned earlier, because our outlook on the macro is a bit weaker. And so we view we need to make it up in some other areas on which management actions would be one.
Tony Jones: Thank you, Matt. That’s very helpful.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. You mentioned that big ticket purchases have been a little bit sluggish due to economic uncertainty. Can you comment on what you've seen in hard goods and equipment and automation demand in North America or other regions? And I'm curious, have you seen any change in customer behavior in response to lower interest rates?
Sanjiv Lamba: So, Mike, let's talk about the hard goods business first and then we talk about interest rates. The biggest hard goods market for us really is here in the U.S. And this is a trend we track very closely. As you've heard me say previously, I think of it as a bit of a leading indicator. We are right in the middle of the industrial weakness that we've referenced a number of times in this call because the hard goods numbers are actually reflecting that. We see about mid-single-digit declines on hard good sales. Now, that is split. And to your point, there are some -- when we think about that sequentially, there are some large automation purchases that swung one quarter to the other. So, that I think does kind of change the numbers a little bit. But there is an underlying weakness on the hard goods side, I think, which is reflective of the industrial weakness we described more broadly across the manufacturing sector in particular. And that's consistent with what we are seeing on hard goods elsewhere in the world as well, although our largest market is the U.S., as I mentioned to you. And reference to also the large ticket items that I think which ties in with your question on consumer behavior is that people across the world -- and I think I'll talk about the rest of the world and then I'll come to the U.S. market briefly. People across the world are finding that there isn't the propensity to spend and decisions on large spend items just isn't happening as you would normally have expected. And that's particularly true of places like China, where consumer sentiment, obviously, is down and a little bit of Europe as well where people see that economic weakness and recognize that there isn't a that's going to change that in the near-term. So there is a degree of more caution that's reflected over that. Hey, the consumer sentiment and behavior in the U.S. has been phenomenal. I think the economy has benefited tremendously from that. Obviously, we are seeing signals of some concerns around that, including some if you think about auto loans and other areas where delinquencies are on the rise. But we're not seeing anything to suggest that in anticipation of the Fed's actions that sentiment is -- it becomes a lot more bullish. We haven't seen that. Don't see that just yet. If anything, I think the consumer behavior does seem like it's tightening a little bit. But I'm happy to be proven wrong, and we'll see how this quarter plays out.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Abby, thanks again for a great job today. Everyone else, thank you for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out. Have a very productive day. Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Linde Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And after the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. I'd now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Adam, thank you. Good morning, everyone and thanks for attending our 2024 second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks and then Matt will give an update on Linde's second quarter financial performance and outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan and a very good morning, everyone. Linde employees once again delivered high-quality growth despite the stagnant trends of global industrial activity. Second quarter EPS of $3.85, operating margins of 29.3% and return on capital of 25.7% all reached new highs, driven by the unwavering efforts of our 66,000 employees who actively manage what we can control. Turning to volume trends; you'll notice we were flat year-on-year. Last quarter, we described potential challenges in the industrial macro. And for the most part, it has played out as expected. This is why we initiated the self-help actions which enable us to create shareholder value in any environment. That being said, the current quarter experienced a 3% sequential volume growth. And while some of this relates to seasonality, certain regions had organic volume improvements. While this is a positive sign, we are still not assuming any meaningful economic recovery in the guidance. Some may view this as overly cautious. But given the uncertain environment, I believe it's prudent to take this approach. As you know, when industrial activity recovers, our network density will enable us to supply that additional volume to our existing and new customers. Until then, we will continue with disciplined pricing and proactive actions to ensure earnings growth in this environment. Slide 3 provides more color on end market growth trends. Starting with consumer-related end markets, food and beverage continues the strong resilient growth trend at 8% over prior year, in part attributed to Linde's total systems approach. This includes growing demand for higher quality and more innovative frozen foods, food packaging safety and dry ice for meal delivery services as consumers opt for convenience meals. In addition, beverage carbonation and associated services continue to grow as consumers dine out. Our electronics sales represent 9% of our consolidated sales. But there's a substantial portion of our 50% nonconsolidated JVs that supply this end market and are not included in this number, primarily in Taiwan. The 7% growth sequentially and year-over-year was driven by a combination of project backlog start-ups and base growth in the U.S. and Asia. In the U.S., we started up our Phase 1 supply system in Phoenix, Arizona for TSMC. Due to this, more than half of this project CapEx has now been removed from the backlog, driving the slight net decline versus prior quarter. I've always said that a healthy project backlog is one that turns over frequently with projects starting on time, contributing to earnings as per contract. In addition, base volumes improved moderately in the U.S., China and Korea. As you know from the last quarter, we signaled this was possible. So I'm encouraged to see volumes -- volume levels starting to recover now. Healthcare is down 1% from prior year and flat sequentially. Consistent with last quarter, this is primarily due to our efforts to continue rationalizing home care products and service offerings that don't meet the business criteria, especially in the United States. We still anticipate the underlying demographic trends to drive mid-single-digit percent growth but some of the ongoing portfolio pruning will partially offset that. Turning now to the industrial end markets; chemicals and energy grew 5% from North American activity, primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast, hydrogen as well as Mexican energy services. We supply some of the most cost-competitive customers in the world and their higher production rates reflect their share of the global market. Looking forward, this end market will likely be the largest beneficiary of the project backlog, especially around clean energy projects. While OCI represents just one example, there are several more that comprise the $8 billion to $10 billion of near-term pipeline opportunities which we are pursuing and making good progress. Metals and mining is slightly down year-over-year, mainly from North American steel volumes which have decreased, primarily serving the automotive and construction markets. This is a normal cycle we've seen over the years, not unexpected, although there could be some future growth opportunities as more infrastructure and energy projects break ground. Finally, the manufacturing end market is trending up 4%, primarily on pricing actions as volumes are fairly steady across most geographies. Aside from some specific manufacturing sectors like aerospace or battery production, this end market mostly coincides with global industrial production which remains flat. Overall, Linde employees continue to do what they do best, manage an industrial gas business with leading results that create value for our shareholders regardless of the economic climate. Despite the challenging conditions, Linde delivered high-quality growth, executed on $8 billion project backlog and further positioned the company for future growth. I remain confident in Linde's ability to successfully navigate the near-term uncertainty while ensuring longer-term leading performance that our owners expect. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through our financial results.
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Slide 4 provides consolidated results for the second quarter. Sales of $8.3 billion were up 1% from last year and 2% sequentially. Foreign currency and cost pass-through, both continue to present headwinds at minus 3% year-over-year and minus 2% from the first quarter. As a reminder, contractual cost pass-through is simply the energy cost variance we bill to on-site customers and thus has no impact to operating profit dollars. Furthermore, FX translation likely will remain a headwind as the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against the majority of foreign currencies. Excluding these items, organic sales are up 3% over last year and 4% sequentially. Pricing trends continue to follow globally weighted inflation with the strongest contribution from Americas and EMEA. APAC levels are more stable as lower helium prices mostly offset increases from the remaining countries with no contribution from China due to deflationary conditions. Volume was flat from 2023 as growth from the project backlog was offset by weaker base volumes. As Sanjiv mentioned, we did experience a sequential volume improvement of 3% from a combination of project start-ups, organic growth and seasonality. Time will tell if the organic growth trend persists. But for now we are excluding any further improvement in the earnings guidance. Operating profit of $2.4 billion grew 6%, resulting in an operating margin of 29.3%; all gas segments expanded margins year-over-year and sequentially, with EMEA leading at 33.7%. As we stated many times, each segment has opportunities to improve margins and there are no structural reasons why laggards cannot converge to the current leader over time. EPS of $3.85 increased 8% or 10% when excluding the 2% FX headwind. Further details of cash flow and capital allocation can be found on Slide 5. You can see the operating cash flow trend to the left, including this quarter's $1.9 billion which is 10% below last year. The primary driver relates to unfavorable timing of our engineering project prepayments. When you look at the face of the cash flow statement, you can see that contract assets and liabilities which represents these project prepayments are unfavorable more than $300 million. This quarter-to-quarter volatility is a normal part of the engineering project cycle. Aside from the engineering projects, we are seeing more seasonal effects on interest and tax payments. We have significantly more euro bond cash payments which are once per year as well as cash tax payments in the first half of the year. This will result in more back-end loaded operating cash flow, similar to last year. Overall, I remain quite confident on cash generation of the gas business but I do expect continued volatility regarding timing of customer prepayments for engineering projects. As far as capital allocation, year-to-date, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders and invested $2.3 billion into the business. Regardless of the economic climate, we'll continue to adhere to our time-tested capital policy of an underlying mandate to maintain a single A credit rating while raising the dividend every year, a priority to invest back into the business subject to our long-term investment criteria and a commitment to sweep remaining funds toward stock repurchases. I'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. For the third quarter, we're providing an EPS guidance range of $3.82 to $3.92 or 6% to 9% growth when excluding a 1% FX headwind. Consistent with prior quarters, this assumes no economic improvement at the midpoint. The updated full year range is now $15.40 to $15.60 or 9% to 11% growth when excluding a 1% FX headwind. For the full year, we simply raised the prior guidance range by $0.10 on the bottom end, while leaving the top end as is. Consistent with statements last quarter, we have not seen enough encouraging signs to be bullish on the second half economic activity. So we are essentially leaving the guide intact while raising the bottom end for our recent Q2 performance. Rest assured, if the economy does better, we'll capture that incremental benefit. And if it does worse, we will take actions to mitigate the impact to earnings. Here at Linde, we have a culture to plan for the worst but hope for the best. Employees around the world have been taking proactive measures to ensure we can deliver on our commitments regardless of the economy. This disciplined operating rhythm coupled with our relentless focus to create shareholder value, gives us confidence to, once again, weather the uncertainty and maintain industry-leading results. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Leithead of Barclays.
Michael Leithead: Great. Big picture question, just when we look at your results and your peers, it doesn't seem like there's much industrial gas demand out there right now. And Linde has done a great job in the past, say, few years of continuing to grow earnings double digit despite that, in large part, some of the self-help actions that you've taken. I guess if we're stuck in this no-growth environment for or a bit or near term and we're already at a pretty efficient baseline, can you just talk through your confidence and how you expect to continue driving 10%-plus earnings growth just in this macro backdrop?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Mike. You're right. I think the macro isn't really very supportive at this point in time. What I'd like to suggest is you go back maybe 4 or 5 quarters now, we've seen the macro environment reflect that. In fact, over that period, we've seen what I call industrial recession. While people debate around what the GDP does or doesn't, we are very focused on what the industrial production index is doing. And we've seen industrial recession over that period and we've managed right through that to not only deliver that EPS growth that you just referenced but also consistently ensure that our organization is ready to take the actions ahead of the curve in most cases, as we see these indices. One of the good things we have is our ability to see across different end markets and geographies and to take action quickly. So I think that in part is the reason we are where we are today, delivering on that EPS growth consistently over an extended period of time. My view is that is exactly the MO that you will expect from us going forward as well. It's something that we have understood well. We have a good -- it's a muscle that we know how to flex well and I think you'll see that play out. I'll take you right to the EPS algorithm that we've spoken about a lot in the past, Mike and I think that's what gives us confidence that we will be able to continue to provide that 10-plus percent EPS growth through most economic environments, if not all. So I'll recap that for you. There are 4 contributors to how we get to that 10-plus percent EPS growth. The first, backlog. That backlog and the start-ups that are happening and you know we've been consistent in starting up the backlog. Those start-ups contribute anywhere between 1% to 2% of our EPS growth. Backlog is trending up and I expect to see that 1% to 2% contribution to trend up alongside that. The next factor is what we are -- what we practice every day. This is pricing and productivity. We've explained this in a lot of detail to you guys. I won't kind of recap all of it. But to say that we expect about more than half of that EPS growth to come from proactive management actions related to pricing and productivity. So about 4% to 6% of that EPS growth comes and contributed from pricing and productivity. Next, volume. And obviously, at this point in time, you've heard us say that our guidance has 0 volume assumed at the midpoint. So if there is a volume uptick, even a little bit of a tailwind on industrial activity, obviously, we will pick that up and there's a multiplier effect that you've seen. We've demonstrated that in 2021. We constantly remind people that even with a little bit of a rebound on the industrial side, we were able to deliver 30% EPS growth in that year. But in the absence of that, our algorithms still suggests with 0 contribution, we will continue to deliver that 10-plus percent EPS growth. And last but not least, we have a lot of cash that we generate. Surplus cash after investing in the business is swept into share buybacks and they contribute about 2% of that EPS growth. Put that together, that 10-plus percent EPS growth, I can say with a high degree of confidence is where we stand in terms of our business for this year and going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Sanjiv and Matt, the sequential volume growth of 3% in the quarter was positive. The volume comparison in Q3 is not hard, maybe even easy, at minus 2%. So why wouldn't we see volume growth for Linde in Q3 year-over-year?
Matt White: David, it's Matt. I think to your exact point, we absolutely see the comps getting easier in the back half. So on a year-over-year basis, you might see neutral to positive just because the prior year comp is a little easier. But our view of no macro improvement that we're laying out is more on a sequential basis. So to your exact point, even if you see little to no macro improvement sequentially, it still could result in potentially neutral to positive year-on-year just because of the comps that you're up against. So the comps do get easier in the back half. That's absolutely correct on a year-over-year basis. But we're taking our standard approach which is on a forward-looking sequential basis, assume no economic pick-up and then we'll just need to manage to the reality of whatever happens, good or bad.
David Begleiter: And just one more question. The order intake was the lowest, I think, since Q2 2020 at $300 million. I know it's lumpy but is bidding activity lower or less than it was 6 or 12 months ago?
Sanjiv Lamba: David, our folks in engineering are very busy and there is a lot of front-end work currently that is happening around studies, FEEDs and so on and so forth. So we're seeing activity at the front end being very, very busy. What we are seeing at the moment and the delay tends to be moving from that front-end activity which is whether it's a FEED or a study to actually getting to FID. And we certainly see customers taking a little bit longer to getting to that FID piece. So a lot of activity isn't translating just yet to FIDs. We've said this before in the last call as well, we are seeing people taking a little more time before they get to an FID decision on some of these large projects.
Operator: Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.
Duffy Fischer: Can we dig in a little bit on healthcare? Again, traditionally, you think about healthcare kind of growing year in and year out a little bit, how much pruning do you have left, roughly how much of the portfolio needs to go away? When do you think that's done? And then when you get to that mid-single digits, what's the breakdown of that price versus volume? And can you recoup inflation in that business like you can in your other businesses?
Sanjiv Lamba: All right, Duffy. So let me first explain what's happening with the pruning, then we'll talk a little bit about how the growth around healthcare happens. So as far as pruning is concerned, we have been looking at that portfolio. We've been acting on it. You've heard us speak about it in the last quarter. Those actions continue. My expectation is by the end of the year, you will see some of those actions getting lapped out. So that's what you should be thinking about. Long term -- mid- to long term, I'd say demographics will support that mid-single-digit expectation of healthcare growth. We see that currently on par and that demographics obviously drive both the hospital care which is obviously a large part of our business as well as the home care business which is in some selected geographies where we operate. As far as inflation is concerned, this is a business that relies enormously on productivity actions and therefore, we always find that inflation and productivity will have to go hand in hand for us to get the pricing that we need and keep that business at an attractive margin level.
Operator: Our next question is from Peter Clark with Bernstein.
Peter Clark: Two questions but was sort of one related but it's -- on the ExxonMobil contract that Air Liquide announced. Obviously, one of the things that getting to the return hurdle is the big ramp in argon merchant where they're claiming 50% increasing their merchant availability. I know it's not [indiscernible]. I know it could be 4 years-plus away. But what sort of impact could that have just in the market, I know argon has been tight but it's quite a slug of capacity that would come pretty quickly. And related to that, obviously, part of that deal they're allowing access to the pipelines. They've probably got capability to do that. I think you probably sold out a bit more than them on your Gulf Coast pipelines. But is that something you would consider in some regions, access to pipeline for the right sort of contracts? Those are the 2 questions.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you, Peter. So as you know, the U.S. market is one of our largest merchant markets and therefore, there is current growth in demand on the demand side. In fact, we are actually putting in some capacity as well. And we see the market remaining short on argon for an extended period of time. So from my perspective -- obviously, what Air Liquide has done with their economics is something you need to ask them. But from our perspective, it's a stable market. There is growth in the market. The molecules get absorbed fairly quickly. Our view of the market continues to be fairly bullish. And I expect product as it comes on, will get placed in the market at a reasonable pace. As far as pipeline access is concerned, I'll just give you our view. I'm not going to try and comment on what the strategy or the view from Air Liquide might be. From our perspective, we have over a period of maybe 3 or 4 decades now developed a very significant pipeline network that underpins significantly the kind of business and growth that we've developed in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We see that pipeline network as being critical to continue to deliver growth through that very network in that very exciting part of the world where we see growth particularly as it's driven in the future with low carbon hydrogen developments as well. So for us, in many ways, our competitive advantage lies in the infrastructure that we've invested in and developed over 3 decades and we want to fully leverage that infrastructure as we did with the OCI project to make sure that we continue to win and actually grow that business significantly. I remain very bullish on the opportunities I see in the U.S. Gulf Coast and I see us developing and actually developing that infrastructure further, building further caverns as an example, something that we are progressing with and using that for future growth.
Peter Clark: You didn't surprise me with your answers.
Sanjiv Lamba: That's good, Peter. Consistency is what we strive for.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: I don't ordinarily think of your business as being interest rate sensitive but we have had an unprecedented increase in rates in a short period of time and now it seems like we're pivoting to a decrease in rates. So wondering just what your thoughts are on -- if we assume rates come down over the balance of this year and through next year, will that change your macro outlook at all? And do you think it will change your customers' behavior in terms of their ability or desire to move forward on FID projects they would work with you on?
Sanjiv Lamba: Vince, I'm going to let Matt talk to you about this, it's a topic he's very passionate about and then I'll maybe add to that. Go ahead, Matt.
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Obviously, as you know, Vince, it's speculation at this point, nobody knows for certain but obviously, we have an opinion like everyone else. And to your point, I mean, my personal opinion on this is as interest rates rose rapidly, the area that was affected most were large durable goods, large capital deployments, so our customers that may enter into that area. Even when you think about something like the consumer home loans, auto loans, those, in some cases, effectively doubled and changed the dynamic on that purchasing power of those more durable goods which tend to have more plastics in them, more metals, more glass, cement, the kind of more industrial infrastructure you tend to see. And therefore, I think this, in my opinion, was a driver of the very weak industrial production PMI numbers you've seen over the last 18-plus months, as Sanjiv mentioned. To some extent, in many countries in the world, we've been in an industrial recession. And I believe those customers that were affected by that were the more interest rate sensitive. I think on top of that, you add, I would argue, probably a little bit less government infrastructure spend than what you normally see because a lot of it was tied up more in various incentive packages that needed a lot of clarity. And so that clarity -- lack of clarity stretched these out. Conversely, the consumer was stronger throughout that time in noninterest sensitive areas of consumption, services. But at least based on what I'm seeing now, it seems like that aspect of the consumer is starting to slow. So in theory, what's possible, maybe you start to see GDP contract which then would actually define a real recession. And at that point, to your exact point, if interest rates decline, hopefully, what that could do is thaw out some of the durables, some of the larger capital-intensive purchases and start to help that environment because what we're seeing today on some of these projects, the customers are committed, they want to do it but the CapEx costs are high. And I think that's a function of the inflation. That's a function of the rates working their way through. If that were to reverse, it could probably bring a little more stability and a little more reasonable pricing which I think could cause some projects to finally clear the FID and sign the contract. So it's speculative, right? Nobody knows for certain but that's how I would at least view it at this stage. And I would view it as positive with the lower rates to try and move some of these projects over the final signature hurdle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Favre with BNP Paribas.
Laurent Favre: My question is around electronics. Sanjiv, you mentioned that TSMC start up and I was thinking that we haven't seen any announcements of new projects in electronics in a while. So I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunity from here for new projects? And also, if there's anything you can see or say on the incremental opportunity from AI and data centers?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Laurent. So -- both of those questions are excellent and something that we kind of referenced in the last call just saying that, look, we were seeing a build-up of some early signals around the recovery in electronics, I'd say to you that we have seen that in the course of the quarter. But these are early signals. There is still more to happen in the course of the balance of this year. Let's talk a little bit about projects now. So we started our Phase 1 of TSMC in Phoenix. We are very advanced in our build on the Samsung project in Taylor, Texas. And we're building a number of other plants, some for Intel, around the world as well. We also see growth going back in terms of the Asian demand, we're also seeing growth in the Asian demand starting to pick up and new projects getting announced there as well. So over time, as these projects get signed up and contracted, as you know, we have a very high level of discipline around what we will announce but you will see announcements reflecting a number of these investments that we would make as those contracts get signed up. I expect electronics will continue to see momentum in terms of new investments, new fab capacity. And to your point, this will be driven in part by large data requirements also driven by AI requirements. I know AI had the hype, the shine is off a little bit at the moment. But the reality is AI will prove to be a tool that will be significantly and, in some cases, transformative for industries and markets and you will see investment underpinning that coming through data centers, helped and supported then by chip production that happens out of the fabs. So I still expect that that momentum will be there. I still expect the large majors -- large major semiconductor manufacturers to continue to make that investment. Obviously, there are some that are kind of seeing some short-term challenges, including some news today that you would have seen. But the long-term outlook remains very robust and we continue to be very well positioned to win more than our fair share in that space.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Matt, you mentioned in your remarks about the challenges in helium in your Asia Pac business. Just curious whether that is stabilizing? Or do you see further erosion in either pricing or volumes there? And perhaps it would more broadly, can you talk about your helium fundamentals in the other regions? Are they quite different from the impact from this Russian supply? And what exactly is the portion that is in your corporate segment? I assume that's some kind of export volume. Perhaps you can highlight what exactly is the driver there?
Matt White: Sure, Steve. I think on a couple of things just for some baseline data. So helium is low single-digit percent of our global sales, just to put in perspective the component that it makes up for us. Furthermore, to your point, helium is one of the very, very few molecules that is truly global pricing, supply-demand driven. As you know, the vast majority of our project -- our products price to inflation contractually but helium is a difference as it is more supply-demand driven, given the nature of that molecule. So with that as the backdrop, I think to your point, you are seeing different regional aspects of pricing with APAC seeing the most pressure from this Russian supply. Now we have no participation in that Russian supply. We are not using Russian supply. We cancelled that contract per our allowance a couple of years ago. So from that perspective, it is finding its way primarily into China. But as you can imagine, APAC is a larger consumer of helium primarily because of the electronics sector. So given the electronics sector in certain parts, especially like Korea, maybe a little slower, coupled with this Russian supply, it definitely created some pricing pressure. I would say now it is stabilizing but it's something you still got to keep an eye on. But the way we always think about this and it's been true in this business going back decades, is you have to have a significant diversity of supply, you have to have all supply modes to move the molecules and you have to have a very robust global business across all end markets. And when you have all those things, it gives you much more stability and a healthy business. And that always has been the case for us and I expect it will always continue to be the case. As far as the helium component of the other segment, just to clarify what that is. So given helium is more of a global business, we sell it intercompany to all of the gas segments since we operate it as a single global business. So the intercompany transfer pricing aspect is what we show in the other segment. So that will just be at a cost plus transfer price that's eliminated. And the actual majority of the helium profit will be represented in each of the gas segments. So it tends to be somewhat stable with the one exception that as you see swings, in the cost of helium, up or down that will reflect more in the other segment, whereas pricing dynamics tend to reflect more in the gas segments, the geographic gas segments for the end market pricing. So that's how to think about that just as -- in terms of how we structured our segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Just curious, Sanjiv, if you think about the ISM and stuff, it didn't look really great the last couple of days. What if things get worse sequentially into the third and the fourth? How do you think your portfolio will or strategy will change? And how does that sort of change the maybe order backlogs and stuff?
Sanjiv Lamba: All right, Mike. So maybe I'll break that up into a couple of different conversations. Let's talk about the business itself. And I think you'll recall, Mike, we had a conversation a few quarters ago when we described the profile of our business as being defensive. And I think in that -- in doing that, we had explained that a combination of factors ensures that we have the robustness and the resilience that sits in the business portfolio that we have. So part of that we said was obviously our contracted on-site business, as we've seen through some difficult -- the period of energy crisis in Europe, as an example, that, that's held really well. Contracts have been honored. And I think that defensiveness of that and the resilience has shown through in many ways. So that's one part of the defensive nature of our business. The other is the resilient end markets that we supply which are not prone to manufacturing PMIs and so on and so forth, being food and beverage. Again, you saw that 8% year-on-year growth in food and beverage and I expect to see continued growth in that segment as well. In addition to that healthcare which we are now kind of sorting out some of the portfolio issues but underlying healthcare, mid-single-digit growth expectations going forward, that resilience will continue to be there. Again, secular in many ways, of what happens to manufacturing and industrial activity. So that portion of supplies to the resilient business. Add to that, we have contracted rental streams that come in, in respect again, of activity levels. You form all of that together, you've got a business where nearly 3/4 of our business is contracted in or locked in through these various mechanisms, keeping that defensive nature. In respect of what happens to the industrial activity and manufacturing PMI that everyone is referencing at the moment, the reality is that defensive nature will continue to be very resilient as we move forward. The other part of your question was what happens to backlog, right? And again, I just want to say, backlog is $7.9 billion. We're working our way through that. We're starting up this year, between $1.5 billion to $2 billion worth of projects in the first half itself, more than -- about half of that has already been done. So that backlog is contracted growth. Usually, it's date certain. So irrespective of what is happening with the customers' project, we get a stream of revenues through that project coming through and we see that as a very robust part of our future growth plans which are locked in and contracted and we feel really good about the quality of that backlog that we're currently executing. And as I said before, backlog is -- as an example, this quarter itself, we started off the TSMC Phase 1 project and that's going to start contributing to earnings based on the contracts that we have. So again, a very resilient part of that. So I think, you look at that, I think that kind of gives you a flavor of what we're looking ahead to in terms of how we think about resilience underpinning the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS.
Josh Spector: I was wondering if you could talk about pricing specifically in the Americas. I think it's been a source of strength for you guys and some of your competitors that have reported. So just curious, one, if that's more of a U.S. phenomenon or if that's more South or Central America where you're getting more pricing? And two, I guess, with energy prices semi-stable, demand kind of semi-stable what's driving some of that sequential acceleration in pricing within the region?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Josh. So again, I think pricing is -- and we've said this a number of times before, Josh, I'm just going to maybe go back and recap that very briefly. We've said, if you go back and look at the long-term pricing trend, we track or are slightly ahead of globally weighted CPI for us. That trend has been consistent over an extended period. I go back 15, 20 years. We've demonstrated positive pricing across that period aligned with what we think global CPI has done. And that is actually a great proxy to think about how we continue to see pricing going forward. So, I want to just -- as you're thinking about pricing and as you're looking ahead, I want you to just keep that in mind because that I think in truth is really where our pricing efforts will continue to yield results going forward. Now, pricing continues to be robust in the Americas, I think we are seeing positive pricing both in the U.S. as well as in our Latin American businesses. And this, again, the trend itself is not inconsistent. It's a trend that we've been able to -- we have seen through the course of the last many quarters and in fact, consistently proven over the last 5 years as well. So again, there's nothing happening over there that's exceptional. All we're doing is -- management action drives pricing is how we think about it. And I think management action is driving the pricing efforts that we see in the Americas at the moment. Both Americas and EMEA are tracking globally weighted or weighted CPI for their respective regions. In APAC, I would say to you that I think we're finding pricing a little bit shorter at this point in time and that's where currently the push is to make sure that we get that over the line. Obviously, China is in deflation, so that doesn't help. But again, we've got pricing efforts continuing in that space as well.
Josh Spector: Okay. I mean that's helpful. I guess maybe one more follow-up around that is just so when I think about CPI and that being something to look towards, again, I guess, focusing on the Americas, I mean with your mix, your pricing is up, call it, mid-single digit year-over-year in Americas and maybe it's up, I don't know, 3% to 4% on a merchant level sequentially, I guess what CPI indicator is going up at that rate on a quarter-over-quarter basis?
Matt White: Yes. Sure, Josh. It's Matt. I think you have to remember, when you think about Americas, you have all of South America, to your point which we have leading positions in just about every country there. So whether it's Brazil or Central America, like Mexico, other countries in South America, Argentina, you've got Chile, Colombia, you are continuing to see inflation rates that are much higher than what you would see in a U.S. scenario. So that is all aligned and relative to that and something we do track consistently. I mean, as you well know, just look at recently the devaluations you've seen across a wide basket of LatAm currencies and that is being offset through higher inflation local in these countries. So it is driving that. It is part of that. Now, at times, yes, you may see some different quarter-to-quarter sequential variances just because on the timing, the pricing goes through to inflation that could create a little bit of a noise. But when we look at the CPI tracking, we tend to look at it on an annualized basis because that's a little bit cleaner on timing. But as Sanjiv said, it continues to track quite closely. It's something that we look at country by country. And when you look at the balance of inflation levels you're seeing, especially in LatAm, they continue to be elevated, especially vis-à-vis a country like U.S. or a region like Europe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: I think a couple of years ago, you talked about a $3 billion investment opportunity to decarbonize Linde and I think the direction was to produce more blue hydrogen, to change over to ATRs or change or SMRs. Have you -- how much have you invested? And does that $3 billion number still look good? Have things been stretched out at time? Are they according to plan?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you, Jeff. So yes, we had laid out our decarbonization strategy and road map, if you will. And as part of that, we said there were 3 levers. The first lever was -- and this is out of a $50 billion investment over 10 years. We've said in the past. First lever was decarbonizing our own operations with that $3 billion estimate at that point in time. We said a bulk of our deployment would be enabling our customers to decarbonize which is the second pillar. And the third pillar was just some new opportunities for hydrogen to act as an energy vector and for export purposes, etcetera. The first pillar which is what -- which you are referring to at the moment, is where a lot of our work at the moment is happening. As you know, we have a large fleet of steam methane reformers or SMRs in the U.S. Gulf Coast. They are part of that network that connects that 500 miles of pipeline that we have and serves between 60 to 80 very large customers for their hydrogen requirements. And we are currently in various stages of FEED studies for those SMRs to understand the best opportunity for us to do decarbonization. On the SMRs, technically speaking, there are different ways to do that. We can do post-combustion capture. We can do syngas capture. The FEED studies are ongoing at this point in time. My view is that we will actually progress with those probably over the next few years. They are in line and on track with our 2035 targets that we set for ourselves. And I expect to see those business cases be developed as we get to a more technical conclusion as far as our FEED study is concerned. Whether that's $3 billion or more, I think the FEED will tell us that. So I think we'll wait for the FEEDs to come through. But order of magnitude, I'd say to you, that's in about the right ballpark.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And then quickly, I realize that your volumes in the United States year-over-year were flat. But if you had to -- I'm sorry, in the Americas. But if you had to break it up into packaged, merchant and on-site and compare the volume changes, what would they look like for the second quarter?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Jeff, why don't I just talk a little bit about what we're seeing in Americas. I think this is a good lead into that because I think it will give you a flavor of where the volumes are. I think hopefully answer your question as well. So I'll start off by just saying that the U.S. market has been incredibly resilient, right? I mean it surprised most people. But we are now seeing industrial activity being more sluggish, it is reflecting the softer demand growth that is there in the marketplace. And obviously, everyone's quoting the PMI, etcetera. In the last quarter itself, we referenced that we were starting to see that sluggishness in the market. So an exception to that -- a notable exception to that is hydrogen demand. Hydrogen volumes are at very high levels and I expect them to remain strong for the rest of the year. So again, that is a reflection of what's happening in the chemicals and energy space. And again, the on-site piece which I think you were querying is -- one of the key elements of that comes out of those HyCO volumes that we've seen. The other indicator that I watch carefully is the hard goods out of the U.S. packaged business. You heard me say before, I consider hard goods a leading indicator of what is happening in manufacturing and industrial activity. Again, during this quarter, we saw hard good sales decline year-over-year in the low single digits, a clear indicator that you're seeing softer manufacturing environment, I expect that to continue for the next couple of quarters at least. Now, hard goods were sequentially flat, though. So I think it wasn't that you were seeing sequential worsening but you were seeing softer year-on-year movements as far as hard goods were concerned. Again, that gives you an indication what's happening around our packaged business. I would say that between those 2, I mean, that's a fair view of where we are seeing that volumes play out in terms of what we see between on-site merchant and packaged.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citigroup.
Eric Zhang: This is Eric Zhang on for Patrick. Deflationary conditions in China continue to be an issue. Can you talk about the cost actions you're taking in the region? And how has pricing trended?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So I'll begin by just kind of reminding you that in China, we serve some of the Tier 1 customers who tend to have the best cost position in their fields and have been quite stable through this downturn. So I think it's -- just as a starting point, having a high-quality customer in China actually is very, very important for the stability and performance of that business. If I talk specifically about cost actions, I'll say to you, you could probably go back, I'd say, about 18 months now when we first talked about concerns around growth in China and the fact that we were treating China business as a mature business and ramping up activities both on cost management around the fixed cost base and enhancing productivity actions as well. And that's been ongoing for about 18 months. It isn't new. We are not acting on it now. We have been undertaking this and using this as an opportunity to reset the cost base in China. Much of that action has already been completed. I feel pretty good about where we stand with the cost base. There is obviously more we can do and the productivity programs we are running in China, leveraging AI and so on and so forth are good examples of how we are managing that. I'll give you one very simple example. So most companies in China, most operations in China, for instance, following recent regulatory requirements have had to recruit between 1 to 5 safety officers to go and walk around the plant and take readings and record them so that the authorities can come and audit them. Now, most of the companies have done that. As you would expect Linde thought long and hard about how best to accomplish that. And at the moment, we are rolling out a program called Smart Plants where we're using a combination of drones and robots to do much of this reading of gauges and pressure points within the plant to make sure that they are then automatically recorded. So that's a productivity project, where we've used technology, created a digital solution and applied that broadly across our fleet of plants in China. Clear productivity benefits, you obviously don't increase your FTEs or your employee cost as a result of doing that. That's just one example of many that I'd give you in terms of the actions that are being taken which are both smart but also addressing the cost base itself quite significantly. On pricing, China is in deflation. So pricing -- if we say we want to kind of keep ourselves at that 2% mark that we'd like to see happen, that's where the team is currently pushing to try and get pricing to continue to move up. There are 2 elements to the pricing. On the industrials, merchant and packaged in particular, we are seeing positive pricing movement there. It is, however, being offset by lower pricing on helium and rare gases, partly driven by lower demand from the electronics segment and partly because we are obviously seeing pressure of helium coming in from Russia into China which has made China long on helium and has had an impact on pricing there. But beyond that, industrial pricing, action continues to be strong and I feel good about the momentum that the team has got over there and we'll continue to see that move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: A few questions on capital deployment for Matt. Your pace of repurchases accelerated a bit in the quarter. And in the prepared remarks, I think you talked about a potential harvest of some project prepays in the back half of the year. So could you comment on the likely glide path of repurchases that you would foresee in coming quarters and maybe contrast that with potential for bolt-on deal activity within the guardrails of your single A rating?
Matt White: Sure, Kevin. I think obviously, I stated our capital allocation policy which you know well in the prepared remarks and that's been consistent going back many, many years and we expect it to remain consistent. And within that, repurchases are absolutely an integral part of that. And it's something that we expect to be every day in the market. To your point, we have a significant amount of room on the single A rating. That's obvious given our metrics where they stand right now. And I do expect, as I mentioned, to see a fairly nice pick-up in operating cash flow in the back half of this year, just given some of the timing of things that are going to be better in the back half than they were in the first half. But that all being said, our repurchase plan will look out generally for four quarters forward. We will determine a number that we want to deploy in cash based on the capital allocation policy. And then we'll execute inside the quarter and sometimes we'll accelerate when we see opportunities in the stock. And we definitely saw that this last quarter. So we did accelerate and we repurchased $1.4 billion recently and we got good execution and we felt good pricing. So the overall plan will continue to be part of the equation and our cash and our capital allocation. But day to day, we will accelerate or change our patterns based on what we see in the market. And as you know, we did that back during the COVID times, we did that back during the great financial crisis, where we saw some significant opportunities to come in. And if we see anything like that, again, we absolutely will take advantage of it going forward.
Kevin McCarthy: And any thought on bolt-on deal potential?
Matt White: For M&A, I mean that's something we're always going to be evaluating for tuck-ins. You could see here in our recent cash flow statement that we had out here that we did do -- continued more M&A activity. It will mostly be probably North America, maybe some in our APAC packaged gas business. These are great tuck-ins. They are justified on synergies. So they have a very low risk threshold. And I think that's something between that and decaps, we are seeing more decap opportunities but our investment criteria for them remains the same. So we'll see if opportunities present themselves with our Tier 1 customers but that's a consistent aspect of our capital allocation policy to invest back in the business with our investment criteria and M&A is absolutely part of that.
Operator: We will now take our final question from John Roberts with Mizuho.
John Roberts: Matt, I think you've talked before about return on invested capital plateauing here. Does it stay high or maybe even drift a little higher as long as earnings are driven by productivity in the consumer-based markets? And then when the cyclical markets start to recover and the energy transition investments come in, it starts to come down? Or do you think it plateaus high here, even when cyclicals do start to come back and the energy transition investments come in?
Matt White: Yes. Sure, John. I think to your point, look, when you look at both our margins and our return on capital, we have industry leading. In the case of return on capital, probably 2x or more to the next competitor. So the way we view that is we want to continue to grow and grow quality which means maintain or potentially improve some of the margins and ROC while growing and growing in high quality. Obviously, margins, as I mentioned, we have more room. We have room in each segment. We view them eventually converging. And so that opportunity we'll continue to take advantage of. On the ROC, you're absolutely right. It's just a metric of a numerator with NOPAT and a denominator of the capital base. Per my earlier comments with Kevin, I mean our capital allocation policy is very consistent. That won't change. And so I feel quite good about the denominator which is the long range of that equation. On the numerator, it's just going to be a function of our growth rate. Obviously, the higher we grow, you're going to see accelerations in that number. And if your growth is a little lower, then it may be a little more stagnant. So we feel good to maintain these levels. Time will tell if we increase them. We did increase it here another 10 or 20 bps just given our growth rate. So we'll see. But I am happy at these levels. But to be clear, by no means does ROC drive our investment criteria, right? We look at cash IRR unlevered after tax. That's how we make decisions on incremental investments, whether it's M&A, whether it's projects. And that is more driven a function as getting a premium to our WACC [ph] and risk adjusting accordingly. So this will not affect our growth in any capacity but it is a backward-looking accounting metric and it's important for us because we view returns -- return on capital as a key investor metric for our owners and it's something that we're going to continue to lead the industry on.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Juan Pelaez for any additional closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Adam, thanks. Nice job. Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out. Stay safe.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 And I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Juan Pelaez: Abby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for attending our 2024 first quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section.
 Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of the presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's first quarter financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up the Q&A.  
 Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and a very good morning, everyone. The Linde team delivered another solid quarter despite stagnant economic conditions across most regions. EPS of $3.75 grew 10%. ROC increased to 25.6% and operating margins reached 28.9%. These all represent record levels even though volumes declined 1%.  
 Over the last few quarters, we have seen a row of negative base volumes, which are tracking the stagnant to declining manufacturing environment, especially in EMEA. While volumes continue to track local industrial production, we know there is more we must do to grow. So while pricing remains an important lever for us, we're also focused on other growth opportunities like small on-site, applications technology and investments, including acquisitions, to grow our network density, even as we trim certain areas of the portfolio, like equipment hard goods, which typically suffer in economic downturns. Add to that, the contracted backlog, and we have a solid growth pipeline for the next few years ahead.
 Let me provide you with some additional color on the trends and opportunities by key end markets, which you can find on Slide 3. I'll start with the consumer-related markets, which have proven their resiliency time after time. Health care has been quite stable year-on-year. While we continue to see sleep, respiratory and oxygen demand growing, sales have been partially offset by some rationalization of home care equipment offerings in the Americas and EMEA, which don't meet the investment criteria. 
 Food and beverage grew nicely at 6%. This is mostly driven by food freezing, beverage carbonation and aquaculture. We continue to see opportunities associated with the high quality and more sustainable foods. Even though we don't talk much about our food and beverage business, I'm excited to see good growth opportunities ahead. Electronics is up 1%, with two key trends, which mostly offset each other. On the one hand, we continue to see good growth from project startups, which have delivered fairly steady results mostly in APAC. On the other hand, this growth was offset in part by lower packaged and merchant volumes to fabs as production levels were softer. The current trend suggests that this has largely bottomed out with expectations of recovery growing. From where I stand, I have some optimism that we'll see volumes pick up again in the second half of the year. Some of this will be driven by the growing demand for AI chips and new data centers. This is not baked into our guidance at this time. 
 Turning to industrial end markets. Metals and Mining are flat as pricing increases are offset by volume declines. EMEA steel mills account for the majority of volume reduction due to weaker industrial activity but protected by strong contracts. At the same time, we are seeing project backlog opportunities pick up for new low-carbon electric arc furnaces or EAFs as well as existing steel customers exploring ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Linde has recently signed a long-term agreement with H2 Green Steel to supply industrial gases for the world's first large-scale green steel production plant in Northern Sweden.
 In addition, Tier 1 producers like [ Bao ] in China have expanded their relationship with Linde, by decaptivating their ASUs into our existing supply network for the increasing supply reliability and efficiency. We continue to work closely with our steel customers on a range of projects from supporting expansions to decarbonization. Chemicals and Energy were up 4%, driven mostly by higher on-site volumes in the Americas and APAC. U.S. Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical customers ran better this quarter when compared to the planned outages last year, helped today by healthy spreads and access to low-cost natural gas. Furthermore, we continue to see growing interest around decarbonization projects.  
 The manufacturing end market was up 1%. Most of that is pricing. Manufacturing volumes are down year-on-year. The volume decline is split between EMEA and the U.S. EMEA has experienced broad-based declines in industrial production due to geopolitical and energy challenges. In the U.S., manufacturing sales are about flat when excluding the timing of gases supplied to the aerospace sector. Elsewhere, underlying manufacturing volumes have been stable to slightly up across a variety of key sectors, including battery manufacturing, pulp and paper, and merchant scale clean energy opportunities. A good example is our recent announcement to invest in an electrolyzer to grow our merchant hydrogen network density in Brazil and help customers decarbonize.  
 Looking ahead, our base volumes are expected to track local industrial production, including in there are some encouraging secular growth trends such as batteries, aerospace and clean energy. Also, resilient end markets such as food and beverage and healthcare will continue to grow mid-single digit, driven by demographics and consumer demand. Furthermore, we have a healthy backlog of approximately $5 billion which will continue contributing to earnings for the next couple of years. However, I'm not expecting near-term improvement in industrial production, especially in certain parts of EMEA. These flat economic conditions are embedded in the guidance assumptions at the midpoint, which Matt will discuss in more detail.  
 Overall, I remain confident that we will continue to be nimble and actively manage the balance between volume, price and productivity to grow earnings even in the sluggish economic conditions. And when industrial production levels rebound as they always do, Linde will be very well positioned to leverage this growth.
 I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through the financial results. 
Matthew White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Slide 4 provides consolidated results for the first quarter. Sales of $8.1 billion declined 1% from prior year and 2% sequentially. When excluding the impact of cost pass-through and engineering project timing, Underlying sales increased 1% over last year but remained flat sequentially.  
 Price continues to drive underlying sales growth with a positive contribution of 2% year-over-year. As discussed in prior calls, pricing is localized for most products and thus is highly correlated to local inflation levels. And while we've seen some disinflation, including deflation in China, levels have stabilized as evidenced by the small sequential price increase. Volumes are down 1% versus prior year and the fourth quarter. While we continue to see positive growth from the project backlog, base volumes are down primarily from negative industrial production, as mentioned by Sanjiv.
 In addition, we've pruned some noncore offerings in industrial and home care hard goods based on distribution economics, which is consistent with historical approach. Despite lower volumes, operating profit of $2.3 billion increased 6% from 2023, resulting in a margin of 28.9% or 200 basis points higher. You can see margins by segment when excluding the effects of cost pass-through with EMEA continuing to lead due to a combination of price and cost management. EPS of $3.75 increased 10% as a lower share count and favorable tax rate were partially offset by higher net interest. CapEx is  26% over prior year, driven by project backlog timing. Despite this, we are taking actions to tighten overall CapEx levels and thus have lowered the 2024 full year estimate to $4 billion to $4.5 billion.  
 Slide 5 includes more detail on capital management, including operating cash flow trends. OCF of $2 billion was slightly above last year, but 28% below the fourth quarter. There are 2 important points to highlight regarding this trend. First, Q1 is always our lowest seasonal quarter due to timing of working capital and incentive payments. Second, 2024 had Good Friday as the last weekday of March, resulting in unfavorable collection timing. This appears on the cash statement as more accounts receivable outflow. But we've seen a recovery in April, which should get us back on track by the end of Q2. 
 Despite this timing issue, free cash flow remains healthy as we continue to execute our proven capital allocation policy, including $1 billion of share repurchases in the quarter. We also issued EUR 2.3 billion of long-term debt at attractive rates, enabling us to term out more expensive U.S. dollar commercial paper. These actions continue to reinforce that Linde's strong balance sheet and steady free cash flow are invaluable, especially during times like today.
 I'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. For the second quarter, we're initiating an EPS guidance range of $3.70 to $3.80 or 5% to 7% growth when excluding a 1% assumed FX headwind. Consistent with last quarter, this assumes no economic improvement at the midpoint. For the full year, we're updating our prior guidance to a range of $15.30 to $15.60 or 9% to 11% growth excluding a 1% FX headwind. We slightly adjusted the prior range by narrowing both the top and bottom ends by $0.05. Thus maintaining the midpoint, which still assumes no economic improvement. 
 When looking at the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape, we have not seen any catalyst to warrant a meaningful change in the guidance range at this time. We believe it's appropriate to remain cautious on the remainder of the year until we see tangible evidence of an industrial recovery. Until then, you can rest assured we'll manage the things within our control to continue driving compound shareholder value.  
 I'll now turn the call over to Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. 
Patrick Fischer: First question is just around electronics. A lot of incoming calls on electronics, investors seem to be getting more and more bullish. How much leverage do you have to electronics in that we know what the revenue is, but I believe it carries a higher margin than average? So if electronics picks up, how much leverage could that give to the whole of Linde? And are you seeing signs that the electronics market is picking up for you guys going forward? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Duffy, you're right in suggesting that there is a general view on electronics that we are seeing an improvement. As you know, we -- it's about 10% -- just under 10% of our overall portfolio. About 30% of our backlog today is investment in electronics. All of that is playing out. Our view is towards the back end of this year, we expect that recovery that everyone is talking about, led by AI chips or data centers to actually gather momentum. We haven't baked anything into our guidance, as you're aware, but we do expect to see some momentum build up. We've seen a decent electronics performance in China, and we are seeing equally in the rest of Asia, a reasonable level of bottoming out, which hopefully then points to a recovery in the second half. 
Patrick Fischer: Great. And then maybe just jump to low-carbon hydrogen, blue hydrogen for you guys. You put out a couple of slides over the last 1.5 years or so, sizing that market over the last decade. Just kind of an update, how are those conversations going? What should investors expect as far as announcements again, primarily with sizable projects? And then the one you've announced with OCI, how is that progressing as far as finding partners for the CO2 sequestration and just general progress on that? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So let me start off by just giving you a broader picture of what I see around clean energy projects, and then I'll talk specifically about projects we are developing and then OCI. So overall, I'd say to you, I see momentum on clean energy projects moderating a little bit. We are seeing that there is a lot more effort now in upfront feasibility studies and field studies to ensure that there is greater diligence as projects are being taken to FID. In fact, McKinsey has done a study that shows that of the announcements that get made in this space only 6.8%. So let's say, 7% of projects make it to FID, which I think is a reflection of the high dying down and some high-quality projects then surfacing and moving forward. 
 So the good news is we are seeing exactly that high-quality project that we are working with, and we have a very solid pipeline continue to be developed and they're moving forward, albeit that they are taking a little bit longer. And we're pleased to be working on those projects, and that pipeline is what we have alluded to in the past when we've said that -- in the next few years, we expect to see us continue to go and make investment decisions around $8 billion to $10 billion. The pipeline looks healthy enough at this point in time, and I'm not going to forecast the time with precision, but I'd say to you that the next few years, we will still see that pipeline play out into investment decisions. 
 As far as OCI and the CO2 sequestration partnership is concerned, we have already contracted with ExxonMobil, who are our partner for sequestration. As you know, we have some of the world's best carbon capture technology. So we will deploy that. We will capture and condition the CO2 and hand it over at the OSBL or the outside battery limit to ExxonMobil, who will then take that CO2 to molecule sequester. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Mike Leithead with Barclays. 
Michael Leithead: Just one question for me. On the full year guide and outlook and sort of where Matt ended the prepared remarks. Obviously, a nice start to the year but you decided to narrow the range a bit instead of, I think, historically, you've raised by the better quarter. Can you just further frame out how you're thinking about the outlook? And has anything softened from your original expectations? 
Sanjiv Lamba: So I'm going to let Matt talk a little bit about the guidance itself. Mike, what I might do is just maybe walk you guys around the world because really I think it's important to just share with you what we are seeing around the world, and I think it sets the tone for how we think about the guidance. So I'll start just very quickly and give you a brief on Americas.  
 Let's start with the U.S. market, obviously, the most important one here. As you know, I've said in the past, it's been remarkably resilient. And we've seen many of those end markets at pretty high levels. Now in Q1, we saw base volumes in the U.S., largely flat to slightly negative. Manufacturing declined about mid-single digit. It's a year-on-year. Chemicals and Energy, on the other hand, was up mid-single digit year-on-year, largely because they had planned outages in the last year. So the comps were a little bit easier.  
 U.S. packaged gases, we pay a lot of attention to this. As you know, you heard us talk about package and hardgoods as leading indicators. U.S. packaged gas volumes were down year-on-year, largely due to softer demand from electronics, but also timing of supply to aerospace industry. Hard goods, on the other hand, was down mid-single digit year-on-year, mainly on lower equipment sales. So important to note; however, that both gases and hardgoods sequentially were flat. Latin America was slightly positive in Q1 as well. Looking ahead, Americas largely flat to slightly positive in the second quarter. The good news is the hydrogen demand continues to be extremely strong in the U.S. Gulf Coast. We're really happy to see that pick up in refiners and pet chem, kind of customers are running largely at record levels. So feel good about where that stands.  
 As far as EMEA is concerned, the trend over the last few quarters, largely unchanged. And in Q1, we saw a little bit of a pickup in on-site and package volumes, but merchant continued to lag and was negative year-on-year. We expect industrial customer volumes to flatten as we see developments there. So going forward, comps might look a little bit easier. If they hold volumes to these levels, we'd actually see comps no longer being negative year-on-year for EMEA. However, no catalyst that would suggest a significant change in this trend just yet.  
 I know there's a lot of interest in APAC, so let me just give you China first, and then we'll talk about rest of Asia. Well, as far as China is concerned, in Q1, we were watching very carefully. Chemicals output was up, just under 10%, I'd say, but full year expectations moderated down to probably a range of 4% to 5%. Crude steel negative, not unexpected. We've been talking about this for a while. Well, exports for steel were up, almost 30%, but obviously, most of that, if not all of that was offset by lower pricing. So really, the overall industry didn't really impact -- get a major impact out of that. 
 The good news; however, there is a shakeout in the industry and Tier 1 players who we tend to serve continue to benefit from that shakeout. Manufacturing, largely flat, traditional manufacturing sectors were negative. There were some select sectors within manufacturing that are up. Automotive shipments were up 5%. EV output was up 30%. You've heard the story. You read about it. Battery solar up about 20%. So again, these sectors likely to sustain for the rest of the year, traditional manufacturing sectors expected to remain soft.  
 Electronics, I said earlier, saw some decent growth in Q1. I see outputs were up above 40%, which is pretty good. Semi sales were up about 28%. But we expect, overall, this market will be mid-single -- well, let's say, mid- to high single-digit growth. And our expectation is a push for self-sufficiency and the third round of big fund is probably going to support electronics in China for the moment. As a reminder, China is about 7% of our sales. As we've said before, about 75% of our business is what we call defensive, i.e., it's locked in with Tier 1 on-site customer contracts with fixed fees and of course, resilient end markets supporting that as well. So that's the story of China.  
 Rest of Asia, volumes are up slightly, backlogs contributing to growth over there, particularly around chemicals. As expected, India saw a little bit of slowdown in the quarter due to the ongoing elections, but I expect that we will see that get back in line with our expectations for the rest of the year. You want to talk a little bit about guidance and taking that what we're seeing in the marketplace into the guidance, Matt? 
Matthew White: Sure. So I think, Mike, I'll start with how we approach the guide is really no different than how we've been approaching it for the last 4 to 5 years. And to clarify, when we say no improvement in the economy, it really means from now -- from what we're seeing now. And so when you go back in the last couple of months, I'd say, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's been stagnant to even declining in some regions. So we've updated for that and held that for the remainder of the year. So even though, like Sanjiv just mentioned, the year-over-year comps in the second half get easier, so from the 2023 baseline. So even though that may demonstrate positive numbers just given a softer baseline, that's not how we're thinking about it. We're thinking about it from the current status and how it moves forward more sequentially. So that's how we applied it.  
 And just based on what we were seeing now, we just embedded that in, ran it out and then just saw no catalyst, as we mentioned, to change it at this time. Now obviously, if things improve, then we'll see that benefit. But since we were seeing some erosion from our prior view a couple of months ago, we've taken actions to mitigate that. And that's why we've been able to hold the midpoint, and that's something we'll continue to do, is take actions if things do deteriorate. So time will ultimately tell. Obviously, we will give another update in July when we see how things play out. But we feel in this environment, it's better to be cautious right now than to be overly aggressive, and we'll just have to see time will tell. We've got a lot of elections going on. We've got a lot of geopolitical aspects happening. So time will tell. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Peter Clark with Bernstein. 
Peter Anthony Clark: I don't think it'll be surprised to my question. The EMEA margin comfortably ahead of the Americas now actually. You did get it ahead in Q3 last year, but there were some funnies in the Americas, I think, then with the power surge, et cetera. So just your view on it going forward because I think structurally, the EMEA could be the higher-margin region anyway. And then following on that, on the pricing in the EMEA, sequentially, it was up 2%. Year-on-year, it was up 3%, very strong performance. I'm not sure if you had much in terms of energy surcharges coming off in the bulk gases like some of your peers. But just your view on the pricing situation, particularly in Europe. 
Sanjiv Lamba: I know you've said in the past that EMEA margins should be the highest. So we've finally gotten there as you can see. Now as Matt stated in his prepared remarks, EMEA margins are a combination of a number of factors that we've taken into account price, cost management, managing the spread, right? And I have to say a credit to the team, they do a good job of managing that pricing to inflation, identifying opportunities to manage both fixed and variable costs on an ongoing basis. We do a lot of work, including using AI around our power management, in particular, which is a big number, as you know.
 But there is no one driver. There's no silver bullet that kind of gets us where we've gotten to. And it's a combination of many different factors that come together and all the effort that gets put in. So I see these margins sustainable. I see that now we offer EMEA as the target for the other segments to strive to. And you'll recall this, Peter, that when we obviously first merged, we always -- there was lots of questions around EMEA margins and whether they would ever reach Americas. They've obviously overtaken Americas now and now Americas is chasing EMEA. So I'm pleased to see how the team has really come together to deliver on that result. And I can assure you, there's been a lot of work that's gone in to get us to this point. And obviously, that momentum I expect to see continue.  
 As far as pricing is concerned, they've done a fantastic job around pricing, being consistent in laying that out for you guys. And I see the whole concept of pricing at Linde being different to what you may hear from others. In our view, it's all about product pricing. We don't believe necessarily in just having surcharges over time, surcharges get translated into product pricing. And that's where sustainable pricing actions really have an impact. And for us, that's what I expect to see, and that's what I would expect going forward as well. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. 
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Your volumes year-on-year were down 1%. And I think one of the things that Linde says is that new projects add about 2% growth. So should we think of the volume growth or the base volume growth is really negative 3%? Or is the amount that you expect from new projects smaller? And then secondly, your average gross margin -- your average EBITDA margin is around 37%. When you look at your helium business, is your helium business meaningfully above that margin or below or at that level? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Let me start off by just addressing the base volume piece. So I'd say the new projects added about 1 percentage point on growth and base volumes are down about minus 2%, I'd say to you, which as I've said before, reflect for us our globally weighted industrial production. I've also said before that we are not happy with where that number is, and that growth is also a key priority and focus for us, and we're pushing on many of those growth levers across the world. So I feel that we've got a number of actions in play at the moment, which is there to support base volume as we move forward.
 As far as helium is concerned, as you know, and we've said this a number of times, it is a very small, low single-digit part of our sales piece. So it doesn't really in any way impact us. And I know there's been a lot of noise around helium recently. It's an attractive business for us. And given its size, the overall impact on the EBITDA margin is really not consequential. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. 
David Begleiter: Question on CapEx. Given the lack of volume growth the last few quarters, why are you not increasing CapEx as opposed to now lowering it here? 
Sanjiv Lamba: David, you know how we think about our business, right? For us, as we are seeing the industrial environment around us, we are actually ensuring that we are taking productivity actions across the board, right? And CapEx is no different. So the CapEx reduction is really driven by CapEx optimization, both in our backlog and the base CapEx as well. And the teams around the world have scrubbed their CapEx numbers and they are kind of consistent with the weak industrial activity that we're seeing. 
 Now I said before that we are very open to pushing on a number of growth actions that we are taking. And as a result of that, we find a pickup on small on-site, pickup on CapEx sometimes necessary for applications development, then clearly, I think that will get factored into our base CapEx. As things stand now, just because CapEx sits on the balance sheet doesn't mean we ignore it. We are giving it our full attention, and we are looking at productivity in that CapEx number itself. But we are not constrained. And if we have high-quality projects come through, small or big, we will actually make sure that we are investing in them and then the CapEx spend will actually reflect that. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. 
Steven Haynes: This is Steve Haynes on for Vincent. Just wanted to maybe come back to the Americas performance in the quarter and two of the bigger pieces of your pie there, manufacturing and health care were down. It sounds like maybe you walked away from some volume and also had some -- maybe some onetime issues into aerospace. So I would be interested if you kind of quantify the collective impact of those 2 items and what you're assuming for the balance of the year or just generally how we should be thinking about that. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Yes. So I mean, as I said earlier on, as I was talking about the Americas, we basically -- we did see -- let's start with the hard goods part of the business, which is related to the manufacturing piece. So hard goods were down mid-single digit. And yes, we've been taking a very close look at that equipment portfolio, and we've been rationalizing where we think it's appropriate. So we are seeing a reflection of that in the numbers there. 
 In addition to that, just talking about health care, again, I think health care, I said on sleep, on oxygen, on respiratory, we saw continued demand being there, but it was offset. It was offset by, again, rationalization of some of the DME portfolio that we have, which wasn't really meeting the business criteria that we expect from our portfolio more broadly. So those were concerted and actions that were very intentional about where we want the quality of that business to be. And we have adjusted for both of those, as you would expect. That's reflected in the numbers that you have seen. 
 Manufacturing did more broadly decline mid-single digit, as I said earlier on, within the packaged gas business, there was a timing difference. You referenced aerospace, I want to just explain that. Aerospace, as you know, is lumpy by its very nature. The number of launches that happened, a number of satellites and the amount of propulsion gases needed for the satellites. And we saw that reflected in the quarter. And that -- I fully expect that aerospace volumes will be robust and will be back in the next 3 quarters, just given the amount of launches that have been announced by various customers we have. 
Operator: We will take our next question from John Roberts with Mizuho. 
John Ezekiel Roberts: We're seeing project cost inflation across a lot of our industries, not just gases, but chemicals broadly. Does that drive any shift between sale of gas in sale of plant as you have new project discussions with customers? Or does that not affect that decision? 
Sanjiv Lamba: John, we look at every project on merit, and we will make -- as you know, we've said before, we are unique in the fact that we have that optionality between pursuing sale of gas versus sale of plants. So we look at fundamental economics around the project and then -- and look at the risk profile before we determine which way we go. Really, the project cost movement or capital cost inflation, that's broadly there in the marketplace isn't really a factor that gets considered over there. I think what we consider is the risk return profile. If it meets our investment criteria, we are happy to have that as the sale of gas backlog and you see that we are currently executing just under $5 billion of those. So it feels that we have that optionality as a really strong competitive advantage when we go to market for such projects. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS. 
Joshua Spector: I had a question on two of your kind of recent announcements here. So when you talked about decaptivating some assets from a metals customer in Asia, is that hitting the books now? Or is that something that's to benefit more a quarter or two from now? And then also with your electrolyzer investments in Latin America, just curious if you could frame around the environment down there. I think we're talking more about investments in North America and Europe and particularly around support or subsidy schemes, so how does that differ from those regions versus Latin America and why invest there? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, let's start off with the decaptivation. So you're right, we've decaptivated a plant from one of the large steel customers, as I said earlier on in my prepared remarks, customers see the benefit of bringing those assets into our network, obviously, enhances reliability, enhances efficiency. And clearly, Linde is the preferred option when it comes to operating plants like this. So when we think about decaptivation for us, decaptivation opportunities have to meet the same investment criteria that we would set for our own investments. We are happy to purchase these assets where those conditions are met, where the quality of the asset and the quality of the customer are good. 
 Typically, in a year, we would see, I don't know, maybe a dozen or so decaptivation opportunities, we would probably go ahead on 2 or 3 of those. So the one that you're referencing with Bao is one that we decided to go forward with and feel really good about how that fits well with our network, both providing that optimization, but more importantly, improving our network density in that area as well. So again, I think we are seeing movement around that, and we are happy to be able to be selective around decap projects as they happen. 
 As far as Brazil is concerned, this was a really good opportunity for us, and I was happy that we were able to put a clean energy asset on the ground in Brazil, improve hydrogen network density and actually help decarbonize the customers around there who were actually looking for that. There are a couple of factors that are different, right? You'll remember that Brazil has -- Brazil has high renewable energy mix available in its grid and it's very competitively priced. So renewable energy, obviously, is one of the constraints in the development of what I  called renewable hydrogen or electrolysis hydrogen. And in Brazil, it's really competitive price. So therefore, it actually makes the economics work well. 
 The other piece that works well also is that the comps to natural gas pricing, which is quite high, actually makes the green hydrogen that comes out of electrolysis, it's reasonably competitive and therefore, attractive for customers to want to use that to decarbonize. So those factors came together to really provide a great opportunity for us to increase our network density, put an electrolyzer on the ground, and we're very really happy with that. 
 Just briefly on decap. I know you had asked a question and I probably didn't respond to it in terms of timing. And typically, decap timing starts now. And yes, there -- in some cases where you've got a new plant coming on, there is a little bit of a ramp, but typically, the timing is here and now. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Eric Zhang on for Patrick. Can you elaborate on the productivity initiatives in Americas and EMEA? Have those initiatives changed or have been adjusted to account for any changes in your macro outlook? 
Sanjiv Lamba: We've said this in the past, I'm going to now just reiterate the point that there is no silver bullet around productivity. We run about 13,000 to 14,000 projects a year. A significant portion of those projects happen both in Americas and in EMEA. So there is a track record of taking those productivity projects and driving them hard to make sure that those benefits come through. The EMEA margins are reflecting that, right? There has been a lot of action both around managing total cash fixed cost with a lot of rigor around that and ensuring that productivity actions are happening and projects are being developed. The Americas across the board from U.S., Canada to Latin America have got a great organizational rigor around productivity projects, and we are seeing them ramp up, given the economic conditions.
 I think Matt made the point earlier on, when we see economic conditions as we are at the moment, we are obviously very focused on managing costs and taking mitigation actions to ensure that we're able to hold the guidance where we have at the midpoint, as you know, and we have a track record of being able to successfully do that. I feel pretty good about where those productivity actions today are both in the Americas as well as EMEA. And obviously, we are constantly pushing to make sure we get a bit more done beyond just what the targets are. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. 
John McNulty: So I wanted to address the price versus cost kind of environment in APAC. I think we've seen the pricing moderate a little bit or at least decelerate. But I think, Matt, in your comments, you spoke to a deflationary environment from a cost perspective. So I guess, can you help us to think about that balance and how to think about maybe pricing in the region as we push forward? 
Matthew White: Yes, John, sure. This is Matt. So you're absolutely right. We always think about it in terms of a spread, right, because there's different inflationary environments everywhere in the world. And our model is very, very local. So managing the spread is very important. And when you think about APAC, clearly, China does make up a large portion of that segment. And as I mentioned, in China, you are seeing some deflationary conditions. And this is the primary reason why we talked about taking cost actions out several quarters ago, which we've been undertaking. So the dynamic we're seeing in China, while volumes are flattish, like Sanjiv said, pricing is also flattish, and so costs are actually coming down. And that spread is still positive in that regard.
 I think when you think about places like India or Australia, they're following the model pretty closely. In a place like South Korea, you tend to have a little bit more electronics exposure. So there will be a little bit of an effect there, helium more probably than other locations for us given that, and helium is more of a globalized product. But as Sanjiv mentioned, at a consolidated level, it's low single digit for us. But South Korea will be disproportionately more impacted by that given the larger electronics portfolio. So that's the way I think I'd think about that. And hence, why APAC is a little lower, but also the costs are a little lower. And that's why the margins you notice are still expanding in APAC. And to me, that's really the key is what our margin is doing? Because you can see inflation, you could see hyperinflation, you could see disinflation and you could see deflation. The question is how, as we as management, how are we managing that? And to me, the margin is what really is representative of how that's being managed. And in APAC, right now, it's being managed and the margin is still expanding. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. 
Steve Byrne: I was just curious about your pipeline of targeted acquisitions, potentially increase your density even greater for your merchant and packaged gases businesses. You have more opportunities? And can you comment on geographically where that might exist without regulatory pushback? 
Sanjiv Lamba: See, we are very committed to tuck-in acquisitions anywhere in the world. And to your point, network density is what guides that decision for us to be able to bring a tuck-in acquisition, enhance our network density and actually move that business forward is how we see a good growth opportunity. As you know, in the U.S., we have a track record of doing many of these. The last one that we did, which was which is large enough, I would argue, is nexAir, it's proven to be tremendously successful, looking really good as we integrate that business into Southeast U.S., and that's a very attractive market in which to do that.
 So again, a good example where I think that acquisition has worked really well for us. We look at that across the board. So we are obviously continuing to pursue such opportunities in the U.S. They are tuck-in acquisitions. We recognize that a very large acquisition is not doable for regulatory reasons, et cetera, that you've mentioned. But we're also looking for a similar model elsewhere in the world, and we will explore that in Asia, in Australia, China, in large parts of Eastern Europe, Middle East, and even in Western Europe, where we can get a tuck-in acquisition opportunity. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Avi on for Mike. So just in terms of your project intake, that's obviously down a bit year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. I was just wondering if you're going to attribute that to your focus on only taking on higher quality projects or if there are other factors at play. 
Sanjiv Lamba: I'll just go back and tell you that when we think about our backlog today and then we look at order intake, the backlog we've got is about $8.3 billion. It's currently under execution. We have a healthy order intake pipeline. I think engineering does just under $0.5 billion of order intake a quarter. That looks pretty much on track at the moment. Yes, we do take high-quality projects. There's no question on that. But we have a unique position in the fact that Linde's engineering business is one of the leading engineering entities and gas processing in our space, we are the leader and therefore, well sought after today by customers who would like to continue to build on relationships that we've maintained with them over the past. So I feel good about where we stand with the project intake as things stand. And if you look at the sale of gas backlog, I'll just do the math for you over here because I'll kind of underpin that for you as well in terms of order intake. 
 The sale of gas backlog at the moment is about just under $5 billion. In the course of this year, we'll start up anywhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of projects, so we will reduce that at backlog between $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And my expectation is, over the course of the next many months, we will add back into that backlog to make sure we end the year around that $5 billion mark. So again, that shows that there will be order intake coming in, which will be solved by the engineering team over here in the state of gas backlog as well. So overall, we feel pretty good about where we stand with that. 
Unknown Analyst: Okay. So you're anticipating a higher order intake later on in the year is what I'm hearing versus earlier in the year? 
Sanjiv Lamba: So on the sale of gas backlog, as I said, we are -- we developed projects over a period of time, and we will start up about $1.5 billion to $2 billion of projects that are already being executed, and we expect to add back into the sale of gas backlog and therefore, the order intake for engineering around the same level to try and get very close to the $5 billion mark by the end of the year. Does that clarify? 
Unknown Analyst: Yes, that's helpful. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Laurent Favre with BNP. 
Laurent Favre: I just have one question left. On the H2 green steel side, I noticed it was just the ASU contract. I was wondering if there was any reason why you haven't been involved on the hydrogen supply in the first place? Is it by choice or I guess, by accident? And when we think about further green steel announcements in particular in Europe, should we be assuming that you may have bigger exposure to those means than [ 150 million ] unit? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Right. So on H2 Green Steel, the agreed scope that we wanted to do was the air separation, and we are very happy with having that opportunity to supply them. They are going to be probably one of the larger green steel projects starting up in Europe probably earlier than most others. There are other projects that we are also pursuing. The scope depends on the agreement we have with the customer. And obviously, you know that we are very mindful about how we see electrolysis development. Obviously, renewable energy availability guides a lot of that as does reliability and the capital intensity around those projects. So we tend to -- pick and choose based on that. There are projects that we are currently developing in Europe around steel that include supply of hydrogen and in others, we stick to the industrial gas portion, which is air separation. 
Laurent Favre: And a follow-up for Matt. On the cut-off date for Q1 cash flow and working capital, can you maybe size impact for us? Is it most of the $0.5 billion outflow you had in Q1? 
Matthew White: Yes. I'm sorry, could you repeat that? It was the outflow in Q1 related to what? 
Laurent Favre: Yes. On the cutoff date, on Good Friday, I was just wondering if we should assume that most of the working capital outflow year-on-year is related to that timing and we should see that $0.5 billion come back in the second quarter? 
Matthew White: Yes. So to your exact point, when you look at the face of the cash flow, the AR year-on-year is unfavorable, about $250 million. And the majority of that was associated with some of this timing impact. As you can imagine, Good Friday was a bank holiday in most jurisdictions, even Holy Thursday, arguably in some in Latin America. And so that created a bit of a timing dynamic on the receivables. But when we monitored the first few weeks of April, we've definitely seen a rebound on that timing. And so I would expect to get that back in Q2 as we mentioned, and should get back on track. So really, the AR was the only thing that stuck out and it really was a function of this timing component because, as you know, these are all contractual customers. These are contractual terms, and they obviously need to pay to continue to get supply. 
Operator: And we will take our final question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. 
Laurence Alexander: Could you unpack two comments? So one, with respect to kind of the difference in pricing philosophy, particularly kind of in merchants, are you seeing that translate into share gains relative to competitors? Or just kind of like what's the practical impact of the difference in philosophy? And then the second is with respect to the comment about sort of the number of elections this year. Do you get a sense for your customers that there is a pent-up project list where once there is political clarity, we should see project flow through to your backlog fairly quickly? Or is there more of a kind of -- the disruptions are longer reaching because of people aren't even in planning mode given the kind of uncertainty around what longer-term policy directions will be? Just wondering to see -- exactly where you see the nervousness translating into how projects flow through to your backlog over the next, say, 6 to 8 quarters? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Let's start -- let's start with the project pipeline and it's a reflection on the backlog, Laurence. So I'll distinguish this between traditional projects and clean energy projects. On the traditional projects, we see a lot of project activity continue. I would say that elections aren't having a dramatic impact on timing. I think people are just being very intentional about the projects that they wish to pursue. I have said that in India, we saw a little bit of a slowdown in the business just given the ongoing elections, but that's just around logistics and day-to-day business as opposed to decisions being made from a long-term perspective. 
 So we don't really see any significant impact on the traditional side of our business related to elections or otherwise. I think the natural trend over there is continuing. The pipeline is healthy. We're looking at conversions. I mentioned earlier on in a response that I expect that we will get the backlog back up to very close to $5 billion by the end of the year, which means that between now and then, there's between $1.5 billion to $2 billion of new projects to be won. And that only happens when there is a strong pipeline that you've been developing over a period of time. So feel it's pretty much there. 
 Clean Energy, I also said I see momentum moderating, I see some of the highs going away. Again, less to do with elections. Obviously, some clarity is being sought on clean energy projects, particularly with IRA and 45V and so on and so forth. As you know, there is a very complex incentives and penalty structure in Europe. So people are making sure they try and understand and get a good handle on those before they make large investment decisions. That's the factor that's more at play than elections. As far as your question on pricing was concerned, I'm not sure I fully got it, but here is how I think about pricing. 
 So we've said many times over, the pricing, great proxy for it is globally weighted inflation. We track to that. It's a correlation we built over a couple of decades, a high correlation, and we're seeing that play out. Matt made a number of comments around what happens in disinflation versus deflation environment. And each of those, our philosophy is around making sure that not only are we tracking that globally weighted inflation. But we have actions in place that are constantly looking at converting the price increases that we manage right into our product pricing. And that gives us an advantage in terms of sustaining that price rise and pushing it through into the future. You can see that through the consistent pricing actions and reflecting the performance that we've given you as well. And that holds for goods for merchant, it hold goods for package. And I think that's what kind of plays out in the market where we operate. 
Operator: And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks. 
Juan Pelaez: Abby, thank you, and thank you, everyone else for participating in today's call. I hope you have a productive day. Stay safe. Bye. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. And I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you, Abbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2023 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's fourth quarter financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn over the call to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. By all measures 2023 was another successful year. Thanks to the hard work and dedication from Linde employees around the world. And despite the economic and geopolitical challenges, Linde once again delivered on its commitments with industry-leading results.  As I’ve said before, this doesn’t happen by accident. It’s daily grind across the entire organization underpinned by our disciplined operating rhythm, an important tenet of this rhythm is to maintain a results-driven culture by having consistently focus on performance metrics that drives shareholder value.  Slide 3 provides an overview of build areas I view as critical to running a leading industrial gas company. It starts with people. We have a top notch team who run the safe, reliable and efficient industrial gas company.  During 2023, we made meaningful progress towards our goal of highly engaged diverse workforce and further supported community as we operate in, all while maintaining world-class safety results. I would like to thank our employees around the world for delivering these results.  Supporting the environment is more than just lip service at Linde. We’ve been working on it for decades. Last year we reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions while increasing our active renewable energy purchases by 1 terrawatt hour. It’s a good start towards our long-term goals and I am pleased to see acknowledgement of this progress in or external recognition.  We also positioned the business with high-quality future growth. The OCI project with CapEx of approximately $2 billion will produce 300 million cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen which will be sold under standard industrial gas supply contracts while partnering with Exxon Mobile for CO2 sequestration. And I continue to be confident about winning new backlog projects in the US, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific worth around $8 billion to $10 billion in the next three years.  Recently there have been some updates and indeed some confusion regarding the IRA regulations. We’ve included a slide in the backup to help explain our views. I am happy to respond to any questions on it, but let me reiterate the key message. We expect future US onsite clean hydrogen projects to primarily leverage 45 Q credits since we have not yet identified any large onsite green hydrogen projects that meets our investment criteria.  I expect to see small to mid-size green hydrogen projects, primarily to serve merchant type demand, that these will likely not meet our backlog definition. Aside from clean energy projects we continue to position the base business routes as evidenced by our traditional onsite merchant small onsite investments. Indeed why you’ll see we have one of the new records. Finally, we delivered on the numbers. After all, management’s primary purpose is to be a steward of shareholder capital. We’ve listed a few key accomplishments. But I believe the four most important financial metrics to create shareholder value can be found on the next slide.  It’s easy for management to get distracted by a myriad of financial metrics through which performance can be measured. However, one cannot lose sight of the ultimate objective to increase shareholder value which can best be represented by total shareholder return or TSR. From my perspective, the best way to deliver superior TSR is to have industry-leading results and EPS growth, operating cash flow growth, operating profit margins and return on capital.  ROC and operating margin demonstrate the quality and health of the business. And while both have theoretical limits, sustaining them at leading levels while growing EPS and OCS is the best combination for compound value creations. Each chart shows the five year trend against two members in the industry. Linde has led all of them, in some cases by a wide margin.  We maintained leadership despite volatile economic and geopolitical conditions including unprecedented global events. Linde is an investment for all seasons and I think these charts demonstrates that. But what about the shareholders? How about metrics that impacted TSR, all you can find them on the next slide.  This chart shows the five year TSR for Linde through members of our industry and the S&P 500 index. The first observation is that Linde has far exceeded all three, it almost doubled the shareholder return. But equally important, Linde is one of only 12 companies in the entire S&P 500 to deliver positive outflow for five successive years and the only company in our sector to do so.  During good years and bad, Linde consistently outperformed the benchmarks to reward our owners. The performance culture and the corresponding compensation programs at Linde are designed to optimize these four metrics at all levels of the organization. Year after year, we’ve proven how we positively correlate to superior TSR and positive outcomes, two important ways to gauge shareholder value creation.  Because of this, I remain confident in our ability to continue to creating long-term shareholder value regardless of the economy.  I’ll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our financial results. 
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Slide 6 provides a summary of fourth quarter results. Sales of $8.3 billion grew 5% over prior year and 2% sequentially. Versus prior year, the sales declined 3% from contractual cost pass through due to lower energy prices in EMEA and Americas, which has no effect on profit.  Foreign currency translation was a 2% tailwind from a weaker US dollar. Acquisitions improved 1% from the nexAir natural gas purchase. And Engineering increased 1% from project backlog execution. Excluding these items, underlying sales increased 4% from higher prices, which continue to track with globally weighted inflation.  Year-over-year volumes were flat as contribution from the project backlog was offset by softer base volumes, primarily in EMEA. Versus the third quarter, sales grew 2% from engineering project timing. Underlying sales were sequentially flat as higher prices offset seasonally lower volumes.  Overall, economic conditions have been stagnant as the estimated industrial production growth for our weighted countries was close to 0% for the fourth quarter.  Operating profit of $2.3 billion was 14% above last year and resulted in a 27.4% operating margin. Excluding cost pass-through, operating margins expanded 130 basis points from last year, but declined 80 basis points sequentially driven by EMEA and engineering. The EMEA trend mostly relates to seasonality, but engineering margins are returning to the normal runrate of low to mid teens percent as we begin to lap the impact from sanctioned projects.  However, I still expect global operating margins to expand in the future including 2024. I also like to point a one-time unfavorable impact embedded in this quarter’s results related to the Argentinean peso which devalued over 50%. As a hyper inflationary country, we recorded a charge of $10 million to the Americas operating profit and another $20 million to the interest line or about $0.05 of total EPS.  This impact is not reflected in the sales FX translation summary as it only impacts other operating income and net interest. We fully expect to recover this over time as our pricing aligns with the subsequent local inflation. EPS at $3.59 was 14% above last year as pricing net of cost inflation, backlog contribution and a lower share count more than offset lower base volumes.  The 1% sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonal factors and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. Disciplined capital management is a hallmark of Linde’s stewardship and 2023 was no exception. Return on capital finished over 25% against the backdrop of healthy operating cash flow.  Slide 7 provides further details on full year capital allocation performance. Operating cash flow of $9.3 billion grew 5% over prior year despite the significant working capital outflows related to wind down of engineering projects. Most of this is passed which have enabled a future OCF to EBITDA ratio in the low to mid 80% range.  On the right, you can see uses of cash, which is consistent with our longstanding capital allocation policy of an underlying mandate to maintain a single A rating, while growing the dividend, a priority to invest in projects which meet our criteria, and the opportunity to sweep all remaining capital toward share repurchases.  With that approach, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while investing $4.7 billion back into the business. But investing in the business is much more than just a dollar number. One of the most important responsibilities of management is to ensure capital is invested for an appropriate risk weighted return.  Across Linde, we understand this concept and have integrated it into the culture, so our owners can sleep well that night.  I’ll wrap up with guidance on Slide 8. We are initiating 2024 full year EPS guidance at $15.25 to $15.65 or 8% to 11% growth when excluding an assumed 1% FX headwind. Consistent with prior approach, this assumes no economic improvement at the midpoint. Therefore, if the economy grows there would be upside and if there is a recession, we’ll take actions to maintain this range.  For the first quarter, this translates to a range of $3.58 to $3.68 or a 6% to 9% EPS growth excluding FX. While the economic assumption is similar to the full year, the first quarter is traditionally our lightest due to seasonal factors. Heroes aren’t made in February. So we believe it’s appropriate to remain cautious that’s early in the year.  However, regardless of what 2024 brings, investors can rest assured that we will manage what matters most to create shareholder value.  I’ll now turn the call over to Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning, guys. Question just around China, both on industrial and also electronics and we seem to be getting different cost trends from different companies as they report kind of what the outlook is. Could you share with us what you view as kind of the first path outlook for both industrial production, your end-markets there, and electronics?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Duffy. Let me just start off by a quick reminder that China is about 7% of our total sales and profits just as a baseline and that of course is spread across various customers in every possible end-market that we have. So, you would recall we spoken about China in weakness and slow recovery over there, I think all of last year in fact. And now that this should really come as a surprise. We’ve been seeing China being a little bit softer and we’ve kind of tracked that for at least 6 to 9 months for now.  We’ve also as a result of that taken some actions in the country already as you would expect us to. So all of that’s already in place. Now let’s talk about the outlook for 2024. As far as industrials go, as we’ve said, we’ve seen a lack of momentum. We talked about it last year. We see the same carry through into 2024 for most parts.  I’ll walk you through some end-markets just to give you a sense of what’s going on. Some are little bit stronger than others, but broadly I think we don’t quite see China recovering at a pace at which we would have expected it to. In end-markets let me just kind of mention chemicals to start over. They did have a solid Q4. It is of course weighed down by the fact that construction is a little bit slower. But all in, the market was in a reasonable shape and we expect maybe a mild recovery towards the first half of this year and then maybe a pick up towards second half.  Steel, which is the other major market that we’ve been talking about has been shrinking for a while. In fact crude, steel in Q4 shrank about 4%. Some of that was administrative control because it wanted to hold on their annual capacities if you will. Don’t expect anything to happen on steel. It is really driven around the property market and the property market recovery is not foreseen in 2024. So we expect steel to just muddy along for most part of this year.  Manufacturing generally has been a bit lackluster, but there are some bright spots within that. Automobile for instance have shown some good growth in Q4, up about 17%. EV a large part of that. Batteries up a little bit as well. Solar cells up a little bit as well. Other than this I’d say, again manufacturing has been largely flattish beyond that.  As far as electronics is concerned, electronics saw a little bit of a recovery in Q4. Again remember, the thing to watch out in electronics is less about what is happening on capacities and more about the kind of escalation in geopolitical risk that comes with electronics in China, in particular at this point in time. And again, our view is you will see continued mild recovery probably through the first half of the year and then the second half we’ll have to just watch and see what happens. 
Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you, guys. 
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from – [Audio Disconnect]
Sanjiv Lamba: You should expect us to continue to see pricing actions that we take. We talk about pricing as being management action that something that we do every day and that process and discipline that follows I think is what makes the pricing mechanism so strong and robust for us. You should expect us to see that continue through in 2024 and you should see that reflected in margins which should continue to see some improvement as we go into 2024. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In terms of your outlook for 2024, is global industrial production is roughly flat? And you have new projects coming on stream? Should your base case volume be up 2% or 3%? And then if you can comment on whether Russia is now producing more helium that was before?
Sanjiv Lamba: No, I’ll just quickly comment on Russia very quickly to tell you that we’ve come out of our contracts that are more – that were previously there and therefore really we aren’t in a position to comment on what happens in Russia as far as helium production is concerned. There is lot of speculation around, but Jeff, as you know and I think at this point in time, I’ll probably reserve to comment on that.  As far as outlook is concerned, I might just want to take you back to our guidance. As you know, we’ve said in our guidance that we see at the midpoint of the guidance zero help from the economy and we kind of maintain that.  Your point on backlog contribution, again as a reminder on EPS growth that we see, our backlog contribution ranges from 1% to 2% for 2024. I see that at the top end of that range. You know the other levers well, but I’ll reiterate them just quickly as well as a recap. We see share buybacks and share count obviously help us at the EPS growth level by about two percentage points.  And then the rest is all about management action as far as pricing, productivity and total cost management is concerned, that’s what brings up the rest to take us to a midpoint of 10 plus percent EPS growth for 2024. 
Jeff Zekauskas : Great. Thank you so much. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Tony Jones with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.
Tony Jones: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you sort of highlighted that large green hydrogen projects and not where you are likely to be at least for the foreseeable future. Could you just explain why is it sort of price, you focused on price and long-term take or pay contracts, the criteria is not quite as tight? That will be very helpful. Thank you. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. Tony, so what we’ve said very clearly is our belief is that the electrolyzer technology that ensures that green hydrogen is produced, it requires a couple of things to happen for it to get to a point where we will see large onsite green hydrogen projects. Right, the distinction I am making here is large onsite green hydrogen projects. I’ll talk a bit about the small and midsized in a minute. So two things need to happen on the electrolyzer technology. One is that it needs to improve in terms of its reliability and the ability to operate 24/7 if you are going to have a large green onsite project to serve a large demand pool if needed. The other piece that needs to happen is capital efficiency on electrolyzers needs to improve dramatically to make sure that we are at a point where that becomes cost effective.  Ultimately, economics will drive those investments. And at the moment my view is, the electrolyzer technology particularly PAM isn’t quite at a point where economics work out in favor of a large-scale point of inflection to green hydrogen. My view again, and I’ve said this many times over so at the point of maybe delivering the point now, I’ve said that that’s probably a five to seven year window for electrolyzer technology to scale up, both from a technology and a capital point of view such that we get the reliability and the cost effective basis on which you’ll see large-scale inflection happening.  So, that’s kind of the one reason why we think it doesn’t quite make it, and doesn’t quite mean between. I do expect however we are in the interim, the five to seven years that I referenced, small and medium sized electrolyzer complexes to be built and they will largely serve what we call merchant type demand where you have a bit of flex in terms of how much product is available, how much product is provided and reliability and so on and so forth.  We also see development of liquid hydrogen as an important component, and again we are excited about this. We are scaling up our technology around liquid hydrogen to make sure that it’s there to support the small to medium-scale green hydrogen development that we think what happen in this interim period. 
Tony Jones: Great. That’s really helpful. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
David Begleiter : Good morning and thank you. Thank you for Matt. Your return on capital are very, very strong, mid 20s. And in contrast – flat to less I think five quarters. Is there an option to expect some low return but so value creating opportunities to drive top-line growth going forward?
Sanjiv Lamba: David, I am going to let Matt answer this as this is one of his favorite topics. We have a lot of discussion around this. I just mentioned very briefly as a headline, we always look at our investments on an IRR basis to make sure that we don’t kind of get caught up in the ROC element, but, hey Matt when do you discovered that up?
Matt White : Yeah. Thanks, Sanjiv. And exactly, to start off, IRR is the primary criteria for incremental investment decisions and ROC, as you know is the – basically the accounting metric on the back end. And when you think about where ROC has been and as Sanjiv mentioned in the prepared remarks, we believe that maintaining an industry-leading and healthy ROC and operating margin while growing EPS, while growing OCF is the best combination for shareholder value creation and ultimately, relative TSR outperformance.  So, while they are of course at theoretical limits, 25% we think is a healthy number. Obviously, the pricing has helped the non-capital intensity of our growth has helped. We are embarking on a more capital-intensive growth as we look out on some of the energy transformation and we see that as good growth.  It meets our investment criteria. So therefore, I would see the ROC number, yes, plateauing now as it is, maybe even declining a little bit. But we view that okay as long as we continue to make the right decisions on IRR which we feel very confident about. So for us, it’s more about maintaining healthy levels and maintaining leading levels while growing the organization. But we are not going to let those metrics as either operating margin or ROC inhibit our decisions for good growth projects, they never will. 
David Begleiter : Thank you. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, this is [Indiscernible] for Vincent. So I think your consumer gas backlog was up a little bit over 10% versus last quarter and just kind of comparing versus the slide deck it looks like the manufacturing share of that backlog is the highest it’s been in sometime. So, maybe can you just talk a little bit about how you see the backlog trending over the next few quarters? And how that will kind of be spread out over the various end-markets? Thank you. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Vince. So, consumer gas backlog is today driven by a couple of factors, right? We kind of split that into a traditional onsite which is what you are referencing as an example for manufacturing metals, chemicals, energy, et cetera and then the decarbonization portion of our backlog, which is growing and my expectation is that that will continue to grow as we move forward.  What we are seeing some overlap in that. So there are chemical companies obviously who are looking at decarbonization. We are developing a number of projects alongside with them and we will see that play into the backlog and of course that will kind of boost the chemical side of things. What I’d say, we are winning a – more than our fair share of projects at the moment in countries like India, which are more traditional end of the market.  That’s where you are seeing the manufacturing, metals, chemicals growth and refining growth actually pick up a little bit more. We are obviously seeing the decarbonization projects around both chemicals as I referenced earlier, but also some developments around metals which might follow in due course, as well.  So, that’s kind of what you should expect to see in terms of momentum and that momentum will translate into projects that are currently in the pipeline, getting signed up in the next few years as I’ve mentioned. About $8 billion to $10 billion of that and then translating into the backlogs. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from [Indiscernible] Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. And sorry if my question has already been asked and my line dropped a few times. I am just wondering one quick one on CapEx. What is driving your 2024 CapEx for $4.525 billion? Is it guarantees related to the recent award you announced or that this indicate an acceleration of growth for 2025 and 2026? Thank you. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Matt, do you want to talk to?
Matt White : Sure. So, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the energy transformation we are seeing a little more capital-intensity. So ROCI project for one, which is our largest project that we have won. We are in the early stages about ordering equipment. That will drive the CapEx. We are also on the final projects that will be coming onstream into the back end of this year, into next year. So that’s also driving a higher component. But when you think about our CapEx in general and break it down, we tend to have about $2 billion plus towards what we call our base CapEx, which is a little over a half is for growth projects. But growth projects that do not meet our disciplined backlog definition. And the remainder, in this case would be roughly another two plus billion will be for our project backlogs. So that is contractually committed. It has defined returns and it has contract terms to ensure we get our return like things they have certain FX fees. So therefore, the higher CapEx, we feel quite good about. We feel good about our execution that we are undertaking. And so it’s really just a function of the wins we had causing that increase. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open. 
Josh Spector: Yeah, hi, good morning. I had a question around EMEA. So, margins were down sequentially, but sales were roughly flat and when you talk about the variant, you talk about the lower onsite volumes which I think about lower margin relative to the mix and pricing was up. So I am just curious if you could explain the driver of the margins in the quarter? And then also just your outlook for next year, margins up, flat sequentially, what you are expecting there? Thanks. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Josh, as you know, EMEA hasn’t seen a lot of growth. So one of the things they’ve done tremendously well and I give the team credit, we are having been really one of the profit growth stories over the last three to four years despite having negative volume trends in that same period. So, they’ve actually done a tremendous job of just managing that.  So, let’s go to the fourth quarter which is what your question is and I think basically the point I think that I want to make over there is, there are some one-time costs alongside the volume decline that we’ve seen over that actually impact that volume for the fourth quarter.  My expectation is in terms of outlook, my expectation is in the first quarter we will be back with the three handle on that volume and I think my – the momentum that the EMEA team has built around managing the profit growth, my expectation would be that we’ll continue to see margin improvement in 2024 as well. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. 
Stephen Richardson : Thanks. Good morning. Sanjiv and Matt, just one of you could talk – dig in a little bit on the drivers of TSR that you talked about in the script. Clearly, the business is showing a huge amount of stability and I appreciate that the dividend has been growing at a healthy cliff year-over-year for the last couple of years. Can you just talk about, is you – if you think about the two levers there, is the buyback is it agnostic to the value of the stock? Is it – do you think about that in terms of the buyback amount like us when getting at is your dividend coverage ratio is very healthy and has continued to improve? And so, is there not a place where you could consider kind of rebasing the dividend higher just considering the stability of the business? Thanks. 
Sanjiv Lamba: I’ll just address the buyback piece in the last, Matt to kind of give you our – a more pumping of the response there, Steve. But essentially the share buyback piece we see as being an intrinsic part of our capital allocation. We think it’s an important part of how we deploy and return capital back to our investors and I think it has been and continues to be a very important part of the capital allocation philosophy that we’ve deployed in the business. And therefore reflected in the EPS growth targets that we’ve set for us as well, which is 10 plus percent EPS growth as I said earlier. I feel pretty confident about pushing forward on that 10 plus percent EPS growth despite all the challenges around, et cetera that people talk about, because we know that we have the levers in place to make sure that we get done. Matt, do you want to cover other TSR drivers? 
Matt White : Sure. Yeah, and obviously both the buybacks and dividends are important. We have shareholders that value both. On the dividend, we commit to growing it every year and to your point we have very healthy ratios that enable us to continue to grow that. But one thing I will never promise is the dividend yield. Absolutely not, that makes no sense. If we do our job well every year, we grow the dividend with a healthy cliff. But we also grow the capital base of the stock. Therefore, we will never commit to a dividend yield.  On the buyback side, this is because we have such excess cash in the organization and we see a very attractive opportunity to continue buying our stock back. I can tell you I’ve been asked many times $180, $280, $380 on intrinsic valuation and questions like that. That’s not exactly how we think about it. We look at the long term prospects just like we do any other use of capital. It’s very important to understand that. We treat our capital the same whether it’s for buybacks, projects because it’s one homogeneous pool of capital and we have to find the best use of it for our owners. So when we look at the long term repurchases of stock, that has been a good continued use of excess capital and it also instills discipline in the organization and that if we don’t meet our investment criteria on projects, we have an alternate use of capital. Because the one thing about this industry is if you invest poorly in a project, it can create problems for you for two decades. So for us, it’s an important element of our overall capital allocation process and this is something we are going to continue to do. But dividend growth and buybacks are both important for our capital allocation and will continue to be. 
Stephen Richardson : Thanks so much. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is open. 
Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. I just had a follow-up on EMEA. Clearly, it’s been a strong performer tightened productivity in the phase of weaker onsite volumes. I am sure on your thinking of the region longer term in the phase of potential of deindustrialization. Did you see any risk to holding these margin levels if we see continued deindustrialization and weakness going forward?
Matt White : Patrick, as I mentioned earlier on, EMEA hasn’t quite been the industrial growth story other than maybe a couple of countries, broadly our growth capital is largely been deployed in Americas and APAC, which is where we saw most of the growth come through. Now having said that, EMEA has as I mentioned earlier on been a very strong profit growth story for us, we manage that whole process right through the negative volume trend. 
Sanjiv Lamba: As I look ahead, I see two trends. First, a very resilient base business. Look, there was a view that if volumes in EMEA would crash two years ago when we saw the energy crisis that didn’t happen. We have seen a steady decline. We are – I am looking at the January numbers as we speak and I am seeing that flattened out a little bit. So, my expectation is the resilience of that base business which is also driven by the contract structures that we have with fixed fees and rentals and so on and so forth actually remains a very important part of that portfolio. The other piece which I think is encouraging is, we are seeing large project opportunities led largely by decarbonization. The European Union has very complex rules as you know well. But it hasn’t intent a very steady and stable intent to move forward with decarbonization and push industries in that direction. We see that spurring growing momentum around projects and you should expect that there will be projects that will develop and announced even from a Linde point of view in the next one, two, three years and again, that will kind of underpin the long-term trend that we see holding there. I will end off by just saying that I expect the EMEA market to continue to be an important industrial gas market for us. I don’t think that will ever change. And they will have a strong contribution to mix to the EPS growth that we look at. 
Patrick Cunningham : Okay. Thank you so much. 
Operator: We will take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
John McNulty: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sanjiv, on the – you spoke on the IRA bill and kind of your views on the green hydrogen opportunity. Can you help us to think about the types of customers that you are seeing for the liquid green hydrogen? And also the types of premiums that they are willing to pay?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So, and that’s a good question, John, because the distinction I want to make is I want to just talk about carbon intensity and blue hydrogen to begin with transition to green. So, my view is, large onsite customers recognize the benefits that come from low technical risk, established references in around blue hydrogen development. Blue hydrogen is all about using existing natural gas and converting that into hydrogen, capturing the CO2 and sequestering it to enable a low carbon intensity hydrogen to be developed and we’ve given the example of – that we are doing it already at an existing facility and with OCI project we will do that as we start that project up in a couple of years. So, there is an example of a large onsite customer looking for reliable – with low technology risk option in terms of something that they can then sustain over a 15, 20 year period.  We are – so, that’s kind of the baseline against which I am now going to reference what’s happening with green hydrogen. As far as green hydrogen is concerned, people are increasingly recognizing that the electrolyzer technology is fairly improved, hasn’t thought the same level of reliability, cost effectiveness and I think those factors are deterring long-term off take agreements that will enable green hydrogen to – that off take agreement will enable the modernization of green hydrogen technology to be more effective longer term.  There are small green hydrogen customers and that’s largely built around mobility where you’ll expect small volumes and you are starting to build an infrastructure and you want to have small volumes feed that infrastructure as it transitions into kind of larger broad scale infrastructure. So I think that’s where you will see most of the green hydrogen. There are some small mandates that companies can impose in terms of green hydrogen being utilized in some of the chemical processes, fertilizers, et cetera. But again these are really small scale. And the last point I just want to make is that, I think people talk about gigawatts, as far as hydrogen is concerned the reality is the facility that we are setting up for OCI as an example, the facility that we set up in Sweeny for Philips 66, those are both traditional hydrogen with carbon capture sequestration producing blue hydrogen they are both a gigawatt and plus. Whereas building a gigawatt facility for electrolyzers just hasn’t happened yet. You are building 20, 30, 40 megawatts which is miniscule in terms of the volume requirements that a large typical onsite customer would typically have. So, that scale is what deters the large onsite development. At the moment that scale of 20, 30 megawatts only allows for some of the developments around mobility and smaller end-users. 
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Steven Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open. 
Steven Byrne: Yes, thank you. So in the last two years, your sale of plant and your sale of gas backlog have both roughly increased 50%. Do you expect the latter, the sale of gas to increase at maybe a faster cliff either by your preference and that you do have benefits in the rest of your business from that or from the clean energy opportunities presumably would be more in sale of gas? And then just one more – for that $8 billion to $10 billion that you highlighted as your pipeline for clean energy, how much of that would be associated with existing customers where you could either retrofit or expand the existing facilities which could generate an even higher IRR?
Sanjiv Lamba: Steve, let me going to provide the headlines first and then I will dive a little bit deeper. So the headline is, you should expect our sale of gas backlog to continue to grow and you absolutely right that the $8 billion to $10 billion that I referenced earlier on over the next few years, we will see that translate into projects that go into the backlog. That $8 billion to $10 billion is probably weighted as far as they are concerned. So, clearly, we understand that many of those projects will move forward, some may not and that’s where the opportunity pipeline which is rich with 200 plus projects that I’ve referenced a few times in the past is a good feeder into that $8 billion to $10 billion number that I’ve talked about. So, we should really see that sale of gas backlog reflects those projects moving from an opportunity pipeline into contracts and then being reflected into the backlog number.  Your question on incumbency and new projects as a default, I’d say to you that that mix is a little bit opportunistic and we have made a commitment you might recall sales from our sustainability side, we said that we expect to invest about $3 billion in retrofitting and repurposing our existing asset with carbon capture facilities to ensure we capture as condition CO2 to be able to sequester it and could roll those facilities to blue hydrogen. That’s where most of the retrofit will likely happen and you might recall when we said that $3 billion number, that is in the context about a pipeline we expected over a decade of $30 billion of investments in the US. So, that’s a good ratio I think to just kind of if you were looking for a ratio that’s the ration I would give to you as a pointing in the direction of saying that’s where we think the retrofits will be, that’s where the conversions are likely to happen and the new projects will obviously come alongside that, the decarbonization happening where we are helping our customers decarbonize but also new markets opening up such as blue ammonia et cetera. 
Steven Byrne: Thank you. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
Mike Sison : Hey, cheers. Nice quarter and outlook. I am just curious when you mentioned that at the midpoint looking for a much economic growth in 2024. I get to look at your global end-market trends you have sort of for greens and yellow, so, you are sort of runrating above that midpoint and I mean, are you seeing more growth now than maybe the midpoint in terms of economic growth?
Matt White : Hey, Mike, this is Matt. So a couple things, I think, first referencing that end-markets to your point. As you know, that includes the backlog price and base volume. So, all three of those will influence the growth. As Sanjiv mentioned earlier, the backlog we’d expect 1% to 2% based on the cadence and that we feel very confident on given our contractual terms and conditions. Pricing, I’ll hold off separately, right, that we say is based on globally weighted inflation and so whatever your assumptions are there we should be able to deliver on it. And the remaining being base volumes and that base volume is where we are taking basically an overall type assumption in this guidance, the way we are structuring it. Very similar to how we’ve been approaching the last nearly 4 to 5 years. So we will see how it plays out. but right now that is the sort of underpinnings of what this zero growth assumption means and it’s really around the base volumes as they correlate to an industrial production type metric. 
Mike Sison : Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: And we will take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. It’s [Indiscernible] on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. I am just wondering, you mentioned that China is relatively small part of your business but you didn’t mention opportunities in India. I was wondering if you could just talk with India has more of a growth opportunity than what people usually look at which is obviously China?
Sanjiv Lamba: Well, India is an important market for us. We’ve been in the market for about 90 years. So well positioned. We kind of lead with strong network density all of that provides us in many ways a unique position to be able to kind of win more than our fair share of the opportunity that we see. India will be an important opportunity for our industry and for Linde in particular. But again, the scale at which China is in terms of the deployed assets on the ground, the capacities that have been built up there. It’s a market that obviously will continue to be important, as well. So, we will be looking to winning more than our fair share in India which we’ve been doing in ’23 as well. And we look forward to doing that going forward. But we also continue to kind of track what happened in China and make sure that we are getting our fair share as well. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you very much. 
Operator: We will now take our final question from John Roberts with Mizuho. Your line is open. 
John Roberts: Thank you. Slide 16 shows food and beverage up 9% year-over-year. Almost all processed food companies are showing down volume. But could you parse the volume and price in the food and beverage market? And in CO2 seeing any price impact from the 45Q?
Sanjiv Lamba: The CO2 market really is what drives that food and beverage market, in particular I think the food and beverage as you can imagine has broken up into food freezing and into beverage carbonization. The CO2 pricing obviously helping and supporting that. There has been a lot of innovation done around food freezing. Linde leads the end-market in there. We won more than our fair share and again, some of that benefit comes through in the growth that we see on that line and in the sales line that you see over there for food and beverage. So, I’d say to you that, again strong performance across food. My expectation is it is a secular growth trend we call it a resilient market for a reason. My expectation remains and we will see continued strong growth in that space innovation around application development and use of gases for food freezing in particular I think are continuing to be a very important part of that growth story. But beverage carbonization and CO2 pricing obviously helping as well. I think that we don’t see at the moment any linkage between 45Q and CO2 pricing. Longer term, you could add pieces around that but for now, there is no apparent linkage. 
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks. 
Juan Pelaez: Thanks guys for all your questions. Thank you everyone, for participating in today's call. Have a great rest of day. Stay safe. 
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Linde's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And after the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, Abbie. And thanks for pronouncing my name correctly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2023 third quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's third quarter financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you, Juan, and a very good morning, everyone. Linde employees delivered another solid quarter despite the economic headwinds. Earnings per share grew 17%. Return on capital closed at 25.6%. Operating cash flow was 2.5 billion and operating margins expanded 550 basis points, finishing at 28.3%. And we delivered these results, while continuing to responsibly deploy capital to high-quality growth opportunities and consistent shareholder returns. This is what our owners expect. It's not new, and not a surprise. Time and again through recessions and global economic shocks, Linde has consistently delivered industry leading results through a relentless productivity culture while increasing network density. And I see no reason why that won't continue going forward. In fact, rather than waste time trying to predict what will happen we are constantly striving to perfect a model for all seasons. Here at Linde, we acknowledge the world is a volatile place and as stewards of shareholder capital, we are focused on running an organization which can sustainably deliver on owner expectations. Quality earnings growth, leading return on capital, and strong cash generation are hallmarks of our history and will be integral to our future performance. I think it's important to remind investors of these key tenets at Linde especially during uncertain times, like today. The combination of inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical tension is curtailing risk appetite, and hence overall economic activity. However, I remain confident in Linde's ability to weather any economic downturn based on the strength of our diverse portfolio, and long-term contracts, which is further demonstrated on Slide three. When you read the news or government statistics, I know it's hard to be bullish on the global economy. However, when looking at underlying trends by end market, we see a mixed picture with some increasing, while others are flat or slightly down. Overall, underlying sales were up 3% with base volumes, down low single digit percent, which was more than offset by pricing and contribution from project backlog. In other words, the Linde operating model allows us to quickly adapt to maintain steady and compounding value creation, regardless of the macro environment. The resilient consumer related end markets, which represent about 1/3rd of sales of solid growth in food and healthcare, but a mid-single digit percent decrease in electronics. Now, onsite electronic volumes remained stable, with reductions in merchant and package gases, primarily from rare gas sales in Asia. Based on customer feedback, I believe we will begin seeing signs of recovery in the first half of 2024, due to growing AI demand, and inventory levels stabilizing. Industrial-related markets make up the remaining 2/3rds of sales. And similar to the other sectors, we're seeing mixed trends here. Manufacturing and chemicals and energy are bolt-up primarily led by the United States. We continue to see U.S. packaged gas volumes stable at a high watermark including met fab as well as the recovery in Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline volumes, which have carried into the fourth quarter as well. Conversely, metals end market volumes are down slightly from weaker economic conditions. Overall, higher prices and growth from contractual project backlog more than offset weaker base volumes. This is because our long-term customer contracts, stabilized results through inflation adjustment and fixed payment clauses and differently, we have the right business model and operating rhythm to weather any storm. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, the U.S. economy continues to navigate at higher levels, with pretty much every end market expected to grow year-on-year and remain stable sequentially. China volumes are expected to remain flattish even as manufacturing, chemicals and energy end markets may show a mild recovery, while still an electronic volumes continue to remain flat. Regarding Europe, we have not yet seen an inflection point. So the expectation is that volumes will hold around the third quarter levels x some normal seasonal impact. Despite the softer macro environment and higher interest rates, proposal activity continues to be robust, and our backlog has increased by 300 million to 8.1 billion of which 4.5 billion are sale of gas projects. In addition, our clean energy projects continue to progress well as our customers remain committed to decarbonizing their assets. Finally, our priorities remain intact, be best-in-class in safety, compliance, sustainability and talent development while maintaining a high-performance culture, which remains focused on delivering on our commitments. So although the global economy seems tepid, I can only tell you that Linde will continue to deliver on its commitments. I will now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial results.
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Slide 4 provides a summary of third quarter results. Sales of $8.2 billion decreased 7% from last year and 1% sequentially, although these numbers are not indicative of underlying trends. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billion of energy cost variances to customers, decreased 6% from last year but had no effect on profit. In addition, the Engineering business decreased 4% from prior year and 1% sequentially due to timing of project billings. When excluding these items, along with impacts from FX and net divestitures, underlying sales increased 3% over last year and 1% over the second quarter. Price increased 5% over prior year and 1% sequentially as the business units continue to contractually recover higher levels of inflation. In fact, globally weighted CPI for our countries of operation also increased 5% in the third quarter, further validating this correlation. Volumes were flat sequentially and decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by the Electronics and Metals & Mining end markets. Overall, year-to-date volume trends have tracked closely with globally-weighted industrial production. We regularly monitor tank and cylinder returns to validate this correlation and have not identified any material differences. In other words, the volume decline is driven by existing contractual customers requiring less gas refills since their production decreased proportionately with industrial activity in their local economy. I fully expect volumes to recover in line with each local economy. Operating profit of $2.3 billion increased 15% over prior year and 1% sequentially. Operating margin expanded 550 basis points to 28.3% as price actions, cost productivity, and fixed payment contracts enabled greater leverage from the 3% underlying sales growth. Excluding cost pass-through, operating margins expanded 400 basis points across all business segments, led by EMEA at 600 basis points. Note that America has experienced elevated power cost in the third quarter, which had a negative impact to merchant and packaged margins. However, this will be recovered over the next 1 to 2 quarters. EPS of $3.63 increased 17% as we continue to deliver on the stated goal of double-digit percent EPS growth. CapEx of $950 million increased 24% from last year, primarily due to project CapEx spending in support of the $4.5 billion sale of gas backlog. As a reminder, the Linde definition of project backlog is unique and the most stringent in the industry. Inclusion requires assured growth, a customer contract with fixed fees and explicit termination provisions to ensure investment returns. Furthermore, the $600 million of base CapEx includes $320 million of additional growth investments to increase network density. During uncertain times like today, shareholders want to sleep well at night knowing their investment is safe in management's hands, which is further supported on Slide 5. Proper capital management and quality cash generation have always been at the core of our operating rhythm. We've been following the same capital allocation policy for decades. It starts with generating true operating cash flow because contrary to what some might think, working capital does matter. You can see the stable trends, with the most recent quarter coming in at $2.5 billion. Recall that we had some cash tax timing impact in the first half of the year which we've now lapped. Therefore, I expect the operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio to remain in the low to mid-80% range. While our mandate is to maintain an A credit rating and grow the dividend, the priority for our capital is to invest into the business. This follows our time-tested investment criteria, which has enabled Linde to consistently achieve industry-leading ROC year-after-year. After investing into the business, surplus cash is used for share repurchases. Having a strong balance sheet, stable cash generation and an active stock repurchase program enables value-creating opportunities during turbulent markets. In fact, our best stock repurchases happen when equity markets overreact. This is why we recently announced a new $15 billion stock repurchase program, allowing us to optimize our excess free cash flow and robust balance sheet. We'll continue to take advantage of stock market dislocations and return capital to our owners in a tax-efficient manner. I'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. For the full year, we're raising guidance to a range of $14 to $14.10, representing a 14% to 15% growth rate. Consistent with prior quarters, the upper end assumes no sequential economic improvement. The updated full year guidance implies a fourth quarter range of $3.38 to $3.48. Excluding FX, the midpoint is down 4% sequentially due to engineering project timing and base volumes, including seasonality, although we are taking actions to improve this range. As Sanjiv mentioned, global volatility appears to be the norm these days, so we must run our business in a manner which navigates the uncertainty while executing the strategy and delivering on commitments. And while no one can predict what will happen tomorrow, let alone next year, Linde owners can rest assured knowing their capital will be properly managed for sustained compound growth in any environment. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Sanjiv, maybe to start, you talked about some macro crosscurrents impacting risk appetite. And I think there's probably been a bit of a pullback in the clean energy space, maybe a bit more economic rationality in some green ambitions. So can you speak to beyond what's already in your backlog, if discussions at all are changing on potential new clean energy products or maybe how is bidding activity today versus maybe earlier this year?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Mike. And you're right, there is a bit of a risk off in the market. I have to say that you know our approach to clean energy projects, and at the risk of repeating myself from some previous conversations we've had on these calls, we've always maintained that technology and scale up resulting in projects that have a competitive position are the ones that are going to move forward. And I want to reiterate today that we are seeing many of those projects that we are currently developing on track for exactly those reasons. We work with Tier 1 customers who have a commitment to decarbonizing but are also looking at cost competitive solutions to do that. So in terms of proposal activity, we've gone in the past and had conversations about investment decisions of about $50 billion over a 10-year period. I'll say to you that I feel reasonably confident about those numbers. About 60% of that, I see likely happening in the U.S., again, a very strong market where developments continue to be fairly robust. In terms of more near term, in the past, Mike, I've said decisions of above anywhere between $9 billion to $10 billion over the next few years. I feel pretty good about that number as well. The projects that we are currently working on and tracking all appear to be on that path. And most recently, you would have heard in Dow's earnings call a couple of days ago, Jim outlining the fact that their project in Alberta is moving to FID towards the end of the year. Again, that's just a validation of the outlook that I've given you. One last comment. You heard me be skeptical around developments in green. And I've said in the past a number of times, there are a few factors that impact us. One, investment renewable energy to make sure there is enough renewable energy available for electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen. In this environment, that continues to be a challenge. Obviously, technology and scale up on green is also lacking today. I've said in the past and I maintained that's probably 5 to 7 years away, and I expect those developments to feed out as we see that point of inflection, maybe a decade from now when green energy projects really are available at scale at a cost-competitive level and meaningfully to be deployed in the energy transition.
Operator: We will take our next question from Laurent Favre with BNP. Your line is open.
Laurent Favre: Yes. Good morning, all. I got a question on China. Sanjiv, you talked about flattish volumes. I was wondering if this is a comment about the near term? Or also if that's how you feel about the medium term and are you adjusting resources and productivity at all?
Sanjiv Lamba: Laurent, that's a good question. Why don't I just kind of give you a feel for what I think is happening in China as we see it today, and then we'll talk a little bit about the medium term as well. So in the near term, one of the good things in China, which is on a slow road to recovery I say to you is that we supply Tier 1 customers that are the most competitive in their field and have been quite stable through this downturn. Now, let me give you kind of a little bit more color on some of the end markets that we're seeing over there. I'll start with chemicals to begin with. Sequentially, we saw a bit of softness, but year-on-year chemical production was actually pretty much flat. For Q4, which is more near term, we're expecting potentially a mild recovery as a result of a bit more cautious view on domestic consumption and weak external environment. And I see that play out, I expect into the first half of next year as well. Steel volumes have been sequentially stable, but as you know, and we mentioned this a few times now, have been lower year-on-year. Steel output is not expected to improve in Q4. Obviously, they have their own environmental production curtailments that happen in winter. I expect that to play through and most likely into the first half of next year as well. Both steel and chemicals are impacted by the crisis, I'd call it, in the property sector. And unless that ship kind of turns around, you're unlikely to see a lot of tailwind for chemicals and steel. On Manufacturing, the manufacturing PMI for China has been shrinking. It shrunk a little bit again in September at about 50.6% now. We see volume's sequentially stable. Automotive is probably the 1 bright spark in that space, but I'd say we're seeing positive movements year-on-year largely driven by EV production. EV production is obviously growing in excess of 20% at the moment. There's a bit of momentum around that. I expect that momentum to sustain into Q4 and beyond. On the other hand, Machinery and metal fab output remained weak in the third quarter. I expect those to remain weak in Q4 as well. Lastly, Electronics. Volumes sequentially have been stable but are below last year. As you know, we've said before, on-site electronic volumes are stable. We really see the volatility around merchant and package, potentially around rare gases primarily. Overall, chip output in China did improve in the quarter. In Q3, it was up about 4.1%, and I expect it to kind of remain at that level as we go ahead into the last quarter. So that's kind of a near-term view, Laurent. If I take a view on the midterm, obviously, a lot has to happen over the next 6 to 9 months for that recovery to come back in shape. I expect that to be around mid-2024, but more medium term, if you look at a 2-to-4-year horizon or a 2-to-5-year horizon, I do see moderated growth coming out of China, and we see that reflected in the IP numbers that we'll get.
Laurent Favre: So are you adjusting at all the way you're running the business in terms of management structures and resourcing?
Sanjiv Lamba: Good question. Let me finish off that then. And absolutely, the answer to that is yes. We are treating China as a mature economy, one where we are focused on pricing, productivity, cost management. We've got that team reoriented and have done for more than 12 months now, Laurent. So in some ways, we don't comment on that because for us, it's a given. I believe that our business needs to constantly look at what we do and align itself to market conditions, and that's what we started doing in China 12 to 14 months ago and that is now fully in execution today. We manage that business as I would expect any of the mature business to be handled, to focus on pricing, productivity, cost management every day while we continue to look at good opportunities for growth, and we continue to want to invest there should that high-quality growth come through, which meets our investment criteria.
Operator: We will take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen Richardson: Hi. Good morning. Sanjiv, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about some of the recent project wins that your customers have disclosed, specifically the Australian projects and maybe the Indian oil project? And these projects are particularly interesting relative to what you just mentioned in terms of Tier 1 partners and some of the risks around green hydrogen specifically?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Stephen. So both of those wins recently announced. So our entities in India obviously did a really good job in winning a large hydrogen supply scheme to Indian Oil at Panipat. That's a premier refinery in India. As you know, the Indian market is growing and most of the infrastructure projects as well as large refineries are kind of running hard to keep pace. So good to see that full holistic package. We're providing the atmospheric gases as well as hydrogen to that refinery as they go into their expansion plans. And again, given our strong relationship with IOCL or Indian Oil, we are seeing continued kind of momentum from the technology that we're providing to them and their appreciation of the package of technology and operating capabilities that we bring to bear. We also supply them at [indiscernible] already for a number of years now. As far as South Australia is concerned, it was an interesting project. We work very closely with the government of South Australia. I have to give them some credit for kind of doing some past-breaking work over here. What they're trying to do is to build a hydrogen-fired peaking power plants, essentially moving hydrogen into the power sector. And really, as a result of that, we are now doing a FEED study for them. It is a paid FEED study to provide 250 megawatts of electrolysis and a lot of hydrogen storage to support that peaking plant. Now as you know, a peaking plant really is a bit more discretionary in the hydrogen that's provided. We're doing a FEED study to assess what is required for a successful project to happen. We're working with a reputed power player in developing that project jointly. And once the FEED is completed, we will work together with the partners to ensure that we can take that to a final investment decision.
Operator: We will take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, guys. Two quick questions. First, when you look forward into next year, how additive should new projects be to next year? And then, the second is the $15 billion buyback is very large relative to history, and you already had 2 remaining. So what should we read into that as far as pace of buybacks and maybe cash flow generation? Just anything, why such a large size, I guess?
Sanjiv Lamba: Duffy, I'll let Matt cover those.
Matt White: Sure. So first, as you know, Duffy, we'll give next year guidance next year, when we give that. But I will say that and we've said this in the past, when you kind of look at the backlog, we've always felt and stated that with $3.5 billion to $4 billion backlog should be giving us close to 2% of EPS growth. We're now at $4.5 billion, so we're a little above that, so I see no reason why that would continue. And we always want to focus on EPS growth of the backlog because the revenue impact can vary based on whether it's tolling or pass-through, right, on the energy. Sometimes it will pass through the energy which makes higher revenue, as you know. Sometimes we take it totally, and it will be lower revenue. But the returns are consistent in how we look at it, the terms and conditions are consistent. And so from an EPS perspective, we fully expect the 2% or so on top with that backlog. As far as the buyback, we've also grown. We have to remember that and how I think about the $15 buyback is the pace at what it should be consistent with how our use of the prior programs have been. So as you know, we've been $1 billion-ish per quarter already. We are growing. Our cash flow continues to be quite strong. And so while we did not give any explicit date on this, I would expect that the timing for us to go through this will be consistent with what we've seen in our prior program, for example, the $10 billion that we announced in the beginning of last year. But again, our priority will always be growth and investing in the business. It just has to meet our criteria. So we view that we have ample capital to not only pursue every project that meets our criteria, but obviously a significant amount of excess capital that we can deploy towards this program.
Operator: We will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. When you look at your cost of goods sold line, you went from 50 to 85 to 43.14, you went down 19% and your revenues fell 7. I was hoping you could analyze the decrease in cost of goods sold? Now I know that there's cost to pass through which is there, and I know that your engineering business was much more profitable on a revenue basis. But can you talk about the real underlying cost inflation and why the gross profit increase was whatever it was, $330 million in the quarter?
Matt White: Okay, Jeff, it's Matt. I'll provide some response to that, but I don't think we have enough time to do a full walk on our COGS. But to your exact point, so you have to start with pass-through, okay? So that 6% translates dollar-for-dollar, as you know. And obviously, the cost of goods is a smaller number than sales, but the dollar amount is the same. So that will create a larger percent variance on that. On top of that, to your exact point, Engineering will have some swings based on that and so that will create some of it. You saw the Engineering sales were down 4% due to some project timing. Another factor you have to remember is GIST. So we divested GIST, as you know, and this is the last quarter on [indiscernible] that. But GIST was a high variable cost kind of low-margin business that would also result in a disproportionate amount of COGS. Those all aside, there has been a tremendous amount of effort on our productivity. When energy escalates like it did, while we passed through the energy itself, we pass it through at a very fixed sort of contractual consumption factor ratio. So if we are inefficient, we have to pay for that. But if we are efficient, we're able to pocket that. And so in a lot of cases, we've had the ability to make more investments on efficiency. This also just so much happens our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reductions which we've also been focusing on. And so a combination between the work we've done on distribution, the work we've done on power management, natural gas management has given us an opportunity with this inflation to be more efficient on our variable costs. And so that is another component that is also helping on this. So there is nothing in there that I view as any anomaly or not on a sustainable basis. Obviously, the pass-through will be what the pass-through will be, but that has no impact to profit. But we're going to continue pursuing these variable cost efforts on efficiency, especially in a world where there's more inflation because the payback opportunity is greater.
Operator: And we will take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Sanjiv, can you discuss pricing sequentially? Where are you still getting it? I recognize that on a price mix basis, pricing was flat sequentially in the Americas and APAC. But where are you still getting pricing? And we'll leave it at that. Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, David. So let's just talk about pricing. I'll start off with the Americas because you heard in the introductory remarks that we made that in the Americas, we did see a spike in power costs, which we expect to see recovered over the next couple of quarters. That's a typical lag that we've talked about in the past, and we'll see that come through. So that's just to make sure that that's put aside. Now as you look at pricing across the board, again, very often, we reminded you and our investors broadly of when you think about pricing for us, you should be thinking about its correlation to globally weighted CPI on a long-term basis. And I'm taking the long-term view over here because that is what plays into the sequential movement as well. This quarter, our globally weighted CPI ended up at about 5%, and you can see our pricing year-on-year ended up at about 5% as well. So again, that's kind of a reflection of that long-term trend, and that's what's playing out. And sequentially, we expect to continue to see that movement. Wherever we see increased cost levels, we are more than out there to ensure that that recovery is taking place. In the Americas, as I said, sequentially, you'll see that happen over the next couple of quarters as well. Matt, anything to add?
Matt White: Yes. I would just add, David. Thanks, Sanjiv. We're a bit of a victim of what I'd call rounding and footing in the Americas as well. So when you actually calculate the sequential sales change, it comes to like 2.49%, so it rounded down to 2%. But volume, price and pass-through all rounded to about 1% sequential improvement. But to force it to 2%, one of them had to go down. So we actually are getting a healthy sequential price in Americas. I think it came to like 0.7%. But given the rounding footing to just make the numbers work, we had to push it to zero. So while it says zero, it's really 0.7, and it's a trend that we would expect given what the inflation is, to Sanjiv's point.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Peter Clark with Société Générale. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Sorry, I cannot restrain myself. I have 2. But the first 1 was on the DOE and the announcement of the hydrogen hubs, which you're not involved in. I don't think anyway. I know a lot of it is focused on mobility, but there is some industrial probably in there, and they are targeting quite a slug of U.S. hydrogen production by 2030. I think it's 30%. So just wondering your views on that? I presume there's something about ensuring returns from this. And then, the second question, EMEA margins now ahead of America, over 30%. I think they're up 1,200 basis points from 2018, so really delivering on the old Linde AG platform. Structurally, I think they should be the highest margin region anyway given the mix, but just where you see the momentum from here because obviously, you've seen this enormous jump. I know you're confident of moving it forward, but just your views on that.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Peter. Let's start off with the DOE hubs that were announced. And we are actually involved in them, and we've been awarded as one of the participants of the ARCHES hub, which is in California, where we have a market that we believe on mobility will be meaningful, and therefore, we are participating in that. We did participate in a few others. But remember, for us, Peter, the core of how we think about our business and also the development of that business going forward is all built around network density. And that's the asset test that we apply to the development around the hydrogen hubs as well. The DOE has done a remarkable job and really kind of put this whole proposal forward, but of course, there's still a long way to go to get to that funding and ensuring that you have a reasonably complex structure with multiple stakeholders involved in putting and positioning one of those projects. So we'll be watching out for those developments, but where we thought there was most impact for us in our business in California, we are participating in our part of the hub that's been selected. So just that much in hubs. Let's talk about EMEA, and you're right. I mean, EMEA margins at about 30% is a major milestone. I do recall, Peter in the past, your comments around EMEA being the most profitable region, or at least it should be. We are demonstrating now that it can be. You'll recall, if you go back to 2018, Peter, that the EMEA margins were 19.2% in the baseline. So they've come almost 1,100 basis points up from that, and it's been consistent. It's not been choppy. It's been a consistent and it's a hard process, as you know, and we talk about this all the time, the grind of making sure you do pricing and productivity everyday while we watch out for all growth opportunities that come by. I think that's the model that's been applied. And really, at the heart of this is making sure we're extracting full value from the high net worth density that we enjoy in the EMEA businesses where we are. So I feel pretty good about that. Now looking ahead, I'd expect Linde overall to continue down the path of giving you between 20 to 50 basis points of margin expansion every year as the task we hold ourselves to, and I think EMEA just because it gets to that 30% doesn't mean we 'll be -- waive that. I think they will work -- all the actions necessary to ensure that they actually deliver as part of that 30 to 50 basis points improvement that we look for every year.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Geoff Haire with UBS. Your line is open.
Geoff Haire: Good afternoon. Perhaps, good morning, I should say. Thank you for the presentation. Matt, I had a quick question for you. I think at the end of your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you were taking actions to potentially lift the top end of the EPS guidance range for this year. I was wondering if you'd like to give some details on what those actions are, if I understood it right?
Matt White: Yes. Sure, Geoff. As Sanjiv had mentioned in his remarks, the economic environment is challenging. I think we can all agree on that. And given that, we have to get ahead of it. We have to do things, especially in those geographies, most affected. It was discussed earlier, things like we're doing in China, but we are taking certain actions on the cost to tighten up discretionary spend where we can be very focused on headcount additions. And it's to not only get ahead of a situation, but ideally prevent any further need for more severe actions if we can get early on this. We've done very similar approaches when we were, frankly, heading into 2020. We've done this into 2022. We've done this back when you look in prior years as well when we start to see slowing conditions. So we're taking a significant global efforts across discretionary spend, headcount, actions such as that to essentially tighten down and be prepared for what will happen because while we don't know what will happen, it's better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best, and that's how we need to go about them on this.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Matt, did you mention before the margin impact in the Americas from the power issues?
Matt White: We did not give a specific number. But consistent with what we've had in prior power spike situations, of which you probably know you had in the United States, we tend to take an unfavorable impact to merchant and package margins in the quarter it occurs, and then we recover in the following 1 to 2 quarters. And we fully expect the same situation will happen again here as we saw a pretty severe power spike, especially in the southern part of the United States.
Vincent Andrews: Maybe I could just ask it this way. Would America's margins have been higher than EMEA margins without the power spike?
Matt White: They would have had a free handle.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Sanjiv, would you provide your latest thoughts on the helium market, both fundamentally in terms of operations or lack thereof at your competitor in Russia? As well as the upcoming U.S. helium auction of reserves and related assets, would you expect that to have any material impact on that market moving forward?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Kevin. So helium, as you know, has been a market that's been reasonably volatile. I expect helium market to continue to be tight. You've seen that reflected back in the prices as well. And again, in the near term, Kevin, I do not see anything that's going to fundamentally change that. There's been a lot of speculation around what's happening out of Russia. Just to reconfirm to everyone on the call that we have canceled our contracts in Russia, and we're no longer involved with that project. I expect there are technical challenges that that project will continue to go through. And reliability of any supply chains coming out of Russia will always be suspect particularly given the increasing sanctions, including around movement of product out of Russia in terms of helium as well. That's just kind of what I'm expecting near term. As far as BLM is concerned, my view is I think BLM is a complex divestiture that the government is trying to undertake. There is some litigation around that already, with one of our competitors going out and litigating that. I expect that will be a long, drawn-out process. But you know that over the last many years, people have relied less and less on BLM. It is important in the larger scheme of the helium infrastructure globally, but it plays a much smaller role today than it would have if you go back 5 to 10 years. So people have kind of factored that in. Our supply chains are all developed with a view that we understand the PLM limitations, and we understand how that gets factored in. So I think I just kind of wrap up by saying expect a tight market. I don't think it's kind of going long anytime soon.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is open.
Patrick Cunningham: Hi. Good morning. On the sequential weakness in Electronics, should we expect some additional drag in the fourth quarter? And you also pointed to signs of recovery in the first half. What the pace of recovery do you see given current visibility?
Sanjiv Lamba: So my expectation is that on Electronics, you should think about that, Patrick, in kind of 2 separate pieces. The on-site Electronic volumes, as I mentioned earlier on, remains stable, and I expect that stability to continue sequentially through into this quarter and beyond. The volatility is largely coming around the inventory that is held around electronic special gases, which includes some high-value rare gases, and I think that's where most of that volatility has been. Again, my expectation going into Q4 is, you should expect sequential movements to largely be flat, but the recovery is some way away, potentially middle of next year when you'll see that move. Now DRAM, you're seeing a little bit of a recovery at the moment around pricing. I don't think that's enough to kind of move the needle on that market by itself. Logic has obviously been a lot more stable, but notwithstanding that, my expectation based on feedback that we've had from different customers, mid next year is when that recovery will result in significant or reasonable volume growth.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Both of you have mentioned network density a couple of times in the call, and it leads me to want to ask you about the nexAir acquisition you made earlier in the year. Presumably, that was a competitor of yours in U.S. packaged gases. Has that acquisition enabled you to get even more aggressive on price and margins? Are those stores now more back integrated into your liquid plants? And has this allowed you to change the footprint any -- of where your stores are located?
Sanjiv Lamba: Steve, you mentioned network density. And sometimes we live and breathe it over a year, so we take it for granted, everyone's on the same page, as far as that definition is concerned. So I'm going to spend a minute just talking about how we think about network density and then I'll talk about nexAir in a bit more detail. When you think about network density, it is about a combination of factors. But really, what stands out over there is creating a dense network that has an opportunity to leverage core product, economics and ensure that you fully leverage that to look at your cost to serve, optimizing that and enhancing margins. If you want to visually think about it, the difference of network density the way we think about it is it's a rifle shot. It's a small-targeted area where we have intense density of customers we serve and obviously optimize how we do that. And it's not -- what type of network density isn't is a scattergun approach that you would see all over the place. So that's kind of how we think about network density. Now, let's play that into the nexAir acquisition. So the headline of nexAir acquisition is performing better than our expectations and forecast. So I feel pretty good about having gone in there. We did have a minority holding in nexAir and we were able to buy out the rest of the shareholders to own it fully now and integrate it back into our system. So to your point, we are going through that process of integration. We are supporting them in their aspirations to grow in the South of the U.S. A very attractive market which we're seeing a lot of incoming investments, particularly given the near-shoring or re-shoring sentiment that's there in the U.S. at the moment. So we're seeing three benefits. Obviously, there are some integration benefits that we are fully kind of working our way through. In addition to that, we have the opportunity for creating some revenue upside by cross-selling into that existing nexAir network that exists where obviously, density is playing a big role now and being able to go and serve that market. And thirdly, as new investments happened in that space, we're looking at expanding the network density that exists over there. And to a large extent, wherever we have some complementary opportunities between our stores and theirs, making sure that we're optimizing and ensuring reach and penetration of the market continues to grow. All in, pretty happy with the nexAir acquisition where it's at.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Laurence Alexander, Jefferies. Your line is open.
Kevin Estok: This is Kevin Estok on for Laurence Alexander. So you've touched on hydrogen. I guess, any sense of how many of those hydrogen projects are insensitive to interest rates? And I guess, how many could be viewed as maybe more likely to being delayed if rates continue to move higher from current levels? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: So I said before and I just mentioned it again, most of these large hydrogen projects and again, I'd emphasize that at this point in time, while I want to consider I want to define these projects as low carbon intensity projects. But for easier definition, blue hydrogen projects, I find are the ones that continue to make good progress. And we are finding that despite the high interest rates and some capital cost inflation in the marketplace as well that there is an economic case to pursue those, particularly given the incentives that come out of the IRA. So there is a lot of policy support for these. At this point in time, we're not seeing any of the larger projects that we are currently developing for or with our customers and partners, kind of scale backwards in any shape of form. They're all on track and progressing well. The challenge, I think, for hydrogen development tends to be around the green projects where all of these factors that you mentioned are obviously taking a toll, given that the technology isn't quite at scale and there isn't fundamental competitiveness in the product that comes out of those projects. I said before, my expectation, 5 to 7 years until a point of inflection where you see green hydrogen technical technology solutions and available to renewable energy provide momentum in a lot more larger development on that front.
Operator: And we will now take our final question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning, guys. Just curious, and if you would have told me you have negative volume growth in a given year, it seems like it's tough to grow EPS but you're growing now mid-teens. Can you maybe run through the growth algorithm, make sure I understand how you're doing that? And if the environment stays the same in '24, '25, is this sort of a new range of EPS growth you guys can do given there's not a lot of demand and volumes?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Mike, you know that we've gone out and made a commitment of 10-plus percent EPS growth. We referenced that earlier in our introductory remarks as well, and that's what you should expect us to be doing as we move forward. The growth algorithm is fairly straightforward, and I'll kind of walk you through that very quickly. No rocket science here, as you'd expect. There are 3 key levers that we pull in ensuring that that EPS growth is delivered and why we feel confident making that commitment of 10-plus percent. And obviously, we've beaten that over the track record of the last 4 to 5 years. Let's start up with the backlog. Our expectation is as our backlog grows, and you've seen it grow in terms of the larger projects that we're doing, our backlog has been growing annually. As you see it grow, you will see that contribute between 1% to 3% of our EPS growth. So strong, contracted growth with high-quality customers, developing projects that we feel pretty good about. And as Matt has reminded you in his remarks as well, we have a very stringent definition. We do not put MOUs and LOIs into the backlog. Our backlog is only recognized when we have a signed contract in place with guaranteed cash flows for the future contracted in. So that's our backlog, 1% to 3% in terms of EPS growth coming from there. The next big lever we have is a combination of pricing and productivity. That will give us between 4% to 6%. We flex that combination of pricing and productivity on pricing. I've said earlier in a response to a question that you should expect us to be slightly ahead of weighted global CPI, and again, we've demonstrated that consistently. You know our track record on pricing. But just as a reminder, over the last 20-plus years, we always have positive pricing, and it's a muscle we know well, that we've developed well, we've flexed well. And again, we've been applying that in high inflation environments. Obviously, we've also said previously, inflations, we are in inflation play. We're happy when there is a bit of inflation. It gives us the opportunity to go and have that pricing conversation a little bit quicker and easier. And we've kind of -- you've seen that track record play out over the last many years, so you will expect us to continue down that path. On productivity, deeply ingrained in the DNA of the organization. Every year, we run thousands of projects. We track them, we replicate them. Year-to-date, we have more than 11,000 to 12,000 projects in play already this year. And we ensure that those projects get done, the results get validated, and that's what drives the COGS reduction that Matt referenced in a question earlier on as well. A consistent and relentless action to make sure productivity delivers to the bottom line. So put those 2 together, 4% to 6% of EPS growth will come out of that. There is another lever that we are not relying on at the moment in the current economic climate, which is volume. I do want to remind you that in our guidance for earnings, we've said that even at the top end, we are not expecting any help sequentially. Look, even at 0% volume today, we are even marginally negative at the midpoint of our guidance. We are being able to demonstrate that we have the resilience in the business to be able to deliver these EPS growth numbers that we're talking about. Imagine what happens when volume grows and you have a bit of a tailwind, and we demonstrated that. 2021, go back and look at 30% EPS growth. So when we get that tailwind from volume and the economic activity, it's a really good lever that helps us push that earnings growth beyond a number that you've traditionally seen. But even without that today, we are committing ourselves to that 10-plus percent EPS growth. There is a final lever that really is an outcome of the cash generation across the business. Again, you heard $2.5 billion solid cash this quarter. You heard Matt talk about in the low to mid-80s in terms of conversion to EBITDA. Again, all of that plays into making sure our capital allocation policy is followed. And as part of that, we've said we will invest in every high-quality project we can, but surplus cash gets swept into share buybacks. We've announced a $15 billion program, and that share buyback impact provides around 2% of an uplift to the EPS growth as well. Putting it altogether, you've got that 10-plus percent. I feel pretty good about that. And really, I'd say, in whatever economic environment we are in.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back to Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a safe day. Take care.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. And I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you, Abbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2023 second quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's second quarter financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you, Juan, and a very good morning, everyone. The Linde team once again delivered strong results despite the challenging environment. For the second quarter, we grew EPS, ex-FX by 16%, expanded margins 440 basis points and increased return on capital to 24.9%. These results don't just happen on their own. They require a strong execution culture and operating rhythm, which ensures that all 66,000 employees are aligned towards creating shareholder value. I'm proud of how we've demonstrated this resilience quarter after quarter, regardless of the economy. To this end, we are seeing some economies stag nato [ph] start to soften as evidenced by recent data. Now I'm not going to try and predict what the future is going to do because no one really knows. But I can tell you with some confidence that Linde will continue to manage what we can control and deliver on our commitments, which is reflected in our guidance for the year. For example, we are managing inflation by contractually passing through energy cost variances while securing price increases which are aligned with local market trends. This is a key part of our contractual structure and operating discipline that we've consistently demonstrated for decades. On top of this, we continuously optimize costs through robust productivity initiatives. Ultimately, it's the spread between price and cost, which adds compound value. Add to that, our backlog that fuels growth. We're currently executing our $7.8 billion project backlog on time and on budget. For me, a healthy backlog contains quality customers with secured returns and is constantly turning over. In the last 12 months alone, we started up 22 projects valued at $2.1 billion, while winning 38 new projects valued close to $3 billion. Looking ahead, investors can rest assured we'll win projects that add value commensurate with risk. With this in mind, we continue to make good progress on the $50 billion of clean energy opportunities, of which I expect $9 billion to $10 billion to be decided in the next few years. We're also adhering to the long-standing and proven capital allocation policy, which has consistently demonstrated industry-leading financial performance and shareholder returns. We continue to see ample quality growth opportunities within our traditional industrial gases business. This year, we made the largest acquisition in Linde's history with nexAir, significantly enhancing our packaged gas presence in the fast-growing Southeastern United States. I'm happy to say it's performing well ahead of expectations and further validates our tuck-in acquisition strategy. In addition, we consistently returned capital through stock repurchases and increasing dividends, both to reward orders and also ensure investment discipline. Let me now wrap up with a quick overview of end markets, which you can find on Slide 3. Starting with consumer-related markets. We have positive year-on-year organic growth primarily driven by price increases. Note, sequential trends are subject to seasonality. So you'll see less respiratory health care but more beverage carbonation during warmer months. Health care itself is growing mid-single digit as expected, and food and beverage continues to expand as we see more applications for food freezing and aquaculture. While electronics is up versus prior year, we see some sequential softness from lower packaged and merchant sales into fabs, although the onsite volumes appear to be stable. For the industrial markets, both manufacturing and metals and mining are growing 9%, led by price improvements as well as strength in battery production, commercial space and carbon steel. You can see that chemicals and energy is growing the least at only 1%, and this is primarily driven by customer turnarounds in the United States, as well as lower demand in Europe. I expect the U.S. to improve for the second half since a number of customers already back up, but it's difficult to project how European demand will develop. You will recall that these contracts are underpinned by fixed payments, so our profit impact is mitigated. Overall, the business continues to perform well as we adapt to local market conditions. In fact, since our merger, we've grown EPS an average of 19% per year from 2019 to today. This was achieved against a backdrop of a global pandemic, supply chain constraints, energy crisis, military conflict and the largest inflation increase in decades. It's because of this track record and the daily execution of our dedicated employees, and I continue to have confidence Linde will grow EPS double-digit percent on average, regardless of the economic environment. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers.
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Slide 4 provides an overview of second quarter results. Sales of $8.2 billion are down 3% to last year, but flat sequentially. The comparison has some noise related to movements in FX translation, engineering, project timing, divestitures and cost pass-through. As you know, we contractually pass through energy variances, which can cause fluctuations to revenue, but have no impact to profit dollars. Excluding these items, underlying price and volume are up 6% versus prior year and 3% versus first quarter. Higher prices are the main driver of underlying sales growth with an increase of 7% versus 2022 and 1% sequentially. Consistent with prior years, pricing trends are representative of the weighted inflation rates across our countries of operation. And while we're seeing some disinflation in more developed regions, we're not seeing deflation. If the disinflation persists, I'd expect moderating price increases going forward, especially as we lap prior year comps. From a volume perspective, sequential trends played out as expected with a 2% seasonal improvement, but year-over-year is down 1% despite positive contribution from the project backlog. There are two contributing factors to the base volume decline. About a quarter relates to lower on-site volumes in the U.S. Gulf Coast, where customers took more outages than last year. Most customers are back up and running, so we anticipate sequential volume growth into Q3. The remaining decline primarily relates to EMEA, which had a 4% volume decrease led by on-site customers. Despite the lower year-over-year volumes, operating profit of $2.3 billion increased 15% and resulted in an operating margin of 27.9%, representing an increase of 440 basis points or 350 basis points when excluding cost pass-through. This profit growth was achieved from a combination of higher pricing, fixed payment contracts to mitigate volume decline and a stable cost structure. Every region achieved triple-digit basis point margin increases when excluding cost pass-through effects. EPS of $3.57 rose 15% from prior year or 16% when excluding the effects of currency. As Sanjiv mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to deliver an average EPS growth rate of double-digit percent. Project CapEx is increasing from the larger sale of gas backlog, a trend I expect to continue. However, despite the higher CapEx, return on capital reached another new high at 24.9% as our NOPAT continues to grow at a rate faster than the capital base. Slide 5 provides more color on capital management, including cash trends. Second quarter operating cash flow of $2.2 billion was only up 1% from last year despite the higher earnings. This is due to unfavorable cash tax timing, which increased almost $300 million in the quarter. These outflows will stabilize for the second half, and so I expect the OCF to EBITDA ratio for the balance of the year to be closer to the expected low 80% range. Available operating cash flow, which we define as OCF less base CapEx remained steady at $1.6 billion per quarter and thus provides ample liquidity to pursue our capital allocation policy, which you can see in the pie chart. Through 6 months, we generated $5.4 billion of capital and returned a little more than half to shareholders while investing the balance back into the business. We believe this is a healthy ratio to achieve quality growth while rewarding owners. And to be clear, we are not capital constrained in any way. And thus, we'll pursue all growth investments, which meet our criteria. I'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. We're raising full year guidance to a new range of $13.80 to $14 or 12% to 14% growth over 2022. This represents an increase of $0.35 on the bottom end and $0.15 on the top end. The top end increase is primarily attributed to the better Q2 results, while the second half assumption is consistent with last quarter. Therefore, the $14 figure assumes no economic improvement for the remainder of the year. The bottom end increased more as we tightened the range from greater confidence in the year. By default, the bottom end assumes economic contractions and more negative volumes going forward. Consistent with prior guidance, this does not represent our economic view, but rather is the baseline for the assumption, irrespective of what happens, we'll manage the business accordingly. For the third quarter, we're providing an EPS guidance range of $3.48 to $3.58, up 12% to 15% versus prior year. Consistent with the full year assumption, the top end assumes a flat economy and below that implies more recessionary conditions. Note that FX is a 2% tailwind for the third quarter but has no impact to the full year. To sum it up, regardless of the economic rhetoric or latest opinion on what part of the cycle we're in, Linde employees will continue to do what they do best, efficiently run the world's leading industrial gas and engineering company, while creating long-term compounding shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, guys. Question off of Matt's comment that we may be getting towards the end of what's been a really nice pricing cycle if that pricing increase drops back to kind of historic maybe 20-year trend line numbers, how do you continue to grow double digits in that kind of an environment?
Matt White: Sure, Duffy. This is Matt. I think first, to start with, as I mentioned, and as you well know, our pricing, we always view as a function of inflation, and this will be the globally weighted average inflation. So I think starting with that, I won't tell you what our pricing will be. It's more a function of where you think inflation will be. And when we look at least 10, if not 15-year trend, arguably inflation right now is clearly higher than what it's been before, especially when you think post 2008, we definitely saw significant disinflation and even deflation back in those years. So from that perspective, while we continue to expect the price to inflation, and we are seeing disinflation in developed markets, I still would expect our overall pricing to remain in line with overall inflation, which I expect will continue to be higher than what we've seen at least in the last 10 years. Aside from that, we, as you know, have a lot of other factors, including our backlog startup. We have - we'll see what happens with volume. But right now, if we do see inflation abate in theory, you could probably see some volumes start to come back. And we'll continue to have a lot of strong free cash flow that we'll deploy in everything from stock repurchases to things like acquisitions for a roll-up strategy, like Sanjiv mentioned. So overall, as the economy moves with pricing and inflation, you may have also industrial production trends that could go the other way, and that's what we've seen over the last several decades, and we'll see what happens going forward.
Duffy Fischer: Fair enough. And then maybe on the couple of different numbers, we're about a year into the inflation Reduction Act being passed. And Sanjiv kind of two times you've come out with that $33 billion number last fall, now kind of a more global $50 billion number in kind of over a decade period. If those numbers come to fruition, how would you scope when we get to kind of maximum backlog and what that may look like? And then what would kind of the CapEx shape look like over that decade long period, as those projects roll through the backlog?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So there are two parts to the backlog. I'll quickly cover the clean energy piece, which you are referring to on the IRA and other incentives we see around the world Duffy and then we'll briefly just talk about the traditional end market, which tends to get forgotten a little bit, but where we are also seeing interesting project pipeline and growth as well. But let's start with the clean energy piece. And really, the way I look at that backlog today is just looking at what is feeding into that potential backlog for the future and what are we currently developing that's likely to result in that backlog. The answer to your question, I think, in brief, is over the next 5 to 7 years, we'll continue to see this backlog grow. We'd like to see it grow at a relative pace increasing year-on-year, and I think that's on the basis of the amount of activity we see. I'd say to you, we are still pursuing about 200 projects that I've referenced before. We went out and told you in the U.S., we think the IRA is driving a potential project pipeline for us, where we make decisions on about $30 billion over the next 10 years. And I certainly see that backlog reflect as those decisions get made as we move forward. I'm also happy to say that we are actually seeing most of those projects progressing extremely well in the U.S., in Canada and even outside in the Middle East and Europe as well. These project development cycles kind of tend to take a little bit longer. I explained that in the last earnings call, there's a lead time anywhere between 12 to 24 months between our prefeasibility or feasibility to a feed then to get down to the final investment decision. So the timing tends to be a little bit lumpy, but you'll see that happen as we move forward. I'll also reiterate that I expect over the next few years, decisions around $9 billion to $10 billion, which are more tangible in terms of projects that are currently getting developed. All of that then translates once those decisions happen into the backlog. Duffy, I'll just go on and add a little bit on flavor on the traditional markets as well. Our traditional end markets are seeing a fair amount of strong proposal activity. And this includes all the decarbonization that we just referred to. The opportunity pipeline is spread across many end markets here, starting with electronics, metals, energy, chemicals and includes a few decaptivation opportunities for us as well. As you know, our current sale of gas backlog is about $4.4 billion. That's after we adjusted for the $1.4 billion for the Singapore project. So we took that out as we are starting to ramp up on that already. About 50% of that backlog today is around our traditional end markets, and we see potential for continued growth in there. I expect the backlog probably towards the end of the year to be closer to about a $5 billion number.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Mike Leithead: Hey. Thank you. Good morning, guys. First, I just wanted to ask on EMEA. This business has continued to grow earnings fairly well while European economic and chemical indicators remain quite weak. So can you just talk about what's enabled you to outpace the broader market and how you -- your comfort around the sustainability of the sort of earnings level or growth just in the context of if we assume the European economy remains sort of as it is today.
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Mike. So let's go back a little bit in time. A couple of years ago, the EMEA business went through a reasonably large restructure essentially intended to reset their cost base. At that stage, we obviously couldn't look at the war in Russia or the energy crisis or any of that. But we just felt that it was about time that we've got to reset on that cost base. And that's really what's holding us in good step today. Obviously, a lot of productivity actions, productively deeply embraced across that entire business today is paying out good dividends. And obviously, they've managed very disciplined pricing over this period as well, which was absolutely essential given what happened to energy costs, et cetera. I see EMEA performance, and the team has done a fantastic job. I see EMEA performance holding and continuing to move forward. I see them managing their business in order to make sure that margins continue to hold or hopefully go up slightly as you would expect from our business.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you. And then just briefly, a housekeeping question on electronics. I believe TSMC delayed the start of their Arizona fab by about a year or so. Would that also delay your sales for that site by an equivalent amount? Thanks.
Sanjiv Lamba: My expectation is we will start the TSMC first plant second half of this year, even before the fab actually starts a lot of product is needed to make sure the tools are in place and tested out. So that process has started. All fabs go through a ramp process. I suspect TSMC's announcements were probably related to other negotiations they were having rather than the actual start-up of the fab and how it progresses in terms of its ramp.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. The multinational oil companies have been outsourcing hydrogen production to industrial gas companies because they believed that their returns on capital are higher in drilling for oil and gas. But now that the Inflation Reduction Act has been passed, the returns on capital for them for producing their own hydrogen rise because they get a tax credit. And we're beginning to see over a longer period of time, the multinational oil companies wanting to produce hydrogen. So in your opinion, when you look out over the next 10 years, do you expect to see lower hydrogen demand from your traditional hydrogen customers that will probably back integrate? Or do you think the dynamic is different.
Sanjiv Lamba: So Jeff, I'd say to you that the dynamic from our perspective looks a little bit different. And I'm going to kind of drill down a little bit into the hypothesis you've laid out. So let's look at it from our perspective, a Linde perspective. And I'd say to you, we see the following as it plays out related to hydrogen. Now you went back in time and said, look, in the past data outsourced, and that's absolutely right. And the reason they're outsourced are from the economics was the fact that Linde handles those hydrogen plants extremely well. It's the core of our - it's a bread-and-butter part of our business. We know it well. We manage those processes well, whereas in a large refinery or a chemical complex, those assets sit by themselves and really do not get optimized. So there is a value that gets unlocked by bringing a very competent operator like Linde into the mix. But that's how decaptivation happened in the past, and I suspect it will happen in the future as well. And let's talk about the actual hypothesis that you put forward. And I'd say to you three things happened from a Linde perspective. One, the fuel market, which thus far was managed - and if hydrogen is a part of the portfolio, Linde now has access to a much larger piece of cake. The buy has grown, if you will, and our ability to tap into that because hydrogen now plays a role in that creates a huge advantage. The expectation is hydrogen market will grow to maybe about $150 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. Again, the fuel market itself, if you look at the entire number is anywhere between $6 billion to $7 trillion. So even a small slice of that buy makes it very interesting from a Linde perspective. So we have a new market opening that's now available to us in some ways. The other place I'd say to you is that to leverage hydrogen production for merchant requirements. Let's describe that from an IOC NOC perspective, if that's what you're referring to. I'd say what is necessary is the installed base of assets. It's a network of pipelines and it's the contracted customers hooked on to those pipelines, which obviously create that advantage. The reason I mentioned all of that is because Linde has the ability to scale that up and provide hydrogen to refiners in addition to ensuring that surplus hydrogen has taken and put into that pipeline network, providing a significant advantage and obviously getting us economic returns that would not be available on a stand-alone asset basis. The third point really is around risk debt. And I'd say, again, the benefit that Linde has in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which you saw, Jeff, a couple of weeks ago, the network that we have over there provides a high degree of redundancy using the cavelon [ph], using the multiple assets hooked onto the network, reducing the operational risk with single large either sites or plants. And again, that advantage that Linde carries will be enormously valuable for all customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast, and I think they will -- they value that today. And as we continue to expand that network, they will value that even more as we move forward. All of those provide the competitive advantage we're looking at. However, I'll accept the point that I think as far as IRAs there for a period of about 10 to 12 years, there will be some financial benefits that will accrue from either owning those assets, but in many of those cases, people might own the assets and ask Linde to either incorporate that into our network and/or operate and manage it as well, again, providing greater opportunity for us. You put that together, I think that's essentially what the hydrogen kind of the future is going to look like from a U.S. Gulf Coast perspective, replicated in many other parts of the world.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you for that. Your other line, you had this helpful comment in your slides where you said corporate costs are being offset by the helium business. The other line used to lose $300 million back in 2018 - 2018, 2019. So that we've come to breakeven, does that really mean that, that $300 million delta is mostly positive helium prices over time that continue going forward?
Sanjiv Lamba: I'll let Matt walk you through the math just to say that I'm not happy with where the other line is, and it should be bigger than it is today.
Matt White: Hey, Jeff. So just maybe to start with what is in Other, right? That's probably a good place to start. So currently, what's in Other is our Materials Technology business, formerly called PST. You may recall the coatings business. It has what we call wholesale or our inter co-helium business. So this is where we source globally since it is one of the very, very few global products that we make and sell. We source it and then we sell it into a company to all of the regions. Therefore, it's more of an intercompany type pricing structure that we have with that. And then obviously, the end regions buy it an intercompany, we eliminate it and they get the un-priced in their regions for helium. And then it has all of our global corporate costs to manage Linde plc as a whole. As you well know, we divested GIST. That used to be in there, that is gone. So that's what's in there today. And one thing we've always said for many years is to your exact point, and I would kind of take 2018 with a grain of salt. That was a transition year. That was, as you know, a pro forma number. There were some elements that didn't fit particularly into the segments that needed to go in that section as we did pro forma at the time of merger. So I would use 2019 as the better starting point because that is post the merger when we had, I'd say, more consistency across what was in there. And when you think about it, we've always said our goal is to make sure that these businesses and other, which are not core industrial gas businesses can more than offset the corporate cost of this global organization. And we're seeing that, and we expect to continue to see that. And it's a combination of the noncore businesses improving their performance, which they're absolutely doing. And it's also a combination of managing our corporate costs appropriately in light of what's going on in the world and what's going on in the segments we support. So that's how to think about that, but we're going to continue to look to create value in the other segment like we do anywhere else in any other segment going forward.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nicola Tang with BNP. Your line is open
Nicola Tang: Hi, everyone. Just one for me on margins. I understand you kind of see further margin upside into next year at a group level, but I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how that would play out from a regional perspective. So I'm thinking if there's pricing normalization in Europe, is there a situation where European margins trend down from here, but then actually another region takes over to drive group margins?
Sanjiv Lamba: Nicola, we've asked questions on margins consistently. As you'll recall, and I've always said, look, your expectation and our expectation is we will expand margins year-on-year by about 30 to 50 basis points. And that's kind of the trend that we want to see happen. And obviously, this quarter delivered significantly higher than that across all segments, and that is good. And as you know, it's driven by pricing and productivity and the base business continued to deliver kind of great outcomes. A couple of highlights on that, I'd say, at the regional level, America is hitting a 30-plus percent margin. That's a good point. We've got to make sure that EMEA and APAC are looking ahead to beating America. So they kind of have to set the target for the rest. EMEA margins, you're right, also a highlight for us in the quarter at 29.2%. They've now grown over since 2018 baseline, they've grown about 1,000 basis points, and they've grown consistently. So the point that I made earlier on around the fact that we reset our cost base in EMEA, the fact that we were pushing productivity and pricing gives me a lot of confidence that we will try and hold that margin level and continue to try and look for that margin improvement that I suggested on a year-on-year basis. As far as APAC is concerned, we've also seen good margin kind of development since that baseline of 2018 to where we are today. At 28%, they're up about 1,070 basis points. And again, that's been fairly consistent over that period. So I fully expect that we will continue to work on our margin to work with that intent of delivering 30 to 50 basis points every year.
Nicola Tang: All right. Thank you. Its impressive.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you, good morning, Sanjiv, productivity has been a key driver of earnings growth this year. Can you remind us what that number quantified that number this year? And should it be similar next year as well?
Sanjiv Lamba: So I'll tell you that productivity is something that sits right at the heart of how we manage our base business, David, as you know well. And essentially, I mentioned in one of the earnings calls previously that we had about 14,000 projects last year in 2022. For the first half of this year, we have an excess of 8,000 projects. So I feel pretty good about the fact that there is a continuous pipeline of productivity projects that continue to work through and actually deliver. There is no silver bullet. There isn't a single big thing that we do is the aggregation of these 8,000-plus projects that actually deliver results for us as we move forward. The way we think about the number on productivity is to look at its impact on the cost base that it actually kind of leverages off. So we measure that as a percentage to that cost stack and as things stand, we kind of look at a range of between 5% to 7% of cost tax, and that's what then flows into the bottom line that we work through.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on the clean energy opportunity, is there a market share you're thinking about that Linde should attain over a longer period of time?
Sanjiv Lamba: To be honest, we don't think about the clean energy opportunity or the portfolio in terms of market share. We think in terms of selecting high-quality projects that meet our investment criteria and that give us - that allow us to leverage the asset base and the network that we have giving us competitive advantage. And really, to be honest, when we went down and gave you some numbers around that $30 billion in terms of decisions we're likely to make over the decade in the U.S. of $50 billion across the world is driven really around the opportunity set. And that's how I'd like to think about that. The market share will be what it will be. Really thinking about focusing on choosing the right opportunities and ensuring that we develop them well, go through a proper feed and FID process and actually execute well. These are advantages that our engineering team brings for us. We do all of that. We then have a substantive business as we move forward.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Tony Jones with Redburn. Your line is open. And Mr. Jones your line is open, please shut your mute button. And hearing no response, we will move to our next question from Peter Clark with Société Générale. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Yes. Thank you. Hopefully, you can hear me. I've got two questions. The first one, I've listened to the discussion on the pricing, the inflation thing, but it feels like you've still got momentum at least into the third quarter. So I'm just wondering about sequential price into the third quarter than we'll see from Q4. So I'm assuming you've got something. And then on the EMEA [ph] margin discussion, I'm rightly thinking obviously on-site was hit harder. So that presumably helped the margin a little bit on mix. Just wondering how you see the second half in EMEA on both in cylinders and on on-site because one of your competitors is a bit more confident about the second half year-on-year comp in the on-site given the very soft comp. And obviously, energy costs are a lot lower in Europe now a bit more confidence with the customer. So how you see those things? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Peter, I'll go back and refer to the comment that Matt provided on pricing earlier on to say that we believe you've got an established long-term history of positive pricing coming out of Linde. We think globally weighted inflation is a great proxy for Linde's pricing. In Q2 you saw us deliver 7% globally weighted inflation for us was between 5% and 6%. So we're slightly ahead of that. That momentum that he talk about, I think, is really built around the inflation, and we've said that we are a good player on inflation, and we'll continue to progress with that. I'll also just mention that pricing is really all about management action. I mean rather than relying on a set of indices, we proactively work on pricing to make sure that product pricing continues to grow and is expanded. And that's really what - where pricing impact comes through. We don't rely on surcharges for sustainable pricing longer term. As far as EMEA margin is concerned, without getting into the detail of how we see the margin split between the impact from different businesses, what I'd say to you is you've seen some very, I would say, in some spectacular margins coming out of EMEA. It's really been driven around mix of pricing and productivity running deep in that organization. And I fully expect that, that quality of business that we've now enhanced in EMEA will continue as we move forward. And I think the mix will not really be that impactful for us, really, overall, our portfolio will deliver the margin that we're looking for. I'll also make another point just to kind of remind folks that as I think about margin, and you've heard me say this before, we constantly benchmark as an organization. We might even be obsessed by benchmarking. And one of the things that I lay out for the business very often is just reminding them that -- and I'm using 2022 numbers because that's kind of just the baseline we were using. But when I take 2022 margin numbers, in the Americas, more than 10 countries had margins in excess of 30%. In Europe or EMEA that we just talked about, 17 countries had margin more than 30% and APAC about 7 countries at margins more than 30%. The reason I mentioned that to you is because our internal benchmark drives a lot of the behavior within these segments, driving ourselves to make sure that we are improving the overall aggregate by getting to margins that get to that 30% kind of target that we've got internally and which Americas are set for the rest of the segments as well.
Peter Clark: Thank you. Do you think the on site will be a bit better in the second half yourself in EMEA?
Sanjiv Lamba: It's very difficult to predict what on-site will do. I said this in my opening comments as well. It's very difficult to predict what on-site will do in Europe at the moment, particularly chemicals and energy. I do see an uptick on metals. So I do believe that metals will continue to show that momentum, but it is difficult to predict what chemicals and energy will do. And it's going to be driven by a multiple of factors, including energy prices, but also what happens in terms of the winter and the weather.
Peter Clark: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael Sison: Good morning, guys. Historically, volume sort of drove some of -- a good portion of our adjusted EBIT growth and your volumes are down 1%, yes, you're still able to generate pretty impressive operating profit growth and EPS growth. So if volumes aren't positive, whenever they do, does your leverage get better from here? Or do you have to add cost to sort of support some of that volume growth?
Sanjiv Lamba: The way to think about this is really if you look at how we think about our EPS growth algorithm, right? And we've said this before, there are two or three components that drive that. Our base business drives a large part of that, right? We expect our base business to deliver anywhere between 4% to 6% of that EPS growth that we talk about, the target that we've set for ourselves of 10-plus percent EPS growth. Backlog, given that backlog continues to grow at the moment, probably or in the past, you would expect backlog to provide between 1% to 2% of EPS growth. We now see that with backlog growth going forward, that's going to range probably between 1% to 3% probably at the top end, given the higher CapEx backlog that you will see. And then we'll have a little bit of an uplift from share buybacks, which will remain largely consistent about 2%. You add it all up, that kind of gets you to the algorithm of 10-plus percent. The base business delivering about 4% to 6%. There's a mix in the base business. You'll see pricing, you'll see productivity and you see some volume. But volumes are down, pricing and productivity have to do more. When volumes pick up, obviously, we see a little bit of cost come in, but we manage productivity very, very hard through that period as well. So it's that mix of base business, 4% to 6% kind of contribution to the EPS growth that you should be thinking about.
Michael Sison: Understood. And then for the second half, are your volumes -- I apologize if I missed this. Are they going to stay similar to the second quarter? Are they going to improve a little bit on a year-over-year basis? I know sequential, I think you mentioned it was going to be better. And then how much volume growth will you get from new projects in '24?
Sanjiv Lamba: So as we said before, we are starting up projects all in for this year, about $2 billion. A large portion of that was the Singapore piece. That's already happened. That is ramping up through the course of this year, and the balance will happen in the second half. So you'll see some backlog contributions through the course of the second half. Broadly on volumes, I'd say to you, I expect -- why don't I just do a quick walk around the wall and give you a sense of what I'm seeing across in terms of expectations. So if you look at Americas, we were kind of largely flat for the quarter in Q2, adjusted for customer outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast and some softer electronics sales mainly on rare gases. The U.S. Gulf Coast customers have largely come back and they're ramping up production. So I expect positive volume sequentially as a result of that. Much of sales, I'd say to you probably expect that to be flattish. Remember, it's important, I think sometimes we forget, but the Americas business overall has shown steady recovery since COVID. We are at levels well above pre-COVID. So we are at somewhat of a high watermark, and I'm seeing that flatten out a little bit, and we feel pretty good about where that is. As far as the U.S. package business is concerned, I'd say we are -- in Q2, we saw mid-single-digit growth. Manufacturing saw some upside and then that is offset by electronic sales being a little bit softer on the rare gases side. Hard goods in Q2 were a bit of a mixed bag. We saw consumables, wire, et cetera, grow. We saw equipment sales come down a little bit. Expectations, I'd say, for the U.S. package business would be flattish as we go into Q3. So all in, I'd say some upside from the HyCO business, U.S. Gulf Coast, but beyond that, probably flat volumes. As far as APAC is concerned, really, I think it's a story of China and the rest of Asia. The rest of Asia, India, particularly, I see growth continuing. I see that momentum in the second half as well. ASEAN, a little bit softer will still grow, but will be probably softer growth than we've seen. And then there's a story of China. I mean, as you know, without getting to a lot of detail on China, I'd say to you, the highlights are, year-on-year volumes were flat sequentially, up 4%, largely because there was a lunar year in Q1, based on what I'm seeing, I expect Q3 volumes to be flattish, to [ph] chemicals, electronics demand continues to be soft. The government has earlier this week, in fact, on 24 announced a large intent of stimulation of the economy and consumption. But really for an economy that size for us to see any visible impact of that probably towards the end of the year. And then we are left with EMEA. And EMEA volumes, I expect, will be consistent. I can't see anything that suggests that we'll see a significant improvement in the second half. I believe in Q3, as an example, adjusted for seasonal variations, et cetera, you will see flattish volumes.
Michael Sison: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Matt, I might be overthinking this a little bit, but could you just maybe help me better understand historically, your guidance midpoint had assumed no economic growth and now the high end assumes no economic growth. So what caused you to sort of change that framework?
Matt White: Yes, Vince. We have - if you go back far enough, we have bounced a little bit around on that, sometimes high end, sometimes middle end. It just gets to a function of when we put the numbers together and we sort of how many quarters we have left and what we see going on and also the sequential trends will play into that as well. So -- so right now, I'd say, yes, the high end, I wouldn't look much further beyond that's just how the numbers are put together. That's how the guidance range resulted. And as you well know, we're going to continue to do what we do to try and improve on that. But right now, this is the guidance we have out there. And to your exact point, those are the base assumptions underlying it.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Fair enough. If I could just ask on the pricing equation. Is there a way we can think about the price you achieved in the second quarter and maybe what you're expecting to achieve in the third quarter? How much of that is lapping of prior price initiatives versus how much of that is sort of the implementation of new initiatives? Is there a way you can help us think through that?
Matt White: Sure, Vince. This is Matt. There's always around the world, and you have to remember, all of our pricing is incredibly local, right? It's in the almost 100 countries around the world. They're individual initiatives. They are all done based on individual contracts. And so at any point in time, there are always price adjustments, actions, contractual inflation adjustments occurring everywhere in the world at all times. And so given that, it's always going to have a component that carries into the next 4 quarters or 3 quarters, and that's what you're going to see. So clearly, to your point, on a lapping basis, when you lap high global inflation periods and you do see disinflation, then yes, the comps get a little tougher. That's natural. That's normal, especially as what we're seeing in the developed -- some of the developed nations, but other than that, there are continuous price items going on simply because of the contract structures. So I would say we absolutely expect to carry into next year. We are still seeing actions today. And remember, there are many countries that still have double-digit inflation going on right now. And so you have to consider that as well because, again, it's a very local approach.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Very helpful. As usual, I really appreciate it.
Operator: We will take our next question from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is open.
Patrick Cunningham: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thank you,. Thanks for taking my question. In June, you announced the contracts with Wanhua for decaptivating ASUs in terms of future opportunities to decaptivate ASUs in Asia, can you size the potential there for Linde, both in terms of backlog and the addressable market? And would future investments need to include additional investment in decarbonization or are you agnostic from that standpoint?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Patrick, let me -- I didn't quite get your second question, but let me answer the first as well on decap and then maybe you can repeat that second question. Let's start with Wanhua. So what we announced was a decap of ASUs. Now over the last 30 years, we've probably done most of the large ASU decaps with customers that we feel comfortable running a long-term gas supply contract with. So I don't think I'd say to you that there is a large market that we are expecting to see work out on the decap side. Remember, we don't necessarily want to use decap as a way of providing financing to our customers. It's where there is a deeper integration into greater density for us in a particular market and a high-quality customer. When that mix comes together, that's where decap makes sense for us. So we have selective opportunities that we are pursuing. We have a pipeline around that. But I wouldn't say to you that you should expect significant levels of opportunity going into the backlog as a consequence. Remind me of your second question again.
Patrick Cunningham: Yes. Yes, got it. And that's just on the second part of my question, I know the Wanhua agreement included investments in decarbonization. And I know you mentioned that network density is – hard there, but would you look for additional investment in decarbonization if there are future opportunities? Thanks, again.
Sanjiv Lamba: Yes. Where we are either incumbent with customers. On decarbonization, I'd say, Patrick, that we have the technology portfolio and the operating skill set and where we incumbent with customers on the industrial side, we think that's right in our wheelhouse. We have great carbon capture technology that we can utilize. We can either find a chemical sync or a sequestration partner to work with, and that combination is really helpful. So we continue to do that. I think there are some easier decarbonization cases in China as an example, where it's about making sure that we're moving from steam turbine-driven equipment to actually moving to just going on to the grid and using renewable power. That's a scope to emission reduction as well as better economic case in most cases. So I really want turns out to be a nice win-win as we look and execute those projects.
Patrick Cunningham: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. On slide 13, you provide some helpful pie charts that speak to your backlog composition and so just wonder if you could speak to how you would expect those pies to evolve over the next year or two. For example, EMEA has been quite small, historically, recent history anyway for understandable reasons. But would you expect that to grow materially as clean energy projects gain traction? And curious within Asia Pacific, what is the mix of clean energy versus more traditional projects that you're seeing there in your discussions and how you would expect that to evolve as well?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Kevin. So let me address two points. One, my expectation on that backlog, the pie itself is that it will continue to grow just to make sure that, that's kind of understood. Let's talk about the mix a little bit then. As you know, on the decarbonization piece, we went out and gave you guys some numbers saying we expect over a decade that about $30 billion in the U.S. and about $50 billion globally. So that is a ratio that I expect. I expect the U.S. or Americas to be around 60% of that decarbonization pie, and I expect the balance to be between EMEA and APAC. I do expect larger projects in EMEA. We're working on a number of them in Middle East and Europe that I feel pretty good about that are progressing well. And I think that as part of that, the balance 40% as it were, I do expect EMEA will have more than its fair share of that. I'll also add and tell you that the Asia Pac decarbonization effort is much smaller and slower. They are behind the Americas and EMEA by a number of years at this point. And I do not see the scale that I see in Americas and to some extent, EMEA on those projects as yet. And I suspect they are probably 3 to 5 years away in terms of getting projects of that scale.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Laurence Alexander: Just a housekeeping question on packaged gases. How is pricing for rental fees evolving in Europe and in the U.S. compared to inflation? Is it just sort of moving at a low single-digit rate regardless of the background inflation environment? Or have you been moving it up ahead of inflation?
Sanjiv Lamba: So both Europe and the U.S. package businesses are reasonably large, Laurence [ph] as you know. And we've been very consistent in our rental pricing actions that have happened over the last few years. So I think we ensure that there is more than recovery of inflation, and we continue to have a very consistent policy around that.
Laurence Alexander: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open,
Steve Byrne: Yes. Just continuing on that packaged gases question. Post the nexAir acquisition, what would you estimate your share of U.S. packaged gases business? And how would you compare your pricing power in that business now versus liquid bulk? And any indications on trends for hard goods and so forth that would give you an outlook for the U.S. economy?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Steve. So let me address both those points separately. Let's talk about the packaged gases. The nexAir acquisition has been extremely good for us. We've got a strong footprint in Southeast U.S., which is seeing a lot of growth and a lot of incoming investments as well. So I feel pretty good about where we stand. My comment on the market share would be that it isn't high enough. That's why I tell my guys, and I'm going to tell you the same thing. We don't particularly disclose market share numbers specifically. But given the strength of the footprint that we have, we have strong pricing power. We've demonstrated that over the last many years, and that business is actually demonstrating pricing power reflecting into margin improvement consistently over the last many years. So I feel pretty good about where we stand over there. Let's talk a little bit about hard goods. So hare good is you're right in pointing out, is a good leading indicator. The last time we spoke, I mentioned that I was seeing a little bit, and this was in the last earnings call I mentioned that I was seeing a little bit of softening on growth. I can say to you today, we are seeing a bit of a mixed bag. Why is in consumables are seeing some slightly positive growth as far as sales are concerned, whereas on equipment sales, we are seeing some declines. And that is something that you could look at in terms of the amount of manufacturing activity and order books that you have. But remember, this is also a season where many of the manufacturers do take breaks. So sometimes prior to that, we would see a little bit of softening in the market. So I'm not going to pass the judgment just yet. I'll hold and see what happens beyond September.
Steve Byrne: Thank you. And a question on clean energy. Can you just roughly estimate the sizes of these buckets for you with respect to the opportunity for you? Obviously, you got a blue energy - blue hydrogen production and sales. You got green hydrogen. But you also have oxyfuel opportunities for big energy consumers. You have a mean based decarbonization projects. How would you size those relative to each other?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Steve, the best way to describe that opportunity for us is to think about the three buckets that we traditionally talk about. Let me walk you through them first, and I can tell you where carbon capture, as an example, plays a role or not. So the three buckets that we normally track or mobility. We track industrial applications, and we track energy carrier, energy vector. As far as mobility is concerned, typically, it's about 10% or less of our entire opportunity pipeline. Multiple projects, smaller in size, tends to be more on the green side with hydrogen refilling stations package typically alongside that. 60% of that opportunity set that we see today is all around industrial applications. This is large blue projects, a few green as well, but dominated by blue that sits right in the middle of -- right in the heart of our -- in the wheelhouse and the heart of our incumbent position that we have with many industrial customers where we're helping them decarbonize their operations by providing hydrogen and/or in some cases, by providing carbon capture and utilization or sequestration opportunities. That's 60% of that opportunity that we currently see. And then the last 30% is really around using hydrogen as an energy source and generating hydrogen in some cases, liquefying it in other cases, transforming that into ammonia or methanol and then moving it in some cases, long distance to ensure that markets that require ammonia and methanol or clean ammonia and methanol have access to those products. That's how I see most of those play out, both in the industrial applications as well as on the energy side, we see a role for carbon capture and sequestration. And that's where that kind of opportunity plays is a subset of the broader opportunity I mentioned.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: And we will now take our final question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Thanks for taking my question. Sanjiv, a question just as a follow-up to one of your earlier answers, you had mentioned that you were seeing some clean hydrogen or clean energy opportunities in the Middle East. I guess how would you characterize these? Are these for domestic use? Or are they for export? And if it's the latter, do you see subsidies in place, whether it's from Europe or Asian demand or what have you, that would facilitate the economics to make sense for projects like that. I guess can you help us to think about that?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So we are seeing a couple of opportunities which play into both those buckets, John. So we are seeing carbon capture sequestration opportunity that we are jointly working with Aramco and Schlumberger on a feed is undergoing at the moment. It should get to FID early in the New Year, where we're looking at a very large scope of carbon capture. In fact, the first phase where we are currently working on is 11 million tonnes of CO2 a year out of a total project, which may be the world's largest carbon capture and sequestration project in 3 phases, adding up to 54 million tonnes per annum of CO2 being sequested. So that's a domestic -- that's driven really around the domestic decarbonization effort that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is pursuing. We're also seeing projects in the Kingdom and elsewhere in the Middle East around the development of blue ammonia. Now the economics of blue ammonia coming out of - coming out of the Kingdom or the Middle East more broadly is very, very competitive. So although there are no direct or broad incentives available, there are specific project-based incentives that the government will provide. And some of that product is then used to serve local markets. I'd say probably a split about a third to two third, two thirds for export, one third for local markets. But the product that comes out of blue ammonia in particular that comes out of the Kingdom and other parts of the Middle East is very competitive globally.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call back to Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you again for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out. Have a safe day. Take care.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 12:35:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde plc First Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Chris thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for attending our 2023 first quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides, and note that, it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks and then Matt will give an update on Linde's first quarter financial performance and outlook, after which we will wrap-up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Juan and a very good morning everyone. We had a strong start to the year as Linde employees once again delivered on their commitments, irrespective of the geopolitical and economic headwinds. Earnings per share, operating margin, and return on capital all reached new record highs. Robust pricing, coupled with dependable return on capital have more than compensated for a weaker economy. Just like the last four years. Linde's ability to consistently deliver earnings growth in any environment is a testament to the resilient portfolio, operating excellence, and capital discipline. And when global economies recover, which they always do, there's an opportunity to further leverage the base volume growth just as we've demonstrated in 2021. However, during uncertain times like today, we continue to execute our strategy of optimizing our base business every day, capitalizing on growth projects, including high-quality clean energy projects. All of this while maintaining our industrial gases model, coupled with a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Slide three provides a brief update on clean energy, including key projects that are both under construction and an example of a project being developed. Let me begin by reiterating our strategy with respect to clean energy and you'll notice it hasn't changed over the last three years, which it shouldn't. Let's start with the first principle. We will stick to the core of industrial gases model. This has been a cornerstone of our strategy for decades. We are experts at designing, building, operating, and distributing industrial gases and equipment. We serve many markets where our customers are experts at what they do, making our customers more productive and competitive through our core strengths is what makes Linde successful. This has been true for the last 100 years and I expect it will continue to be true for the next 100. Another certainty within our industry is how customers demand the same three requirements for the gas supply, which are safety, reliability, and lowest total cost of ownership. This holds irrespective of the molecule, the end market or supply mode. This is why a key element of our strategy is to leverage our world-class engineering capabilities and existing asset network of our $3 billion hydrogen business to deliver the most reliable and lowest-cost supply systems for our customers. Following these principles, we've successfully won and advanced many clean energy projects, of which I'd like to highlight just a few. The left side represents projects currently under construction. These are projects with executed contracts, fixed payments and incremental growth with predictable returns. With project CapEx of just under $2 billion, including the new OCI project in Texas, where Linde will supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen by capturing CO2 for underground sequestration through our partner, ExxonMobil. Currently, this project makes up the majority of clean energy projects in our backlog since most electrolyzer investments are designated for the merchant market and therefore, considered base CapEx. There are a few projects like the recently announced Evonik agreement that meet backlog criteria. But even here, we support local network and supply high-purity clean hydrogen to electronics and other industrial customers as well. Currently, we view these electrolysis -- electrolyzer projects as modules in our local supply network for supply of merchant hydrogen. They're often integrated into our existing hydrogen network, sometimes side by side leveraging the same storage and transportation infrastructure, helping optimize distribution costs. Furthermore, these projects leverage various electrolyzer technologies, including PEM and outline to provide the best fit to customer needs. Sale of Plug is another avenue for Linde to participate in growth opportunities, which may have different customer demands or which may not benefit from integration with our existing supply network. Now in addition to these projects being constructed, we have over 200 different projects under development. Of course, the profitability of these projects being approved or won by us varies from project to project. On the right side of the slide, I'd like to highlight one such opportunity which was recently made public by our customer. Dow recently announced that it has selected Linde as an industrial gas partner for supply of clean hydrogen and nitrogen for its proposed net 0 carbon emissions integrated ethylene cracker site in Alberta, Canada. Under the framework agreement, Linde will complete the design and engineering for a Linde owned and operated world-scale air separation, autothermal reformer and carbon capture complex. This complex will potentially be integrated with Linde's existing operations in Alberta. Engineering work is underway, and both companies are working to obtain their respective board approvals and regulatory approvals. Final investment decision is anticipated by end of the year. So I don't really have many additional details until then. We continue to work on a number of other projects aligned with our strategy to decarbonize our own operations, help customers decarbonize their operations, such as the Dow project above and address new market needs such as the OCI project. Overall, the total opportunities are likely to exceed $50 billion over the next decade representing one of the best long-term growth environment I've seen in a long time. Of course, time will tell how many we ultimately sign and announce, but you can see we are making meaningful progress. And despite the many differences across these projects, our full suite of offerings, coupled with a strong balance sheet, will enable us to win more than our fair share. But rest assured, our participation will consistently follow our strategy and proven investment criteria. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers.
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to slide 4 for an overview of first quarter results. The sales of $8.2 billion were flat with last year, but up 4% sequentially, versus prior year, FX was a 3% headwind. Although we continue to see foreign currencies strengthen as evidenced by the sequential tailwind. Cost pass-through was also a headwind as energy prices have fallen in most parts of the world. As a reminder, we pass through power and natural gas costs contractually, which have no effect on profit dollars but will impact profit margins. Net divestitures resulted in a 2% decrease as the sale of GIST and deconsolidation of Russia more than offset the recent -- nexAir acquisition in the United States. Engineering is down 2% since we have not lapped the impact from sanctioned Russian projects, which ceased Q2 of last year. Excluding these items, underlying sales increased 8% from last year and 3% sequentially. The Inflation levels remain elevated in most countries and thus are driving higher pricing. As mentioned in prior calls, globally weighted inflation tends to be the best proxy for our price changes since most contracts have clauses that specifically address local inflation. Volumes were flat from prior year as contribution from project start-ups offset lower base volumes. When looking at segment-based volumes, Americas are growing due to the US APAC is mostly flat since volume recovery is offset by prior year equipment sales. And EMEA is lower, primarily from on-site customers adjusting to slower economic conditions. From a supply mode perspective, we continue to see resilient or growing packaged and merchant volumes. Although, certain on-site customers are lower from a combination of weaker conditions than planned turnarounds. Sequential volumes are flat as US pipeline recovery from Q4 weather offset seasonal slowdown in APAC and Latin America. Despite flat volumes, operating profit of $2.2 billion increased 16% from prior year and 10% sequentially. This growth was driven by project start-ups and prudent inflation management through price increases and cost productivity efforts. These actions resulted in a record operating margin of 26.9%. And you can see to the right that every segment contributed to this improvement. In the appendix, you'll notice the engineering segment once again delivered an operating margin in excess of 25% above the low to mid-teens we view as a long-term run rate. Similar to last quarter, this is due to favorable timing from the wind down of sanctioned projects. While this led to favorable benefits on the income statement, it also resulted in unfavorable cash timing, which I'll discuss on the next slide. For the next few quarters, engineering results may continue to be lumpy as we wind down the remaining projects. However, we did not include any potential profit upside in the earnings guidance. EPS of $3.42 was 17% above last year or 20% higher when excluding the effects of currency. This represents the 10th quarter in a row of growing EPS ex-FX, 20% or more. From a cash flow perspective, CapEx increased 28% from growth investments in both base and project CapEx. Furthermore, ROC reached another record at 24%. And as we continue to deliver double-digit percent profit growth on a stable capital base. Slide 5 provides more details on the first quarter capital management. While cash trends are relatively steady, the Q1 operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio was 64% or 11% lower than last year. The majority of this difference relates to timing of engineering working capital, both from a reduction in contract liabilities and an outflow from accruals and payables. So said differently, we met a contractual milestone this quarter and thus booked current income related to a customer cash deposit received over a year ago. In addition, we paid third-party vendors for work related to that project. Normally, you wouldn't experience a cash flow swing of this magnitude but the lumpy and accelerated wind-down of sanctioned projects are creating this effect. Excluding engineering timing, working capital levels remain quite healthy across the company. Overall, I expect our long-term operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio to remain in the low to mid-80% range. But the next few quarters could be more volatile as we continue to wind down remaining projects. And recall, this ratio in 2021 was 96% and driven by customer pre-payments related to these sanctioned projects. So the multiyear average is a better indicator of performance. Available operating cash flow, which represents operating cash flow less base CapEx is stable at approximately $1.5 billion per quarter. We continue to deploy cash to growth initiatives, dividends and share repurchases as part of our stated capital allocation policy. I'll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. For full year 2023, we're raising guidance $0.30 at the bottom and top end for a new range of $13.45 to $13.85. This represents a growth rate of 9% to 13% versus 2022. Note, we do not assume any FX impact since currencies have mostly recovered. The $0.30 raise comes from the outperformance of the first quarter. In other words, we left alone the remaining quarters for now. In addition and consistent with our prior approach, this assumes no economic improvement and hence, no base volume improvement. This does not represent our macro projection, but rather is just a placeholder. So you can insert your own view of the economy and adjust accordingly. If the economy improves, we'll be above this range. And if not, we'll take actions to mitigate. The second quarter EPS guidance range is $3.40 to $3.50, representing 10% to 13% growth from 2022 or 11% to 14%, when excluding a 1% FX headwind. Similar to the full year, this assumes no economic improvement from current levels. Although on a sequential basis, it reflects some seasonal recovery, partially offset by lower engineering. Overall, we had a strong start, but one quarter doesn't make a year. We believe it's appropriate to remain cautious while continuing to manage the things within our control, including price, cost and capital discipline. But regardless of how the year unfolds, we're highly confident we can continue to deliver compound value for our shareholders by executing on the basics and securing high-quality customer contracts for long-term growth. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Your line is open.
Mike Leithead: First question, I wanted to focus on EMEA segment. Can you just speak to the step change in profitability here this quarter? I appreciate you don't really give segment level guidance. But the business used to be running, call it, $300 million, $400 million quarterly EBIT we averaged around $500 million the quarter last year and now in a pretty uneven macro environment, we broke $600 million. So is this sort of the right run rate going forward, or is there something else kind of underlying the step up here?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Mike. Let me start off by just kind of going back and telling you how the EMEA business have been looking at actions they need to take, management actions. So the underlying impact that we're seeing come through is driven by two levers: pricing and productivity. Productivity are actions that they've been undertaking for an extended period of time, as you're aware, we've talked about it over the last couple of years now. So they've reset their cost base effectively and continue to do that every quarter. That obviously has an impact on the run rate that you're seeing going forward. But more importantly, we're obviously seeing some upside from pricing come through. And you might recall, if you go back late 2021, when inflation started moving up, we'd explained to you that there is a catch-up that happens around pricing, particularly around merchant and package businesses. Of course, in the current environment, when energy costs are coming down as an example, we're getting some uplift as a result of that as well, which you can see in that pricing number pretty impressive 13% that they have posted. So you have to keep those in account as you think about EMEA's business, but underlying performance driven primarily around pricing and productivity.
Mike Leithead: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Nicola Tang: I wanted to ask a little bit more about this $50 billion opportunity that you about now in terms of clean hydrogen. I think two quarters back when you talked about that greater than €30 billion opportunity. You're talking about the U.S. alone, but you broke it down into those three buckets of decarbonize Linde's decarbonize customers in new markets. So I was wondering if you could do the same on under the extra €20 billion, which I guess is outside of the U.S. And perhaps in terms of geography, you could talk about where you expect to see the most momentum in the next couple of years in terms of project findings. Thanks.
Matt White: Thanks Nicola. So again, just to remind you, we -- I talked about earlier in my remarks, 200 -- more than 200 projects that we are currently developing. The whole segment that for you is by application that should help. So there are three key buckets in which we see these projects being developed. There is a mobility bucket. Then there is industrial application and the ones in our wheelhouse, the ones where we are currently working with existing industrial customers to help them decarbonize and then the last piece is really around energy and power, where hydrogen or its carrier, ammonia or methanol will play a role. So let's split them down when I think about a $50 billion, let's flip them down and say, well, mobility is around 10% of that. We see industrial applications, really the dominant part of that opportunity set at about under the balance is large, but fewer projects around energy and power. So that's one way to think about it. As you know, and as you mentioned, Nicolas, we've already reached out and said previously $30 billion plus in the U.S. driven, of course, with momentum coming out of the IRA driving a lot of that development. So you see the balance $20-odd billion that we're talking about outside of the U.S. We're seeing growth opportunities in our pipeline out of the Middle East. We're seeing growth opportunities come out of Mainland Europe, some in the U.K. And then, we are seeing a little bit of a buildup happen out of Australia and Asia, and it does look like they will be behind the curve relative to what the U.S. and Europe is likely to see.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Hi. Thanks very much. In late January, ExxonMobil indicated that it wanted to build a hydrogen facility or hydrogen complex in the United States. That would generate about 1 billion standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen, which is Kryotechnik. Can you talk about how you see the hydrogen market evolving in North America now that it seems that ExxonMobil wants to enter it, do you see other integrated oil companies as entering the hydrogen market as well? Do you see them in hydrogen in a way that's different from the way you sell it? Can you give us an idea of what that market looks like over the next few years competitively?
Matt White: Sure, Jeff. So as you think about the evolution of the hydrogen market, there are three aspects to keep in mind. The first that a lot of the development around clean hydrogen is driven through a range of partnerships. And you'll recall, when Linde laid out our strategy, we said that partnerships are a key component of that. And you heard me speak earlier and mentioned that ExxonMobil will be a partner for us as we look at sequestering the CO2 downhole as well. So just to keep in mind that, that's one of those developments, and we are actually partnering with a number of players, including IOC's and NOC's that have an intent to try and develop their own projects around hydrogen because they're lean on us to provide either technology operating experience or indeed, sometimes the benefit of our network. So that's one. The second thing to keep in mind is we have the ability to leverage our existing infrastructure that we have built over decades that supports that $3 billion business that we have in the US Gulf Coast. And really, I think that's where a competitive advantage for Linde turns up. Very often, other partners or potential partners reach out to us because they recognize the impact and advantage that we carry as a result of that infrastructure investment and want to partner with us as well. So that's the other piece to kind of keep in mind. The last a number of players will want to decarbonize their operations. And what you're speaking about the specific example, Jeff, is driven around decarbonization of their operations in Baytown. Here, what they're attempting to do is to actually produce significant hydrogen. You mentioned one billion cap. And a large portion, if not most of that will actually go into decarbonizing their own operations, obviously, the support from 45Q makes that more attractive, makes the hydrogen going as an input into their crackers into their chemical systems, downstream and to the refining systems, a lot more attractive from a pricing point of view. And you're seeing that is a development that's happening. I'm pretty hopeful that we will have a role to play in those projects that people like ExxonMobil and others will undertake through the provision of our technology and operating capabilities as well.
Matt White: And Jeff, this is Matt. Maybe just one other thing I'd add. I think another way to think about it is -- when you look at the hydrocarbon market today for transportation and energy, it's somewhere in the order of a $6 trillion market. My number may not be exact, but it's something in that order. And when you look at the industrial gas industry, our participation in that market is a fraction of a percent. So in my view, a lot of that $6 trillion market is what is being addressed and potentially converted to things like hydrogen, and so if that happens, I think that actually creates opportunities in areas that we had a very, very small participation in, in the past. But time will ultimately tell.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yeah. Good morning. Two questions really. One, around the projects. So the OCI, the Dow roughly, what would be the cadence you would expect announcements like that over the next three or four years? Is it three or four years? Is it more than that? And then two, Matt, on your guidance, you said you're putting in no volume improvement, but that's not your base case. Could you talk about just what you're seeing macro-wise volume in what you would expect this year? What would be a decent base case?
Matt White: Duffy, I'll start off by just talking about the clean energy projects. And I think the important thing to remember there is that these projects have a life cycle that they need to go through before they get announced, there is no way to predict what types of announcements and frequency of announcements you will see on these projects. I think important to maybe remind you of just the project development stages that go through. So typically, a project of this size will go through a feasibility study followed by a pre-FEED, followed by a fee, which is where you actually get to a point where you've got the quantities and the investment requirements in place based on the detailed engineering and design, which results in the FID. That all of those stages put together, would take anywhere between 18 to 24 months, in some cases, if it's a complex projects stretching up to two and a half years. Beyond that, you will then see another two and a half to three years in execution before final start-up happens. So that's the way I think about the frequency that you would expect to see projects. These projects have been under development for a while, and you kind of continue to see those announcements reflecting the different stages these projects are at.
Matt White: And as far as the guidance, Duffy. So I'll start with -- and as you probably know, when you think about two economic metrics that might be proxies to think about would be industrial production and then CPI translation. I'm not going to tell you what we think because whatever it is, it's wrong, nobody knows what the future will bring on that. But what I can say is we continue to internally focus on a model that can quickly adapt to whatever does happen. And clearly, we're seeing inflation continue to be elevated, and we need to make sure that we can locally manage that through our contract structures to capture that inflation through pricing to make sure that we can continue to stay on top of that. On the volume side, we are well positioned to capture when it recovers. As you know, we are a contractual business. As Sanjiv mentioned, we demonstrated that in 2021 with the recovery if and when that comes back, we will be very well positioned to do that. But for now, we just left out this sort of at no improvement view, similar to what we've been doing over the last two to three years, and we'll see how it plays out. But I feel quite good that no matter what it does bring, we'll be prepared to quickly adapt and manage it.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank. Good morning. Sanjiv or Matt, just on EMEA pricing, with energy prices now falling, how should that flow through the energy price or the pricing realization in Q2 and the rest of the year?
Sanjiv Lamba: So David, I've mentioned briefly when responding to Mike earlier on that, in terms of pricing, as we've explained before -- I'll take a step back and just remind you that when we think about pricing, we think about a pass-through mechanisms, that is the on-site contracts, where we have a direct correlation between what happens to costs and energy costs in particular, but inflation and how we pass that through. The balance is also a pricing mechanism. We've explained previously as inflation was picking up in 2021, that there is usually a lag that happens at the beginning of that cycle. We are now at the back end of that cycle where you're seeing energy costs go down. And again, that same lag applies over here. We've said the lag is between one to two quarters, and we're seeing a little bit of that lag and benefiting us, of course, in terms of the pricing that we are seeing on the merchant and package side of our business. Of course, pricing takes a lot of hard work, as I've said previously on a number of occasions and our team over there has done a tremendous job in making sure that we continue to push that base price through. And of course, instances where we have surcharges, to the extent possible, we have a continuous process of converting those surcharges into base product pricing, ensuring that we have those price numbers that pricing action stick longer term as well.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on EMEA volumes, do you expect EMEA volumes to be down for the rest of the year in all three quarters?
Sanjiv Lamba: So, in terms of EMEA volumes, what we are seeing -- I'll tell you, clearly, year-on-year, we are seeing some softness in EMEA volumes, tends to be around the on-site business, in particular, chemicals and energy more specifically. On the on-site, I'd have to say sequentially, we are seeing a little bit of a pickup. It's slight particularly around metals and steel production in EMEA. So there is a little bit of a movement. Sequentially, on-site volumes are up just a little bit. So that's kind of on the on-site side. Merchant and package has been pretty flat. Now, that's good news, because we are obviously watching to see industrial activities pick up with the relative stability in energy costs that we're seeing. And as that happens, we will see some volume leverage come through in the rest of the year. Of course, we're tracking this carefully. I'm not going to try and predict what's likely to happen in Europe, given the many factors that are at play. But if that happens, we are well positioned to kind of find the leverage around our base volume growth that's likely to happen as a consequence.
David Begleiter: Thank you, very much.
Operator: The next question is from Peter Clark from Société Générale. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Yes. Two questions. First, on -- back on the pricing and the sequential price you're still getting in America, is the question. One of your competitors was mentioning a big kick-up in medical gas pricing, and I think that was led by the Americas for them as well. So I'm just wondering if your medical gas price has seen a kick or you're already ahead of the pack on that. And then the second question around Europe and the cylinder business. You've alluded to the fact it's been doing pretty well, certainly on the pricing and the margin side. I'm just wondering if it's leading that, because, again, we're hearing it's still very robust on pricing. The volumes for your competitors also were pretty good in Europe on the cylinder side. So just wondering, if that is a real driver between that margin kick you're seeing underlying in Europe? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Peter. So on pricing, I can say to you that you've seen robust pricing over the last three quarters, consistently across all our segments, and I think we're pretty happy with how pricing has played out. I'm not going to get into the details around what is specifically happening around medical or healthcare piece. Again, across the board, most of our businesses, most end markets have seen strong pricing growth. And I think we're pretty satisfied with where we are, and we tend to lead the industry as far as that pricing growth is concerned. In Europe, package, that's a great question. I think we watch this very carefully. The good news is on the volume side, those volumes have been holding well and have been very resilient through the last 18 months or so. So that's really been an important piece. Pricing has been very good. I mentioned EMEA pricing more broadly. Clearly, the package side of that has benefited from that as well and has shown strong pricing performance over that entire period; including the first quarter that we are now referencing. I certainly expect to see, as industrial activity picks up -- so an important factor in all of that was stability in energy costs. That seems to be in place at the moment, Peter. I think it's still open what longer-term impacts there might be. But at least in the short to medium term, we are seeing that stability play a role in some level of -- a very slight pickup, if you will, in industrial activity across the board and that certainly helps the merchant and package business. So I would expect to see that volume trend play out as we see those developments continue.
Peter Clark: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open. 
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I would like to better understand the mechanisms by the pass-through cost. Is there a month or multiple months delay in how that is passed through, given natural gas costs in the US and Europe have plunged and yet your cost pass-through was fairly neutral. Is that another lag effect similar to the comment you made on European pricing. You have this lag effect. These two things combined did they represent some operating profit in those regions in the first quarter that really was just driven by lag?
Sanjiv Lamba: Okay. So let me start off by just, kind of, providing a headline that says as far as pass-through is concerned, there is no impact on our operating profit in dollar terms. It's kind of adds to the top and it doesn't add anything to the OP. And when it's on its way down as it is at the moment, it goes away from the top and doesn't add any dollars from an OP point of view. Of course, it does impact the margin numbers and the mathematical combination of the margin does improve as a consequence of that when you're on a down cycle as far as costs are concerned. Addressing your specific question, contractually, we're able to manage the pass-through on, I would say, what I would consider a real-time basis. So effectively, our contractual invoicing methodology would allow us to pass it on every week, fortnight or a month, depending on how the contracts are structured. There isn't any significant lag, as I mentioned, on the pricing action for merchant and package where there tends to be a lag of one to two quarters, not in the case of pass-through.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
Michael Sison: Hi, guys. Nice start to the year. Just a follow-up on the clean energy opportunities. How much of your sale of gas backlog is Clean Energy now? And then if you're successful in winning your fair share, how big do you think that backlog will be for clean energy down the road? And is there a limit on how much you can put in your backlog?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Mike, at the moment, I think, I referenced this earlier. We've got about just under $2 billion. That's what the slide would show you in the sale of gas. We got about just under $2 billion of backlog coming out of decarbonizing projects, if you will. Our expectation is that in the next two years to three years, we will be making investment decisions anywhere between $9 billion to $10 billion worth. This is based on the projects we're developing, which are further advanced than others. And those decisions, depending on the ones that we pursue and win and sign up will then get moved into the backlog and would then start providing the impact that we look for once they start up in due course. So you can expect the backlog to continue to grow. I do not expect it to peak up and down. I expect it to be a reasonably steady growth in the backlog over the years ahead. And that decision -- those decisions that we make in clean energy projects that I've referenced before of anywhere between $9 billion to $10 billion over the next three years will determine what finally happens in that backlog.
Michael Sison : Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask on the buyback. I would have guessed given the delisting from Frankfurt that -- and the big cash balance at the end of the year that you might have put more money to work in the first quarter in the buyback, but it didn't look like you had to -- so given that you're still sitting with a pretty large cash balance, I guess you did the packaged gas acquisition, but how are you thinking about using that cash balance and the incremental capital you generate in free cash flow this year in terms of return of capital to shareholders?
Matt White: Sure, Vince. This is Matt. Specifically to Q1, you may recall for pretty much the month of January, we were officially blacked out from any buybacks at all, given the nature of the merger structure that was used to do the delist. So we lost about a month or so, and therefore, we had less days to act, but we did get pretty, I would say, aggressive leading right up to it and as we saw some good opportunity there. But looking forward, it really is just going to be a consistent approach to our long-standing study simple capital allocation model. And to reiterate for those on the call, it starts with our underlying mandate, which is we're going to maintain a single A rating and grow the dividend every year. That is a mandate -- and then our priority after meeting that mandate is to invest in the business. And that is anything that meets our investment criteria. It's acquisitions, it's decaps, it's projects, it's base CapEx. We treat them the same as we should because these are long-term investments and we need to evaluate them on risk return against our core model. And then whatever is left over is going to be buybacks. So based on our current cash profiles, we continue to have substantial capital left over. And therefore, we will be buying in the market pretty much almost every day. And as we continue to see opportunities, we'll step that up. But that capital allocation policy will be very consistent through good macro times and bad macro times, and that's something that you can rely on for us for the long haul.
Vincent Andrews : Great. Thanks for the update. Operator: The next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Dan Rizzo : Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned earlier, I think, about your outlook having -- no, not assuming any really improvement in the macro environment. I don't know if I missed this, but can you meet your guidance if the macro environment in North America in particular, significantly weakened?
Matt White: Sure. This is Matt. I can handle that. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and first of all, our approach is very consistent in how we've been approaching this for the last couple of years, frankly. And we believe our view of the economy is not going to be any more accurate than anyone else's. So we'll just put a baseline there and no improvement and let you put your house view in whatever that may be. So in the case of if the macro deteriorates, we will take actions to mitigate. Clearly, we saw that in 2020 and we took actions. And you may recall, our full year EPS growth rate in 2020, it was close to 12% growth rate. So those actions did help mitigate what was a pretty unexpected macro decline from the pandemic. Similarly, last year, in 2022, we saw some macro softness related to the energy crisis and obviously, the invasion. And so given those, we have a track record of being able to act in case those disruptions happen, and as I mentioned to Duffy, that's how we build our operating rhythm is to be able to quickly respond when things are different in the macro than what was expected. So, I view this the same, time will tell. But given our base is very local, we can react locally to what happens locally because, as you know, the macro and every country may be different. And that's how we need to approach it.
Dan Rizzo: Thank you, very much.
Operator: The next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. Sanjiv, can you provide an update on your carbon offtake strategy last quarter, I think you indicated you were in discussions with three companies. And earlier this month, we learned that you've chosen to partner with ExxonMobil. My understanding is that partnership relates to OCI Beaumont specifically. So, a couple of questions would be, in the case of future blue hydrogen projects, do you need to navigate the offtake each time on a case-by-case basis? And also, can you comment on the costs and recovery of those costs as you negotiate these projects? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Kevin. So the last time we spoke about this, I mentioned that there are two ways in which we look at the storage, the capture and storage of CO2, particularly for blue hydrogen projects in the US. And really, that's driven around the IRA benefits that come out of 45Q providing that $85 per tonne of CO2 to be captured and sequester. And the two models I mentioned was a tipping fee, i.e., where Linde would on the capture and would create a pipeline that would then provide that CO2 to a partner who would take a tipping fee and sequester and manage that storage on the ground. The other option was for us to sell the CO2 that we have and allow the partners to take the benefit of whatever tax credits that come as part of 45Q through their ownership of the carbon capture and sequestration process and the assets that they build in order to achieve that. We've mentioned that we were in conversations with a number of players. And as you read from the announcement, we selected and worked with ExxonMobil to continue down that path. That's where the OCI -- the CO2 coming out of the OCI assets and the production of blue hydrogen would be passed on or offtaken by ExxonMobil and sequested to buy them and manage long term. As we think about new projects and that we are currently developing, we have an opportunity to work with partners, including ExxonMobil and others to look at it on a case-by-case basis, given that we have a well-established model with ExxonMobil, we will pursue that with them, but it does depend, in some extent, to some extent, on the geology and the infrastructure available for us to be able to sequester this in dorms on the ground and therefore, we will work with other partners as well in the US to kind of progress and move forward on that basis. As far as cost recovery is concerned, the 45Q credits are reasonably well understood. The fact that for the first five years, we have a direct pay mechanism that for the balance period of seven years to make up that, we have a tax credit that goes below the line, I mean, recognizing that we're trying to build as much flexibility into the operating models that we want to pursue in those conversations we're having. One of those has been decided with ExxonMobil, the others will just follow and we've kind of worked that on a case-by-case basis.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Geoff Haire with UBS. Your line is open.
Geoff Haire: Yeah. Good morning. I just had a quick question on Asia. I noticed that on volumes, you were sequentially down 4%. I just wonder how that plays out for the rest of the year or there was something specific in Q1? And then just one small question additional, if you don't mind, I think Matt you said that there were some issues around the engineering business and the cash flow. How does that play out for the rest of the year, just given obviously, as you wind down the Russian businesses or projects?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Geoff. So I'll take the Asia piece, and I'll let Matt respond to you on the cash flow. So -- just as a quick reminder, Geoff, the first quarter in Asia is usually impacted by seasonality. The Lunar New Year has a big impact across that region. So you'll see that. And when you see sequential movements that's something to keep in mind. Now however, let me just give you kind of a snapshot of what we're seeing in Asia anyway. Year-on-year sales are growing. They are pretty strong across food and beverage, health care, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, Electronics also was strong growth in the first quarter, but that was primarily new startups. As far as electronics is concerned, we are seeing some marginal weakness. So you can see that in the sequential movement in the end market slide that we provided. We think most of that is coming out of memory feedback from customers suggest that we're likely to see that kind of a normalization of activity in the second half, probably towards the back end. I've also mentioned previously, and I think we see that trend continue, Geoff, in terms of China, feel volumes being soft. We continue to see that in Q1 as well. And of course, One of the things to keep in mind when you think about the year-on-year movements is that we had some SOE sale of equipment sales that happened last year, which kind of doesn't help with the comps when you look at it year-on-year. But sequentially, primarily Chinese New Year impact or the Lunar New Year impact across the region and then the movement that I mentioned to you across the different end markets. Matt?
Matt White: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Sanjiv. So Geoff, I can start with when you think about engineering, it follows what's called percent of completion accounting. And the basics of that, for the most part, we get paid in advance. So it's negative working capital, which is a good thing. And essentially, what happens is the customer will pay us in advance of a project, and then we will debit cash and then we'll credit what's called a contract liability. And then over time, we work against that contract. And then as we recognize that work, that would go to the income statement and then we would reverse a portion of that liability and it would go and be recognized as revenue. And in a normal project, that's about a three, maybe four year very structured, very well disciplined and defined engineering build rate. And that's what you've seen from us essentially since the merger, right, for the last four years. In the case of the sanctioned projects that obviously created an event where we needed to immediately stop all work in Q2 of last year. Now the good news is our contracts address this. They have what's called a suspension clause, but you can imagine in these contracts, what we do primarily is what's called E&P, Engineering & Procurement. We really don't do much construction. So with the E, that's our labor internally and the P are things we are procuring around the world from vendors in China or Europe or the United States. So when you get a contract in suspension like we've had due to sanctions, you have lots of work you've accomplished, but you have to go through a process to determine at what point and how to build that with the customer. So that takes time, sometimes many quarters, and it could be very lumpy. And so that's what's creating this volatility. And what you'll see in the 10-Q when we issue that later today, is the total contract liabilities for engineering as of the balance sheet date, so end of March stands at about $4 billion. So again, what that means is we received $4 billion essentially in customer payments, of which we have yet to work off. Now within that, 1.8 billion are specifically part of projects that's been sanctioned. So that's kind of the number we're working with in -- within that 1.8, $1.2 million is one specific project called RCA, that will probably take some time to address. My view is it could be a year or more. So it's the remaining $600 million that are a handful of projects that were substantially close to complete, we've done a substantial amount of work. And that's the portion that will probably create some volatility looking ahead in the next few quarters as we resolve. But I would say all in, these are projects that had good contracts. We were paid in advance then we've done a substantial amount of work and it will just take time to get the final recognition given the process of suspension that the contracts address.
Geoff Haire: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Roberts: Thank you. Do you think the new EPA greenhouse gas proposed rules for power plants will drive US adoption of ammonia combustion, which could help your hydrogen backlog, or do you think it's going to simply accelerate the replacement of coal-fired power plants?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, that's a very complex question. I'm not sure I'm going to do justice to it in this call, but I would say to you, there are three things that we are considering. Clearly, when we think about the thermal power plants, they have a couple of avenues to work through. What we're seeing in Japan and Korea, as an example, is ammonia lending. So it is possible they currently have a number of pilots successfully operating there going up to 20% to 30% of ammonia in thermal plant usage to bring down emissions by a significant amount. So yes, I do believe that we will see some level of ammonia blending as part of the development to manage emissions around thermal power plants. The other piece that is obviously being worked on at the moment is to see if direct injection of on into new power turbine would be effective. Again, there's a 40-megawatt part turbine that's currently operational, being piloted on this. Initial results seem to suggest that it looks promising. And therefore, I would see ammonia potentially benefit longer term as a direct power source for such path turbines as and when they get kind of deployed and installed. Lastly, there is always the option to consider, right? It's hard to abate. But there's always the option to consider given the geology in the US in particular, the opportunity to try and capture even though it's small kind of levels of CO2 in the emissions to try and capture that and sequester it as another option, particularly made a little more attractive with the 45Q tax credits that become available as well. So we think there will be a combination of things that will happen. We are working with OEMs on the ammonia injection. We're working with partners to look at ammonia development to support that injection, but all of that will take time to play out.
John Roberts: Thank you. Nice quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you so much. You had a little on your backlog commentary and what you plan to deploy. But can you just talk about the prioritization and about the $3 billion of Linde specific projects you've previously been highlighting? Thank you so much.
Sanjiv Lamba: Chris, you're right. So, I mean when we go back and look at what we put out earlier on when we talked about the $30-plus billion we said decarbonizing our own operations, to invest about $3 billion. We have about 11 assets in the US Gulf Coast that we think would qualify for that. there is active work happening. And in fact, later today, I'll have a discussion on one of those first projects that we're looking in that space. I'd be upfront and tell you that I'm looking at a combination of two things when we make those decisions on that $3 billion that we talked about. Obviously, the timing is in our control. But what I'm looking at is to make sure that we have an asset that has a long-term contract underpinning it, so that I have the ability to generate blue hydrogen and provide that back into my customer network. And the second is to just make sure that I have an effective project that meets that investment criteria we set out. While I'm clearly committed to reducing our emissions for Scope 1, which is what happens when I decarbonize our own operations. At the same time, I'm also committed to making sure that we provide appropriate returns to our shareholders as a consequence of putting assets or money on the ground in terms of assets. We're trying to match those two to make sure that we have customers who have willingness to offtake the blue hydrogen and allow us to then go ahead with projects like that. I certainly expect to see that momentum building up in the next five to seven years, we'll see a lot more of that happen.
Christopher Parkinson: Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Hain with Stifel. Your line is open.
Andrew Hain: My most questions have been answered. Only two small ones are left. If I look on the EMEA margin and compare that with Americas and the difference, if I look on Q1, it's just 100 basis points. As you outlined that the sales margin is function of energy prices and energy prices in Europe are obviously significantly higher than in the Americas. I would come to the conclusion that at this stage, your unit margin in EMEA is basically substantially higher in America. Is that a fair conclusion? That's the first. And secondly, could you give some flavor how big this do contract might be as it is more the energy part and the product itself you delivering to? I would assume that the Dow project would be significantly smaller than that of line. And these are my questions.
Sanjiv Lamba: Andrew let me start with the Dow contract. I'll let Matt give you a little more color on the margins. Although I do want to remind everyone on the margin improvement we've seen in EMEA, which has been pretty solid. On the Dow contract, all I can say at this stage is there are many learnings that we're getting out of the OCI contract that we are applying to what we see in the Dow side Dow project that we are currently doing are feed on -- we feel pretty good about the size and scale in terms of those learnings being applied over here. But really beyond that, at this stage, it's too early to tell. We'll get to an FID before the end of the year. I expect, and I think at that stage, we'll be able to kind of properly define and tell you what that investment looks like and what the size of that asset looks like. Just on margins before I hand over to Matt, I just want to remind you that sometimes people forget, but -- and I go back to quarter four 2018 now, margins in EMEA were at about 17.5%. Since then, we've seen EMEA margins improve every year not just driven by energy, but driven by all the management actions that we thought were necessary by almost 1,000 basis points, getting us to that 27.9% that we're talking about today. So there has been a fantastic amount of effort put in by the EMEA team, and I do want to just laud that effort and say that, that gradual improvement has been absolutely spectacular in many ways. Matt, anything else to add on the margins?
A – Matt White: Sure. Andreas, and maybe it also kind of gets a little bit to Mike's first question. I think you can analyze the margins on the increment in a lot of different ways. But from my perspective, I think the way to think about it is the broader longer-term view and something we've said a lot on many calls going back for several years now, which is when you look at geographic segments of APAC, EMEA and Americas. We view them internally as essentially homogeneous-type businesses on how we operate and how we run them. And based on that view in theory, they should all be able to achieve similar margin profiles. And to Sanjiv's exact point, 2018 is the baseline when we initially merged we had very disparate margin profiles across three geographic regions that we viewed essentially homogeneously. And through the years, through a lot of great hard work -- this is not something that's easy, and it's something that takes time, we have started to see them converging. Now clearly, the Americas, who's the leader now, they're not stopping, they're not resting on their laurels. They are doing things to help continue to improve the quality of their business, and that's a lot of different actions across many fronts. But what you are seeing is a convergence. You're seeing EMEA start to catch up. You're seeing APAC start to catch up. And in my view, in theory, all three should be quite similar in the long run. And so that's how I would think about it in terms of a long-range view rather than individual quarterly analysis because at the end of the day, these businesses are quite similar.
Andrew Hain: And maybe, Matt, if I add to this, the margin you elucidate are still sales margin. If I look on that, the energy prices and energy is a very, very big input factor for industrial gases -- are completely different across these regions. If I then say that the investment might be similar for a given unit, then the capital return at the same margin would be much higher in Europe than in other regions. Is that fair looking at how an energy…
A – Matt White: Yes. I actually would disagree with that. I think we're talking about a couple of different things here, and maybe we can sort of talk about them. From a return perspective, the energy will make no difference to us, right? When we look at project investments, we look at unlevered after-tax IRRs. And as you know, in these investments, we pass through energy. So from that perspective, the energy price really does not have any bearing on how we look at cash returns. Separate and distinct when you are in a gas region that is high energy costs that may create high inflation and hence high pricing, to your point, and what we're seeing in EMEA is a higher pricing environment because of that inflation, but also realize there is a lot higher pass-through in general, which also dilutes margins. So it tends to work both ways. When you see high inflation, you may have more pricing, but you also have higher pass-throughs which will have no effect on the operating profit dollars will create a dilution effect on the margins. So this is a part of something we've been seeing for decades across many countries with inflation movements, pass-through movements, but at the end of the day, our investment view is irrespective of energy and then the way the profile works within each segment will be a function of pricing and pass-through, but these margins we view should eventually start to converge over time.
Andrew Hain: Thanks a lot
Operator: We will now take our final question from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.
Mike Harrison: Hi, there. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. A couple of questions. First of all, in terms of concerns around recession in the US, you guys actually do have some interesting leading indicators that you can look at for manufacturing within the US packaged gas business, I'm curious what you're seeing on the hard goods side in areas like capital equipment and robotics. Are you seeing any signs of a slowdown? And my second question is, now that you've brought nexAir into the fold, maybe talk a little bit more about how that deal is helping to expand your footprint and drive potential synergies? And do you see further opportunities to consolidate in US packaged gases?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Mike. Both good questions. So let me start over the US packaged gas business. And again, just to kind of recap, we had double-digit sales growth in the quarter. So that is pretty solid. Even base volumes for both gases and hard goods grew mid-single digits. Now I'd say within the hard goods space that we did see towards toward the back end of the quarter, we saw particular equipment which you are referring to, that growth was starting to trend down. Still growth year-on-year has started to trend down a little bit. And I expect that we will continue to see that as we move forward as well. So I think those -- I mean, that's the leading indicator, as you've pointed out, and we're obviously watching it carefully. I'd say to you, I'm not going to try and speculate but there will be a recession and of that state to you that whatever we're seeing at this point in time would suggest, and if there is a little bit of a downturn, it is going to be just that a little bit of a downturn. But we'll wait and see what the economy really does and track that. As far as nexAir is concerned, firstly, very happy with the fact that we closed it. As you know, we announced that it has about 400 million in top line. We have a great platform in our LG&E business, the Linde Gas and Equipment business that we run in the US, which manages our packaged gas to integrate onto that platform, to get benefit from synergies and particularly that part of country is seeing a lot of inbound investment, and we see that through the nexAir footprint that we now have in the geography in Southeast US as being very healthy, as we see new projects emerge and that should drive growth and provide an opportunity for us to cross-sell more into the established network that already exists. As far as further consolidation, Mike, I'm all for going and getting as many tuck-in acquisitions as we can. I don't think we can do many large ones. I'd love to do them if we could. But I think between FCC and other -- I don't think that's a climate that affords that. But all small tuck-in acquisitions, we continue to do. We do a number of these every year, and I certainly expect to see as many if not more this year.
Mike Harrison: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator: I'd now like to turn the call back over to Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Chris, nice job, and everyone online, thank you for participating. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a great day. Stay safe.
Operator: That will conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. And after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, Devon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2022 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during the teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's fourth quarter financial performance and outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. By all measures, 2022 was another successful year for Linde, despite the significant and unprecedented headwinds. I'm incredibly proud how every employee rose to the challenge by not only delivering record financial performance but also living our core values and supporting key initiatives for all stakeholders. And while there are hundreds of daily examples where Linde employees have created real value through their commitment and determination, I'd like to highlight just a few on slide 3. Starting with shareholders. We delivered record financial performance against the backdrop of an energy and inflation crisis not seen in half a century. Three important metrics for our owners: operating margin, EPS and ROC, all reached record highs, both for the fourth quarter and the full year. In fact, we achieved our ninth quarter in a row of growing EPS ex FX by 20% or more. On top of that, $7 billion, almost 5% of our average market cap, was returned to owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We also expanded shareholder focus beyond fundamental results by identifying persistent technical constraints on Linde's stock valuation. The Board recommended a solution to simplify our exchange listing, which is approved by an overwhelming majority of shareholders. However, achieving sustainable long-term value creation requires more than just a commitment to our owners. We need to successfully integrate all stakeholders, including employees, customers and the very communities we operate in. So on the environmental front, we continue to make great progress, and 2022 was no exception. Looking at the numbers, we added 50 additional zero-waste sites in 2022, reaching 760 sites around the globe. We reduced absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by over 1 million tons of CO2 versus 2021, despite growing volumes. This is a good start towards our stated goal of reducing 35% greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, which was recently validated by the science-based targets initiative. In addition, through the use of our technology, products and services, we help customers avoid more than 2 times the CO2 emissions from our operational footprint. These achievements have been recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, CDP and several other independent organizations. And we're not only committed to reducing our own carbon footprint, but we're also playing a major role in the global energy transition, which I'll cover later. Of course, none of this is possible without the commitment of our employees. When I measure performance and human capital, I first look to our longstanding company values of safety, integrity, inclusion, community and accountability. Our safety performance continues to be best in class as defined by a double-digit improvement over 2021 in lost workday cases and commercial vehicle incidents. Creating a diverse and inclusive environment where employees can achieve their full potential remains a priority for us. In support of this commitment, Linde has recently implemented a number of development programs across the enterprise. We're currently at 28% for gender diversity, and I fully expect us to exceed 30% by 2030 across the entire organization. The local nature of our business has also enabled over 500 different community engagement projects, an increase of 25% from 2021. Linde donated more than $10 million to support various charitable and STEM programs, including over $2 million in support of our Ukrainian employees and relief efforts. These highlights represent only a handful of accomplishments during the challenging 2022. However, here at Linde, we have a relentless focus on how to improve, including better positioning ourselves for the future. And while we've had four great years since the merger, I'm even more optimistic looking ahead. The $9.2 billion project backlog, which we define as contractual growth project with secured returns, increased $2.4 billion versus the third quarter due to our OCI win, which I'll talk about shortly. Additionally, 2022 was another record year for small on-site wins as the 52 new contracts will provide secured revenue for the next decade or more. With this in mind, for 2023, we expect to invest almost $5 billion in CapEx and acquisitions across all three supply modes, enabling high-quality growth while increasing asset density and reliability. Furthermore, we expect to start up over $2 billion in sale of gas projects this year, including our $1.4 billion project with ExxonMobil in Singapore. You'll recall that this project is expected to start up in phases, beginning this summer. Therefore, we'll remove it from the backlog sometime during the middle of this year. Of course, it's difficult to talk about growth today without mentioning key secular drivers. I'd like to remind everyone that a few years ago, we stated how we would leverage the secular driver of electronics capacity expansions and win more than our fair share of high-quality projects. Our current project backlog of Tier 1 electronics customers validates that strategy as we continue to lead the industry. I view clean energy opportunities as being no different. I expect to win more than our fair share of high-quality projects across the energy transition spectrum. We are already partnering with global leaders and actively developing large-scale projects with contractual terms and conditions and scope that you've become accustomed to with Linde. This approach is consistent with what I mentioned last quarter. Of course, it never hurts to reiterate. First, we intend to partner with subsurface experts for all underground operations. We're not geologists. Secondly, all projects will follow our investment criteria. In other words, earn a commensurate return for the risk undertaken. And finally, we will stick to our core, which is management of industrial gases. We have no interest to own or speculate on globally traded chemicals. Rather, we'll have offtakers for our products. Our recent win with OCI perfectly aligns with these principles, which you can find on slide 4. We will invest $1.8 billion as the long-term supplier of nitrogen and blue hydrogen into OCI's ammonia facility with terms and conditions and a return profile consistent with our traditional on-site contracts. OCI is an expert in ammonia production, logistics and marketing, something Linde doesn't want to engage in. In addition, we are partnering with a world-class oil and gas company for the CO2 sequestration. This blue hydrogen project is a great start, and we have several more large-scale energy projects under development. These opportunities follow our traditional gas model and involve partners that are global leaders in their space. In addition, we will continue to execute in our base business, managing pricing, productivity and increasing density across all three supply modes because we recognize that our owners appreciate the resilience of the industrial gas model. Overall, 2022 was another stellar year despite the many headwinds. We achieved new highs across several key financial metrics whilst relentlessly focusing on our core values. This is the fourth year in a row of double-digit EPS growth, and I see no reason why this won't continue. Stated simply, I have confidence that we will deliver strong results irrespective of economic and geopolitical climate. From my vantage point, I've never been more confident about Linde's future. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers.
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to slide 5 for an overview of the fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.9 billion were down 5% from prior year and 10% sequentially. Note that underlying sales increased 7% year-on-year but decreased 2% sequentially. So, there are several moving parts distorting the trends. First, you can see FX down 6% year-on-year due to the strong U.S. dollar. This trend has already started to reverse as evidenced by the flat sequential impact. I'll speak to guidance at the end, but based on current FX levels, we might have some upside going forward. Divestitures from GIST and the deconsolidation of Russia resulted in a 4% and 2% headwind when compared to prior year and the third quarter. We’ll lap that part of this in June and the rest in September, although I do expect a sequential tailwind in the first quarter from our U.S. acquisition of nexAir. The engineering business decreased 4% from last year and 3% sequentially. The prior year variance is driven by Russian projects, and the sequential decline is from timing of a U.S. project. I expect a few more quarters of engineering volatility as they resolve and subsequently lap suspended Russian projects. While we ceased all Russian activity in July of 2022, we continue to reconcile balance sheet liabilities upon reaching settlements with our vendors and former customers. Cost pass-through trends are starting to stabilize with a 2% increase over last year but 3% drop sequentially. As you know, this represents the contractual pass-through of energy costs and has no effect on operating profit dollars. However, this will impact operating margins as we gross up or down sales and variable costs. Volume is down 1% from last year and 4% sequentially. This -- prior year, economic weakness in EMEA and severe weather conditions in the U.S. more than offset growth in APAC and project start-ups. Most of the slower volume came from pipeline customers. So, there's a larger impact to sales than profit given the contractual fixed payments. Versus the third quarter, volume decline is coming from weather impact to U.S. pipeline customers, EMEA's softer economy and normal seasonal impacts from Southern Hemisphere LPG. We saw a larger-than-normal amount of U.S. pipeline customer outages toward the end of the quarter from weather. This mostly occurred in December, but the vast majority of customers are back to their seasonal run rates. Therefore, this is not expected to be an issue going forward. Pricing actions remain robust with an 8% increase from 2021 and 2% from the third quarter. These increases are broad-based and aligned with the weighted inflation rate. Operating profit of $2 billion resulted in a record 25.3% operating margin. Excluding pass-through, operating margins expanded both sequentially and year-over-year in all gas segments as pricing effects net of cost inflation continue to improve underlying business quality. The engineering segment had an abnormally high operating margin this quarter due to favorable project timing. Recall that engineering follows a percent of completion accounting method. Customer cash deposits are held on the balance sheet as liabilities until we have the contractual right to bill the customer, at which point the liability is recognized on the income statement as revenue. This quarter, we settled a large contract, enabling us to retain all related cash deposits, thus recognizing the remaining liability as current period revenue. I do not expect this margin to be sustainable beyond this quarter. A lot of you are likely wondering how to model engineering going forward given the recent performance. I believe the best approach is to use the sale of plant backlog as the next 3 to 4 years of revenue with average profit margin in the low- to mid-teen percent. During times of rising backlog, cash inflows and margins tend to be higher, whereas in a declining backlog, it's usually the opposite. However, the current situation is deviating from this pattern due to the significant project wind-down from sanctions. So, we still may have a few more volatile quarters ahead. EPS of $3.16 increased 14% from last year or 20% excluding FX. As Sanjiv mentioned, this is the ninth quarter in a row of 20% or more EPS growth ex FX. Operating cash flow is down versus prior year and sequentially. This is almost entirely driven by engineering project timing. Please turn to slide 6 for a review of 2022 capital management. Operating cash flow was $9 billion for 2022 or 82% of EBITDA, consistent with our multiyear average. The business continues to deliver steady levels of cash in any economic environment. You can see to the right how we invested that cash, aligned with our stated capital allocation policy of growing the dividend, reinvesting in the business and using leftover cash for share repurchases. During the year, we invested $3.3 billion while returning $7.5 billion back to shareholders. We anticipate a meaningful step up in 2023 for new business investments while raising the dividend and maintaining a healthy share repurchase program. I'll wrap up with guidance on slide 7. For the first quarter, we’re providing an EPS range of $3.05 to $3.15, an increase of 4% to 8% versus prior year or 9% to 13%, when excluding FX. Sequentially, this range assumes that recovering U.S. pipeline volumes and an acquisition are mostly offset by China seasonality and lower engineering profit. Full year guidance is expected in the range of $13.15 to $13.55, representing an increase of 7% to 10% or 9% to 12% when excluding an estimated 2% FX headwind. Both ranges assume no material change in economic conditions at the midpoint. Furthermore, we're estimating a 4% FX headwind for the first half year and flat for the second half, although recent trends have been better. At this time, we believe it's appropriate to remain cautious against the backdrop of an uncertain environment. If the economy grows, we'll have upside. And if not, we'll take actions to mitigate like we did in 2020 and 2022. Our job of management is not to predict what will happen, but instead, execute in a volatile world and deliver on our commitments. I'll now turn the call to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. A couple part question just around the new project announcement. So, historically, a lot of the fertilizer companies used captive production. So one, I'm just wondering with this outsource, does that indicate that maybe either moving to an ATR or something in the IRA or just connected to your pipeline? Does that give you guys an advantage, particularly in the industry in general with outsourcing hydrogen going forward? And then, I just -- on the project itself, so the way to think about it, your $0.10 of op profit for every dollar of capital, we should put in about $180 million run rate kind of whenever we think that starts up in 2025. Is that a fair way to think about this?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Duffy. So, let me just take a step back and tell you why projects like this become attractive to have Linde as a partner with. And in the OCI project, as an example, there are a few things that work in our favor. And then, that kind of translates into your question as to why outsource versus captive. Linde brings a number of things to the table: one, EPC capability with a successful track record executing very large and complex projects; integrating different technology packages. You referenced ATRs. ATRs are new for many people to operate. I mean we already operate one and clearly -- at our own facility. So that advantage is something that then becomes available to people who are thinking about that outsourcing model. Add on to that the reliability that we're able to bring, which a single captive standalone unit does not have. We, of course, hope the hydrogen pipeline up to our U.S. Gulf Coast system and to the cabin [ph] that has the ability, obviously, to store excess hydrogen at times when we are able to produce more; and strong operational expertise in managing the ATR ASU complex. I mentioned to you already operate one at Clear Lake and obviously adds to that whole piece. Ammonia players, in my mind, are increasingly seeing Linde as a very complementary partner, supporting their efforts to start their expansion programs on blue and subsequently green as well. You put all of that together, I think it's a compelling argument, Duffy. As far as the return profile is concerned, and I heard some numbers there, I'd say to you the way we think about returns -- and again, this goes back to our disciplined capital and investment criteria, our -- for us, double digits unlevered post-tax returns is how we would assess a project like this. This is a traditional industrial gas project, no different to any other that we do, and that's how we would then factor the return coming back into the returns you would see hitting the EPS.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Maybe just another one on the blue hydrogen opportunities. You're in a position now where you've got a partner on the carbon sequestration side. I guess, when we think about the Q45 credits or the value of them, so maybe there's some negotiation there, I guess, how should we think about how much you capture as part of this carbon capturing that you set up versus how the sequestration gets allocated? Is there a way that we should be thinking about that or a rule of thumb? I'm sure every contract is going to be a little bit different, but your partner sounds like it's going to be a steady and long-term one.
Sanjiv Lamba: Exactly. So Duffy, let me just -- sorry, John, let me just start off by quickly kind of identifying. As you saw on slide 4, there are three components to this deal coming together. There is a customer who is the offtaker. We've defined that as a core part of our strategy. Without an offtaker, we don't develop these projects. There is the Linde scope, which is the ASU, the ATRs and the carbon capture equipment that we are investing in. The 45Q is linked back to the entity that captures the CO2. In this instance, obviously, when you think about how the project moves forward in examples like this, we are working with numerous partners, developing multiple project streams like this. At the moment, we are in advanced conversations with a number of partners for this very project. And essentially, what we're agreeing with them is potentially what you could call a tipping fee, where we would have structures which allow them to take the cost of transmitting and injecting the CO2 for storage underground and obviously managing that on a permanent basis. So, that's how you would structurally see it. Obviously, the 45Q benefits are part of that discussion and negotiation that we are currently pursuing with a couple, three different carbon sequestration experts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays.
Mike Leithead: I'll stay on the theme and ask another one on the OCI project. You mentioned it will connect to your existing pipeline. For your existing customers on that pipeline, I assume you're currently supplying them traditional gray hydrogen. I'd assume there's also now an opportunity to sell them blue hydrogen at some price or value premium. Am I thinking about that correctly? And then, when you think about your base returns or hurdle rates for this project, would those incremental home upshift opportunities, the blue hydrogen on the pipeline, be considered in your base returns, or is that, call it, potential upside from here?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Mike, you're right that there is some excess blue hydrogen that we will have out of this facility. We've obviously scoped for that. The linkage into the U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline network is both space, right? It works as a reliability factor, very attractive for OCI, at the same time, gives me the opportunity to take that surplus blue hydrogen and put it back into my system. We have demand for that blue hydrogen. And yes, there is a premium. In the past, I've explained between gray and blue, the premiums that exist, and we will be putting that into the pipeline for customers who are moving onto blue hydrogen and have the willingness to pay for it. So to that extent, whatever surplus we have, we have factored that into our economics. As you'd expect, we tend to be fairly conservative around how we model some of that stuff, and you will see that also here. Is there a potential upside longer term? There is always going to be as that transition to blue hydrogen happens.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas.
Nicola Tang: Thanks, everyone. Hi. I’m getting off theme. I'd like to ask a little bit about the buyback actually. I see that it stepped down a little bit from the usual sort of $1 billion per quarter in Q4, which I assume was due to restrictions around ahead of your AGM. If I understand correctly through the delisting process, there may be a few restrictions around your ability to pay dividends or do a buyback until you get the approval from the Irish court. So, can you just sort of clarify whether that you see any constraints in terms of your buyback or timing of the dividend around the delisting period? Thanks.
Sanjiv Lamba: Nicola, I'm going to headline that by saying I don't see any constraints, but I'll ask Matt to just give you a little more color on that.
Matt White: Sure. Hi, Nicola. So, to your two questions, I think, first, just on the buyback pace. Yes, we were -- since this is classified as a merger of the actual structure, we were essentially out of the market entirely for most of the month of December. We are back in as our traditional 10b5-1, and then it will open up again to active buybacks in a couple of days. So that would drive some of the quarterly reductions given that we needed to be officially at. As far as the Irish distributable reserves, which you're referring to on dividends and buybacks, as you know, this is the same process we went through on the original merger between Praxair and Linde AG. It is a somewhat perfunctory exercise, especially now that we have a track record in history. So, we don't see this as any issue. We are well ahead of it, and this will not affect the dividend. It will not affect the buybacks. And we've got that well accounted for. So, there's no concerns on that in my part.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: With all of the winter storms, did Linde itself have operational issues in hydrogen in the fourth quarter?
Sanjiv Lamba: Jeff, the impact of the winter storm was primarily on our on-site customers, resulting in customer outages. We were there to support them with whatever nitrogen requirements, et cetera, were there, but the outages were at the customers' end.
Jeff Zekauskas: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you, Sanjiv. Back to the OCI project, should we think about the 45Q tax credit as additive to your low-double-digit return or is it embedded in that assumption?
Sanjiv Lamba: It is -- David, it's embedded. So obviously, the relevant portions are appropriately embedded into the economic model. And obviously, double digit, as you know, is a wide range. So, it's an attractive project for us the way it comes together.
David Begleiter: Very good. And you mentioned last quarter about 30 projects you're working on, I think, in the U.S. on the back of the IRA implementation. Would we stand in additional projects, like OCI be announced perhaps in the next few months or a few quarters? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: David, I've mentioned that we have a large number of projects we're working on. We've said that we had visibility over a decade now of about $30 billion in overall terms of decisions that we expect to be making. I also mentioned that I see $7 billion to $9 billion of decisions on projects for investment over the next two to three years. And that, despite the $1.8 billion that we've now announced, I still see that $7 billion to $9 billion number as being robust in terms of decisions over the next two to three years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Clark with Société Générale.
Peter Clark: Again, it's going back to the OCI a little bit. I mean, obviously, that plays to your strengths. You can see that with the infrastructure, the pipelines and everything. Obviously, there's a lot of talk now coming out of Europe, though with a response to the IRA. And I see your footprint there. It's not quite the same as the Gulf Coast. You don't have the hydrogen pipelines, the same expense and stuff. Just wondering how you see your advantages there, if there is a real risk.
Sanjiv Lamba: So Peter, I'm going to give you the example of Germany and Leuna where we have exactly the -- that we have here in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Peter, can you hear us?
Peter Clark: Well, I think -- yes. I'm saying in Europe, you don't have the same pipeline infrastructure that you have on the Gulf Coast. So...
Sanjiv Lamba: We do. And I was going to give you an example of Germany and Leuna where we have exactly the same structure, multiple customers, pipeline network, serving refineries and chemical companies in that industrial network. So, that's an example of where we have incumbent strength. In fact, we are building our electrolyzers there to provide some green into that very pipeline network. So, that's one example where we do have the ability to expand and use that incumbent position that we have as a leverage to win more into that industrial activity and the part that we operate in Leuna in Germany. So, that's an example in Europe. What I'd say also to you is I think the nature of the projects in Europe is going to tend to be quite different, where there will be a complex producing product and then putting it into a pipeline network. Our ability, therefore, to participate in these islanded developments remains very strong. And I can also tell you that of the number of projects that I referenced previously in response to David's question, I see a number of those currently being developed in Europe as well.
Peter Clark: Got it. Can I add -- just sneak one in on trading? Just on Europe, obviously, the margin shot up. You had the volumes down. A lot of that was the on-site business. So I presume that helped you with the margin. But effectively, how you see the price/cost argument in terms of pushing the selling price through against the energy cost situation now? Because I presume most of it is through and you caught that up. So just how you see that progressing in '23? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: So Peter, the way I think about energy costs and their implications for our business is twofold, right? In terms of power cost and natural gas costs, anything that happens in terms of it going up or down gets accounted for in our contractual cost pass-through mechanism. So, if that moves up and down, yes, you will see some shifts happen as a result of that. For the rest, the way we recover inflationary impact and the way we manage our business is pricing. And as you know, we've got a 30-year track record now of positive pricing. And I see no difference -- nothing different to suggest that there'd be any different as we move forward. If fuel costs go up, we manage that through a pricing mechanism. That's the cost inflation piece. If other costs go up, we manage that through a pricing mechanism as well. One of the things that we do is we manage that through product pricing and not only surcharging. And therefore, the stability of that pricing longer term is quite sound. And we feel pretty good about where it stands and how we'll be able to cope with that as we move forward.
Matt White: And Peter, this is Matt. I would just add to Sanjiv's point. I mean, I think a good indication to see these changes you're looking for are the sequential trends. So, when you look at EMEA sequential trends in this most recent quarter, you can see that, to Sanjiv's point, pass-through is negative 6%. That is the energy pricing, that is the natural gas pricing coming down, yet pricing was up 4%. So, we're still seeing stability in the pricing levels. But of course, we are seeing large reductions in the pass-through as that energy comes in.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Sanjiv, would you comment on your expectations for China as they emerge from the Lunar New Year holiday? What are you baking in there in terms of baseline demand trajectory for '23? And then, I'd welcome any thoughts on non-China, Asia as well, taking into account your ExxonMobil project start-up in Singapore.
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So Kevin, just talking about the APAC business overall, and I'll just walk you through APAC more broadly. That would give you the color that you're looking for. Again, we had solid pricing, as you saw. We had record operating margins. They are up at 26.5%. I've said to you folks before that there's a target on the back of the Americas business, and APAC and EMEA are moving in that direction to try and bridge that gap. Sales were pretty strong in electronics, in particular, across APAC followed by chemicals energy and then a bit of manufacturing. It is a story of two halves, if you will. Ex China, again, electronics, very strong chemicals, engineering, energy and manufacturing also extremely strong, some seasonal impact of LPG business in South Pacific that you would normally expect. We see that level stable, and I'm seeing that in January, the same momentum carrying through. In China itself, in the last quarter, we saw steel automotive being reasonably weak. The Chinese New Year, obviously, in January kind of impedes our ability to really see how that recovery is going to come through given the reopening that's been touted now. I think the next couple of weeks, I'm watching carefully to see how that trend shapes up, and that's really going to determine what that long-term view on China is going to be. I said last year that I expect moderated growth out of China, and that's kind of what we've considered in our guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Roberts with Credit Suisse.
John Roberts: Is Linde interested in the disassociation of ammonia back to hydrogen and nitrogen? And I don't know if any of the OCI ammonia is targeted for export for local disassociation, but I'm more interested in general. Since there are a number of blue ammonia projects underway by companies who don't sell hydrogen and nitrogen and I guess, there could be some extra cargoes that will be available eventually in that market.
Sanjiv Lamba: John, I'll answer that in two parts. Let's talk about technology, and then I'll talk a little bit about the commercial side of things. As far as technology is concerned, Linde has some really good technology around backtracking, which is cracking that ammonia back to get -- disassociate and get hydrogen back. And we are, in fact, running pilots as we speak on some new catalysts and some new developments over there to make that a lot more efficient as a process. We're running with one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world kind of doing that -- those trials. So, I feel very good about the technology we have. I feel very good about that particular project that we're running through, and you'll hear more on that in the weeks ahead. As far as the commercials are concerned, I really struggle with this. The reality is for us to make ammonia blue or green, we put a lot of energy into that process. We get the ammonia molecule. We'll then move that molecule from point A to point B in a large ship. We will then take it to a storage at the other end, and we will back-crack it. The amount of energy loss that you see in that entire process makes the economics not viable in my mind. I don't see -- so for me, direct ammonia usage, either on the fertilizer front or direct as a fuel injection or fuel blending, makes a lot more sense in the near term. As technology changes and improves and as the energy balancing work that we are doing, in fact, in our pilot continues to improve, then it becomes a little more viable longer term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Can you provide a little more granularity on how you got the 21% sales growth in electronics year-over-year given that end market that's clearly slowed?
Sanjiv Lamba: Steve, when a fab has been constructed -- and we're talking about solid contracts with long -- Tier 1 players across the world. When a fab is constructed, they have to manage that operational elements to a point, right? So that capacity utilization works in our favor. And we are actually growing that market both in terms of ramp-ups that are happening on new fab that came up two or three years ago, and we continue to ramp our gases into increasing production that is happening over there. And in addition to that, we also continue to improve some of the molecules that we bring into these fabs given the new technologies that are there. We call them electronic special gases. That -- we are continuing to see growth over there as well. And of course, I'll always add that there is a good strong pricing element to that.
Steve Byrne: And if I could, on the OCI blue ammonia project, the 2025 start-up does seem quite ambitious. Is construction already underway? And maybe particularly for your partner, does your contract with them take effect in 2025 if their plant is not on stream? And at the other end, your -- is your partner for sequestration well on their way to getting a classic injection well? Can you comment on those perhaps key bottlenecks?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So, these projects typically take many months to develop, in some cases, years. And so, we have been working on this project for a while, Steve. So, that's the reason why we are reasonably confident about getting this up and running in 2025 and in commercial production. So, I feel pretty good about where things stand with that. Having a local engineering organization with ability to do EPC on very complex projects obviously helps and is a competitive advantage from a Linde perspective. Our customers have obviously been working on their project for a period of time as well and are well advanced in terms of their own construction activity. So again, for you, good watching that. And I am not concerned about delays on their end. Having said that, contractually, we always protect ourselves, and we have date certain contracts to ensure that we are -- if we have done the investments and done the construction that we needed to do that we are able to then ensure that our facility fees or facility charges are then paid to us on a date certain basis. Coming on to the downhole activity. We are talking to at least three, if not more, very competent world-class companies that are experts in carbon sequestration. And those discussions are progressing well. And obviously, you would expect us to do some diligence around their ability to get permits sake, where they stand in that process. Some have already applied. Others are fairly advanced in terms of their preparation. Again, we feel good about how they are kind of in terms of readiness to manage the sequestration when it comes to the pipeline.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Just sticking with that global end-market trend slide, two aspects of it. One, is this going to be the last quarter of difficult healthcare comparisons? And should that yellow box start to turn green? And then secondly, the other piece within industrial actually had the worst sequential sales growth. So, what in particular within that other bucket was driving that minus 6% sequentially?
Sanjiv Lamba: Right. So, we are about lapping the COVID volumes. Vince, you're right that we will see that largely lap now. I think the point that you can also note is a sequential movement on that suggests that we are actually headed in the right direction. You'll see that green -- the greening up of it, if you like, in the quarters ahead. So, that looks pretty much in -- along the expectations we have for that. As far as the rest is concerned, clearly, we -- there are sequential elements over here that have a range of different things. Matt has referenced most of this. I'm going to just highlight a couple of them, so I make sure that I cover that. One, we told you that U.S. on-site business saw customer outages due to the winter storm in the U.S. That obviously affected between metals and chemicals and energy. We have -- and again, you've heard this before, but I'll just repeat it. Our January trends look very good. Most on-site customers are back to seasonal run rates, in line with expectations or even slightly above. We mentioned that in our Q1 guidance already, as you might have seen. So, feeling pretty good about where that trend is in terms of the developments out of the Americas that you saw. As far as EMEA, I'll just briefly cover and let you know that from our perspective, there has been lower economic activity across EMEA for the course of this year, has been especially true on the on-site business given the volatility on the energy costs, customers in metals, chemicals and energy, obviously, impacted by that. So, volumes were down versus previous year as far as our on-site business portfolio was concerned. But again, having strong contracts and high-quality customers helps, and you can see that in the EMEA margin, which hit that 25% mark, which was a target that I'd set for them as they moved down that journey to try and bridge the gap to the Americas margin. As far as Europe is concerned, sentiment is, of course, improving. And given the stability in energy pricing, we're starting to see some volume creeping up slowly as far as that on-site business that I mentioned to you earlier on. But of course, they still remain below previous year levels, and we're just waiting and watching how that all shapes up.
Vincent Andrews: And just to that other end market, which is the bottom one on that slide, under industrial, is there anything specific in that other piece?
Sanjiv Lamba: Matt, do you want to take this?
Matt White: Yes. Sure, Vince. So a couple of things on other. Generally, what it represents, clearly, items that wouldn't fit in the categories above it represents a competitor or it would represent distributors that we don't have an actual end market identified. It is the smallest percent, so large moves could shift it. In this particular case, it's the seasonal component of LPG. That's the big driver since that is a sort of a retail component of our Southern Hemisphere business. And that just shows on the year-over-year, right? You can see the year-over-year is still up slightly. This is mainly driven by the seasonality component of some of that residential LPG component.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tony Jones with Redburn.
Tony Jones: I just wanted to ask about volumes. With the good visibility you have over the next couple of quarters, do you think some of the new projects ramping up will offset slower end-market trends, particularly EMEA, and maybe even the U.S., if things deteriorate from here?
Sanjiv Lamba: Tony, as I said, the volume trends that we were looking at in January look really good. And I mentioned the on- site customers in particular, we're seeing them back at seasonal run rate that I would expect them to be at or slightly above that. More broadly around manufacturing, we're also seeing a snapback after the holiday period, so the seasonal impact. And kind of watch out for what happens beyond that. Again, January showed us a good clear path to that in the U.S. as well. In Q4, our packaged goods, if I look at the gases and hard goods, both grew sales double digits, and we are seeing momentum continue into January on that as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning. Sanjiv, in the past, you talked about three buckets of capital. I think decarbonized Linde was $3 billion, decarbonized customers was $10 billion, and then greenfield projects was $20 billion. Are the returns on -- in these three buckets kind of similar to each other? And then, how do you go about forecasting long-term hydrogen price given that these could be 20, 30-year projects and hydrogen costs have been coming down substantially? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: P.J., let me talk about the hydrogen price quickly and then we can talk about the three buckets and how we look at them. So, as far as hydrogen price is concerned, we've been in the hydrogen business for about 50 years now. So, we've got some long-term experience around hydrogen pricing. In terms of how we think about hydrogen pricing, we look at our projects, the capital that we put on the ground and look at, as I said before, double-digit unlevered post-tax IRRs to make sure that those projects stand on their feet. You walk that back into the hydrogen pricing. And obviously, given that we lead the hydrogen market, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, we feel pretty good about being very competitive in terms of what we bring to offer. Now, the hydrogen price development that you're referencing over here is largely going to be that variability is largely going to come on the green side of things, a lot of scale-up needed. Green is neither scalable today, nor is it cost-effective today. Even with the PTC of $3 per kg that might come out of the IRA, I would say to you that the inflection point for green isn't quite there yet. I see a journey of at least 5 to 7 years there. But you're right. You'll see some pricing curves on that will kind of develop in the next 5 to 7 years to make it -- get to a point of inflection on volumes. The three buckets that we spoke about, you're right, they are three different buckets. There are two specific elements in there that you can think about the first. When we have assets on the ground in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as an example, today, when we add capture capability to that and then work with the sequestration partner to put a downhole, there is an existing asset base on to which I'm adding a little more incremental capital and getting the leverage of that installed base that I have. So clearly, the return will look more attractive. For the rest, whether it's decarbonizing our customers or new markets, we are largely setting up new assets, which will be just as we have in the OCI case, in an ASU plus an ATR plus carbon capture. You put that together, we would then again look for a traditional industrial gas contract structures and return profile where we would expect to have returns commensurate with the risk that we undertake. So, that's how I would kind of say to you that those two buckets would really play out.
Operator: Our final question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.
Christopher Parkinson: On the last earnings call, you had a very helpful slide for, I'm sure you remember, it was the IRA and accelerating the U.S. clean energy transition. Can we just hit on actually one of the smaller buckets, the decarbonized Linde? It seems like you have a lot of projects, $3-plus-billion opportunity, fairly low-hanging fruit. How should we be assessing those opportunities in terms of your prioritizations versus, obviously, the -- I'd say short, intermediate and longer opportunities with customers as well as new markets? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Chris. So, that bucket, and I referenced this briefly to P.J.'s question earlier on as well. That bucket is installed assets that we have today. There are about 11 to 13 assets that we have on our list for that, $3 billion spend that we talked about. And really, I expect that in the midterm, we will be looking at decarbonizing that. There are two drivers for that. One, we're seeing conversions and demand buildup of blue hydrogen across our existing network. So clearly, we want to make sure our assets are ready and able to supply that. The second, remember that from a sustainability point of view, we've made a commitment that we will bring absolute reductions to our Scope 1 emissions, which are coming from that installed base of steam methane reformers that we operate in the Gulf Coast. So, we will be tackling that both from a point of creating economic value, but also living up to our sustainability commitments that we made in reducing absolute scope on emissions. In the midterm, you'll see actions on all of that.
Operator: That concludes today's Q&A session. I now turn the call back over to Juan Pelaez for closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Devon, thank you, and thanks to everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out. Have a safe day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde plc Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, Cecilia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for attending our 2022 third quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides, and note that, it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks and then Matt will give an update on Linde's third quarter financial performance and outlook. After which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Linde employees once again delivered a strong quarter despite the economic challenges. EPS increased 21%, excluding FX, while operating margins expanded 90 basis points when adjusting for contractual cost pass-through, all underpinned by $2.6 billion of operating cash flow, and a record ROC of 21.8%. Now in addition to achieving this financial performance, the company recently received approval for its absolute emission reduction targets by the science-based targets initiative, confirming our road map to help de-carbonize the planet. I'm pleased to see these results, which are truly a testament to the quality of our team, and our relentless execution culture. These financial results highlight both the resilience and growth capabilities of the business in any environment. In times like these, it's important to remind investors of our stable and diversified growth trends, which you can find on slide 3. We continue to experience robust underlying sales growth this quarter, with each business segment growing double digit versus last year. Resilient end markets which make up about one-third of sales are collectively growing double-digit percent, with food beverage and electronics up almost 20% and health care slightly down from prior year pandemic volumes. Our gases are critical for the production and packaging of everyday consumer items such as food, carbonated beverages, respiratory applications, and electronic components. These volumes track to broad consumption levels rather than specific technologies, or trends. So they are quite stable even during volatile economic periods. Furthermore, despite what you may be reading in the news, we continue to see healthy supplies of gases into electronics fabs in every region. In fact, our total electronics project backlog increased to $1.4 billion, after recently being awarded a second large sale of gas contract for a major semiconductor manufacturer in the US. The bottom half of the table provides the trends for the more cyclical end markets. And similar to electronics, these trends probably don't align with what you're hearing and reading. Recall that a significant portion of these sales are underpinned by fixed payment structures independent of customer volumes, including on-site fees and cylinder rentals. It's important to note that, we spend a lot of time on contract language, to ensure our returns are protected and force majeure clauses are absolutely clear. I won't speak for the industry, but I have confidence in the strength of Linde contracts. We've demonstrated this through countless regional and global challenges, including the most recent pandemic, and so I don't see today being any different. In addition, a large portion of our customers represent the most competitive in their markets, with assets that tend to be the last ones running. A disciplined long-term approach to capital allocation continues to be validated during these challenging times. And almost 60% of sales, the cyclical end markets are also up double-digit percent. While growth is broad-based, we continue to see strength in mining for battery materials; merchant hydrogen sales; aerospace including commercial space; and general manufacturing especially in Americas. In fact, the US continues to be our best growth market as a combination of natural resource security, consumer resiliency and a strong dollar to support further economic expansion. This is especially true for the Gulf Coast, which is experiencing one of the highest investment activity in quite some time driven by lower cost energy and the ability to economically decarbonize with the passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act or IRA, which you can find on the next slide 4.  The IRA has accelerated significant growth prospects from our unrivaled hydrogen and atmospheric gas network, as well as potential new markets being developed across the US. With this effect, we've grouped these activities into three different categories of Decarbonized Linde, Decarbonized Customers and New Markets. Let me start with Decarbonized Linde, which represents the ability to sequester existing CO2 emissions generated from our own hydrogen production. This provides simultaneous benefits: the production and supply of blue hydrogen into our network, and the reduction of Scope 1 emissions for our stated sustainability goals. The potential investment to Decarbonize Linde exceeds $3 billion while considering our existing hydrogen production asset base. The second category of Decarbonize Customers, represents two separate opportunities. The first, to enable our customers to decarbonize their processes through fuel switching. That is by using low carbon intensity hydrogen, as fuel in their refineries frackers or furnaces. The second opportunity is our ability to capture and sequester, existing carbon emissions from customers, currently connected to our pipeline network especially in the Gulf Coast. This will be a revenue model similar to our current on-site business and customers would benefit by decarbonizing their own operations in addition, to monetizing tax credits over the contract period. Together our potential investment in this category could easily exceed $10 billion, which I view to be on an accelerated path given the incremental IRA benefits and the strength of Linde's existing network and asset base to support it. The third category, of new markets represents greenfield opportunities that are starting to materialize with the signing of the IRA and I expect to announce some new project wins very soon. These too, will be similar to our current on-site business with fixed payment contracts and stable returns. We estimate more than $20 billion of potential investment with some of the larger ones related to blue and green hydrogen and blue ammonia. Regardless of which projects are pursued, we plan to follow a few overarching principles. The first, we intend to partner with subsurface experts for all underground operations. We at Linde are not geologists. Second, all projects will follow our investment criteria. In other words, earn a commensurate return for the risk undertaken. Third, we will stick to our core, which is management of industrial gases. We have no interest to own or speculate on globally traded chemicals. Rather, we have offtakers for our products. Finally, it's important to understand the nature of the tax credits in the IRA. While the first five years are direct pay essentially like grants, year six through 12 are tax credits that must be used against our US tax liability up to a cap. Therefore, it's important for us to have an understanding on the monetization of these tax credits as we develop these projects whether used by Linde or sold to a third-party. Of course, we won't speculate on the market value of excess tax credits over the next decade. The IRA has accelerated the US clean energy transition. And from what we are seeing today, the total investment opportunity for Linde in the US alone exceeds $30 billion over the next decade. Overall, I'm very bullish on the clean energy opportunities in front of us and I expect to announce meaningful projects in the near-term. This secular growth driver coupled with our operating discipline and relentless focus on pricing and productivity within our base business is what gives me the confidence in our ability to keep delivering 10-plus percent EPS growth over the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers.
Matt White: Thanks Sanjiv. Please turn to slide 5 for an overview of the third quarter results. Sales of $8.8 billion grew 15% over last year and 4% sequentially. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of higher energy costs reached 8% year-over-year as energy prices continue to escalate. As a reminder this is merely a contractual gross-up and has no effect on operating profit dollars, but will dilute operating margins. This is mostly offset by unfavorable currency translation of 7% as the US dollar has strengthened against every major currency. Divestiture headwind of 1% is from the Russian deconsolidation. And the 4% growth in engineering relates to favorable timing of project billing. Excluding these items, underlying sales increased 11% over 2021. Volume expanded 3% as one-third came from the project backlog and the remainder from increases in Americas and APAC, partially offset by slightly lower volumes in EMEA. Pricing of 8% continues to be strong as all regions around the world are taking proactive and sustainable actions to recover inflation. Underlying sequential growth of 3% is driven by similar factors as broad-based price improvements and volume growth in Americas and APAC more than offset weaker volumes in EMEA from a combination of macroeconomic conditions and normal seasonal factors. Operating profit of $2 billion resulted in a 22.8% margin, which is 90 basis points above last year when excluding the effects of cost pass-through. Sequentially, operating margins ex pass-through declined 20 basis points from both weaker volumes and a lag effect of merchant and package pricing in EMEA. We still expect consolidated operating margin ex pass-through to expand more than 100 basis points for the full year. EPS of $3.10 increased 14% over prior year or 21% when excluding currency. This represents the eighth quarter in a row of EPS ex-FX growth exceeding 20%, demonstrating the breadth of Linde's portfolio. Return on capital of 21.8% reached another record from double-digit percent profit growth over a stable capital base. Our unrivaled asset network across all three supply modes enables industry leading growth without significant capital intensity, although we have ample capacity for greater investments, of which we expect to announce large wins in the near future. The ROC trend is also a result of disciplined capital and cash management. Sanjiv mentioned, how we intend to approach clean energy investments no different than other opportunities, which is an integral part of our multi-decade successful track record. Our owners expect stable long-term returns commensurate with risk, making ROC one of the most important metrics in our industry. Slide 6 provides more details on the third quarter capital management. Cash flow continues to be a key indicator of company stability and longevity, especially against the current backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty and rising interest rates. You can see operating cash flow trends with Q3 being the highest of 2022, up 24% sequentially and 3% from last year. In addition available cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less base CapEx, remains steady at $1.5 billion to $2 billion per quarter. Recall that base CapEx represents all non-project investments, of which approximately half are dedicated to growth initiatives. The right part of the slide shows how we deployed year-to-date cash flow. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is simple and stable. We have a mandate to maintain an A credit rating while growing the dividend each year. Our priority is to invest in core business opportunities that meet our criteria and any leftover cash is used for stock repurchases. Currently our metrics are better than a single A credit rating and thus we are actively recapitalizing the balance sheet. Year-to-date investments have totaled $2.4 billion between CapEx and acquisitions, of which I anticipate an acceleration based on the current set of opportunities. Finally, we've returned $6.3 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases, an increase of 31% from last year. This slide clearly demonstrates that irrespective of the macro climate, Linde will continue to drive steady long-term quality growth while sharing a substantial portion with our owners each year. I'll wrap up with guidance on slide 7. For the fourth quarter, EPS is anticipated to be $2.80 to $2.90 or 9% to 13% growth, excluding an estimated 8% currency headwind. This represents a $0.25 or 8% sequential decline from Q3 to the midpoint. There are three major assumptions driving this. First, 4% the decline is driven by engineering project timing. Engineering results are naturally lumpy due to project progress and we had a sizable Americas project billing in Q3. And while the engineering business has been streamlining the organization and rebuilding the backlog to maintain strong competitiveness and quality results, I still expect Q4 to have lower sales and profit from this timing. Second, we anticipate currency rates to worsen driving down sequential EPS by another 2%. Rates seemed to stabilize in October but we'll have to wait until January to see where they ultimately finish. Finally, we completed the divestiture of the non-core GIST business at the end of September. This had a minor effect at 1%, but we provided more details in the appendix, so you can better model the future impact. Note, we are also assuming no base growth at the top end of Q4 guidance and thus recessionary conditions at the midpoint. Consistent with prior quarters this economic assumption is merely a placeholder. So if conditions are better, we'll do better. And if they're worse, we'll take actions to mitigate. The full year guidance of $11.93 to $12.03 represents 17% to 18% growth from last year when excluding currency. The midpoint of the range is $0.15 higher than last quarter, driven by better Q3 results. Overall, the Linde team continues to execute despite the global challenges. We've demonstrated resilient, high-quality performance through recessionary conditions and 2023 will be no exception. So, regardless of what you read in the news, you can count Linde to deliver. I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Peter Clark from Société Générale. Please go ahead.
Peter Clark: Yes. Good afternoon everyone or good morning, sorry. You called out good inflation management across the gases regions. And I know you brought in White Marketing's team I think over a year ago to try and pitch best practice. Just wondering, what you added from that and how you think it gave you an advantage or a heads-up against the competition in this price inflation environment? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Peter, there are two things that I'd say that happened as a consequence of inflation coming through. You might recall Peter that very early in the process, we said that, we were looking at inflation and working through it and not believing it's transitionary. I think that's obviously been proven now. And we brought in the LatAm teams as one example of best practice within the group shared that more broadly. The difference that lies over here Peter is all about execution. And we have a relentless execution culture. That's what drives that pricing every day. You know as well that our performance culture requires that every month we sit down and review the progress that's been made. And that cadence of operating rhythm of doing that is the other piece that I think drives pricing as we look at it. Decisions are made every day. They're not made every week or every month, because they know that at the end of the month we have to have a conversation about the decisions we've made and any deviations that come out of that. It is really under driven by -- or underwritten by the performance culture of the organization.
Peter Clark: And can I sneak in a little one. On the European smaller customer, medium-sized customer, industrial customer, are you seeing any change in behavior at all? Because we've heard other companies getting quite concerned about how these small customers are suffering in the current environment.
Sanjiv Lamba: Peter, there are a couple of ways to address that. As I look at the different end markets and obviously, we're paying a lot of attention to the medium and small-sized customers across Europe, there are two factors that we particularly look at. One is what's happening to receivables. And I can confirm to you that cash generation receivables remain within expectation, which I think is a very important indicator as to how the markets are currently responding. I'm not going to predict what's likely to happen in the next quarter or beyond, but I can say for now that, I think we've seen that accounts receivable reflect a certain amount of resilience across that customer base as well. The other piece I'd just mention to you is, when you look at EMEA volumes and I know you see a minus three over there, if you strip out the significant pandemic impact that came out of the health care, for most other end markets, volumes remained reasonably stable. Yes, they've softened a little, but they remain reasonably stable. And that includes the small and medium-sized customers as well.
Peter Clark: Perfect. Thank you, very much.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning guys. Just a couple of questions around your slide four and the Inflation Reduction Act. So, first, if you look out maybe two or three years, how much can it absolutely grow your backlog do you think? What kind of bogey should we have for backlog increase? Second, what percent of that do you think will end up being sale of gas versus sale of plant? And then just the last one, relative to the size of your typical projects historically, what do you think the average size of the projects around the IRA will be?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Duffy. Let me start off with the backlog question first. As you will recall, Duffy, in the past calls, I've talked about a probability weighted number of about $5 billion. That's obviously a global number. Today, when I look at that number, that's trending close to $7 billion to $9 billion. Remember, we tend to be quite conservative. These are decisions in the next two to three years. And I'm expecting something of the order of $7 billion to $9 billion in actual decisions around projects in the next couple of years related to this obviously accelerated in part by the IR and those decisions will obviously then end up in the backlog, given the size of these projects.  As far as sale of gas and sale of plant is concerned we have in this -- in our industry we have the unique advantage of being able to do both capability to execute both and ensure that both of them actually enhance our returns. So from that perspective that optionality is something that I certainly want to keep. And I want to make sure that we work our way through the quality of the projects, the risks associated with that before we make that final call. Our customers and developers recognize that and actually appreciate the fact that we have that flexibility to offer as well. So, I'm not going to give you a kind of percentage in terms of what you see out of sale of gas versus plant. It is fair to say as a principal though that principally we like sale of gas as a base model and it's where we find that the risks are probably a little bit different to what we would expect. That's where we would opt out then for the sale of plant model. Largely on size of projects I say to you as you look at this number of $30-plus billion that we're talking about you're going to see projects probably 20 to 25 large projects happen to make up that number. That kind of gives you a bit of an average view. There is no particular size that I can attribute to these projects they range depending on the scope of the project itself. 
Duffy Fischer: Terrific, thank you guys.
Operator: We will now take your next question from Steven Richardson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. 
Steven Richardson: Hi, good morning. I appreciate the comments on limiting your expertise to industrial gas and limiting some of the exposure in the subsurface. A couple of questions on that. Where would your scope of CapEx end in these projects Sanjiv in terms of how you're thinking about them in a greater blue kind of hydrogen setup? And then also do you think that that subsea partner needs to be part of the project consortium, or is this something you think you can secure for a fee? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Steve. So let me talk about the scope first. So typically carbon capture is absolutely within our scope in almost every instance. That is capability that we bring. There is proprietary technology that we are pushing hard at the moment. We think we've got some world-leading technology that we call HISOP, PSAs [ph]. These are CO2 PSAs that absorb that CO2 capture rate and allow us to then take it forward for storage and sequestration.  So quite excited and that's the part of the technology that we want to make sure will always be within our scope. Beyond that ensuring that you pressurize and transport that CO2 is something that we also would like to do typically, but are more flexible on. It's part of the scope that we would obviously give to our partner would be all around that CO2 going downhole and what happens to that CO2 beyond that including monitoring longer term etcetera.  As far as the approach to subsurface partnerships are concerned there are various models Steve that we would follow. There's a whole range from consortium approach that we've been working on already and hopefully we'll announce in the near term to having them as being partners joint venture partners within the project itself. So that whole range is available to us. We find that depending on the market and the actual project scope that kind of best defines where that partnership is then put together. 
Steven Richardson: That's great. And if I can have a quick follow-up just on how you're thinking about the decarbonized customers. Again we appreciate all the detail here. But if we think about on-site in the Americas for example in hydrogen, is it right to think that you've got a natural jump-off point at the end of contracts where you can start opening the conversation about okay can we convert this to a blue hydrogen project and what that looks like?  Or is the incentive now so high that the customers are coming to you saying, can we work together on some interim solution? Just curious what the contract tenor if anything could mean for the timing of this build-out. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Steve it's definitely the latter where a number of customers are very actively engaged in conversations with us. What tends to happen is you have to think about this as an incremental service offer if you like on an existing asset. When we talk about Decarbonize Linde as an example that's where we would capture CO2 of our existing facilities and transform that gray hydrogen of today into blue hydrogen that goes into the network and feeds existing customers. So that's kind of one way to think about it. And that's where we're seeing a number of customers quite interested given the strength of our network and the asset footprint that we have in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to that, there will be conversations for sure that happen it just depends on the timing of the contracts in many cases. The underlying takeaway from this that I want you to kind of keep in mind is there is urgency in the customer base to want to progress given that both 45Q and 45V in many ways is actually pushing them to try and monetize the benefit that comes out of this decarbonization kind of effort that IRA is supporting.
Steven Richardson: Thanks so much.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I recall Sanjiv, you making some comments during the summer about what at least I perceived you had as kind of a longer-term estimate of the production costs for gray, blue and green hydrogen. And I recall it being gray $1 a kilogram, $1.50 for blue, $4.50 for green. Perhaps I didn't hear that correctly but that was all pre-IRA. And I would suspect your Niagara Falls project might actually have cost structure below that $4.50. So, post-IRA these three, look like they're getting pretty close. Would you share that view? And where do you see the most incremental demand in development right now? Is it -- the blue seems like a bit of a lay-up for your pipeline customers, but where do you see the demand for green coming from?
Sanjiv Lamba: Right. Steve, you've got good memory or good, as the case might be. So it was 1.30 for gray, 1.50 for blue and about 4.40 for green that I offered I think a couple of quarters ago. And that was all at I think natural gas price if I'm not wrong of around 350. Obviously natural gas prices change along the way as well. But the moot point over here that you make and I will validate for you is gray and blue are coming close to parity today with the benefit of the 45Q in place. They are almost at parity, I would say. As far as green is concerned with the 45V the $3 a kg is pretty attractive. The issue with green remains scalability and I'll talk a bit more about blue and green in that context. But from a cost point of view that 440 is now trending anywhere between, 250 to three. So it has come down substantially, but again, because of lack of scale and the availability of cheap renewable energy that pricing for green remains a little bit higher than what I would see as long-term inflection point which you've heard me talk about 150 as a long-term inflection point for us to see huge acceleration happen. Not quite there, but certainly heading in the right direction as far as we concern. Coming on to where I see this development moving and really I think for me blue today is available at scale. It's technology that's tested. And it's an offering that's available in the market today which is why a lot of the conversations I referenced in my previous answer are being driven, because that ability is available today. The challenge with green remains the ability to scale-up and get access to reliable renewable energy at reasonable costs. That combination isn't quite here. And while the 45V has some really good incentive at its max $3 per kg of green hydrogen unfortunately the impediment really is around scale-up to getting that to a point of inflection and significant acceleration. So you summarize that, I expect a decade plus of blue as a great bridge to ultimately large-scale industrial scale green which is reliably available at cost where that conversion makes a lot of sense.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Mike Leithead: Great. Thanks. Just three quick ones for Matt, I think you made a comment about recapitalizing the balance sheet. And since EBITDA is growing I'm assuming that should mean buybacks should be growing faster from here. I guess one is that correct? Two what's the ideal leverage ratio? Obviously, with staying within your, kind of, credit parameters you'd like to be at? And maybe three just a quick housekeeping. Do you include buyback benefits in your 4Q guidance, or is that just using a third quarter share count? 
Matt White: Hi, Mike. So taking them in order. Yes, you are correct recapitalize the balance sheet essentially means, essentially reduce our equity through buybacks and that could imply the debt building up. So that is absolutely correct. As far as the ideal leverage ratio again you are correct the single A under the S&P scale and A2 under Moody's is what we are aiming for. And as you know they do have their own proprietary metrics, which rely on certain adjustments for things like capitalized leases and pensions. But when looking at what I call the simplified metric that we use which today we're showing at 1.1 times on debt to EBITDA, I think, you can get that in the mid-twos or higher as options and we've seen that in the past. Clearly you'd have to work with the rating agencies to ensure your rate -- your ratings are still aligned. But I think that is definitely a feasible area. And then as far as guidance yes generally when we look at that we, sort of, take that on kind of our share count. There might be a little bit of benefit of some of the buyback. But realize as you know probably the buyback the way it affects into the EPS it's, sort of, a cumulative effect. So what you're doing in any given quarter tends to have more of a lag effect anyways. So it would more be a function of what we've done to now, and maybe a little bit of what we do in the fourth quarter. And then what we do in the fourth quarter will have a bigger impact in Q1 and going forward. So there will be a little bit in there but it will be more a function of what we completed here in the third quarter. 
Mike Leithead: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Nicola Tang. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Nicola Tang: Just ask a little bit about the buy -- sorry the start-up contribution into 2023. Could you confirm that Exxon is still on track for next year? And I think you talked about a 1% sort of volume impact in Q3. Can you give us a share on what we should expect for next year? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Nicola I didn't get the question entirely, but I heard Exxon and sale of gas for next year. And I want to just confirm to you that that project is progressing on track and we expect to have that from a commercial structure in place for next year and you'll see that reflected next year as well. I didn't get the second part of your question Nicola. 
Nicola Tang: I was just asking for the overall project start-up contribution in 2023. 
Sanjiv Lamba: Right. We expect to see a similar start-up contribution, obviously, upped by what we see from an Exxon perspective, which is a single large project that you would see. But you should expect -- excluding that we should expect the same level of start-ups next year as this year, which we said earlier on was about $1 billion of start-ups in the course of this year. 
Nicola Tang: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In the third quarter sequentially did -- your price versus raw materials did that margin widen out, or did it shrink? And can you speak to the effect of higher interest rates on Linde and its interest expense for its returns over time? 
Sanjiv Lamba: Jeff, I'll take the first question and ask Matt to talk you through what we're seeing on the interest side of things.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thank you. 
Sanjiv Lamba: So the way to, kind of, best describe it is you will see sequentially our margins in the Americas improved. APAC was stable and slightly up. And we did have a slag in the EMEA region which obviously you've seen as well. We put a table on the EMEA slide just to explain that. So, yes, as far as sequentially, our recovery was more than offsetting inflation and Americas and APAC were able to reflect that. We're seeing some record pricing there. In EMEA we had record pricing of 14%. This obviously excludes any pass-through 14%. But despite that there is a lag. We were seeing electricity price increases in EMEA and Germany and UK in 80s and 60%. And that lag will be there for a month or so, as you've seen from previous quarters. And I fully expect the team in EMEA is very conscious of that and working through both pricing and cost actions to make sure we have a recovery as we move forward.
Matt White: And Jeff, this is Matt. So on the interest expense, maybe I can provide a high-level answer and then get to your specific question. So when thinking about I'd say modeling interest expense, there's really two components to think about. One is going to be essentially what you're referring to which is our current debt structure -- net debt structure. So the cash the debt, whether it's variable or fixed and then the interest effect on that both as interest income and interest outflow. But secondly, we do have some FX volatility that always occurs in our interest line. Some is related to the derivatives we have on intercompany loans, this would be the points that you may have that move up and down based on currencies. But the bigger volatility will actually be unhedged intercompany loans, where they get marked to market to the interest line based on whatever the prevailing interest rates are. So they do tend to create volatility on the interest line the unhedged loans. They actually have no effect on cash because they're intercompany. So when you exclude that I would say our run rate interest number is somewhere in the sort of low-20s to mid-20s right now. And what we have is when you think about our capital structure right now our cash which is earning deposit interest is somewhat close to our variable debt which right now is mostly commercial paper. The rest of our debt is fixed. It's bonds. So what I would anticipate right now is you wouldn't see much of a material change in that until the next bond issuance. And at that point obviously when you do that new bond issuance, you will have a yield in what the prevailing markets are and then that will be layered in. And you essentially will then have certain maturing bonds that might be at lower interest rates. So from my perspective what you're seeing today is mostly volatility of FX rates. And then as we go to the bond market in the future at least based on the prevailing rates, I would expect to see net interest start to rise.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: We will now take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Back to Slide 4. Sanjiv, how should we think about the returns on these projects? And how is the competition shaping up for these projects? Is it more or less intense on your traditional projects? My first question can we return actually above your normalized rate given the uniqueness of these projects?
Sanjiv Lamba: David, as far as we are concerned, these projects have to meet the same investment criteria that we set out. So when we say that we want -- we expect returns to be commensurate with risk there is no free pass for clean energy projects. They have to provide the same return profile that we see vis-a-vis the risk that we're taking on board. So you can rest assure that our return profiles will reflect that on an ongoing basis as well. As far as competition is concerned, I think competition is a little bit varied in this space. As you'll appreciate, we have a range of players who all have a role to play. We are seeing partnerships shape up as maybe a critical part of the offering that comes to market as far as decarbonization is concerned. And we believe strongly that I think good partnerships make a lot of sense for us as well both in managing our risk profiles subsurface is a good example of that, but also alongside that ensuring that we've got people with skin in the game particularly sometimes bringing an offtaker in as a partner to make sure they've got skin in the game and that offtake piece really has some teeth as we move forward. So a range of -- there's no -- it's an evolving market space and we watch it to see how that competition piece evolves. But at the moment that's kind of what we're seeing.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on Europe on your take or pay contracts, are you seeing any issues with any contracts given the current elevated energy price environment?
Sanjiv Lamba: Simple answer to that is no. We have strong takeaway contracts. There are some customers who are below take-or-pay at the moment in Europe, but those contracts are being enforced and payments are happening.
David Begleiter: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Matt, just wanted to circle back on the balance sheet question and get a mark-to-market from you on where you think Linde can borrow at these days and then how that feeds into. As you're discussing new projects how are you baking in higher financing costs in terms of project returns and the like?
Matt White: Sure, Vince. I think with the projects to me we don't take the current prevailing rates and bake it into that perspective. And the reason is, as you know we're making 15-20-year investments. And embedded with that we already incorporate inflation recovery on the facility fees. So when you tend to see elevated rates, that does come back through the inflation adjustment mechanisms as it is anyways. And we don't need to debt finance these projects as we build them. As you know, they take several years to build anyways. So from that perspective, we've been through many decades as you well know, on interest rate cycles and our long-term model continues to be quite resilient with the contractual inflation recovery that enables to incorporate that. As far as borrowing rates, I mean we – yes, we're a single A but lately we've been tended to be more AA or better on the spreads. When we decide to go to the market, I would expect our spreads should be some of the better ones you would see. But of course it's from a benchmark that's higher today. So you can take the benchmark today, and just take some of the spreads you've seen demonstrated at kind of our rating [ph] or better and that's sort of what we would borrow at. But at this point, I feel pretty good about our access to capital and still get some of the lowest cost capital around. 
Vincent Andrews: Okay. Good to hear. Thanks so much.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Dan Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my questions You talked a bit about the return on capital for the -- for investments. I was just wondering, with the new opportunities in gray, green and blue hydrogen, at this point if we should assume the return on capital is below the traditional products, but should exceed it within, I don't know the next five to 10 years? Or how we should think about the return on capital, on these new opportunities? 
Sanjiv Lamba: So, in terms of return on capital let me go back to the question that I responded to earlier by saying that, the investment criteria that we set out for our projects, double-digit unlevered returns is what we would look at obviously, commensurate with the risk that we take on. That is what is reflected in the projects that we currently look at and approve. And that is reflected therefore, in the return on capital that you see within our business today. I expect these projects to continue to support that return on capital elements, and our investor -- our investment criteria has not changed for projects in the clean energy space, whether it's blue or green. Obviously, there is some support available through the IRA that holds, that return or supports that return profile as well and of course, accelerates decision-making from our customer's point of view. 
A - Matt White: And maybe I could just add one more point, Dan. When we make our decisions, we make it on an essentially cash basis an IRR unlevered after-tax cash basis. So, that won't change. As you know, the ROC is more of an accounting metric. So, I wouldn't look at that 21.8% in a benchmark in any way or in any form. I mean obviously, we're getting benefits there from the noncapital portion of our business today, which we expect to continue going forward. But when we make project decisions as Sanjiv mentioned, it's more on an IRR basis on how we think about that. 
Dan Rizzo: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Geoff Haire from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Geoff Haire: Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I'm going to fly the flight for Europe slightly. With a lot of talk about the Inflation Reduction Act in the US, how does that influence politicians' thinking in Europe, from what you understand in terms of changing the way investments are done for low carbon hydrogen in Europe? 
Sanjiv Lamba: That's a great question, Geoff. It's topical as well because I had -- over the last couple of days I've had a number of conversations, with political leadership in different parts of Europe. Two things. First, the IRA I think came as a surprise to many people including many of the political leadership in Europe, and they have recognized that it has a galvanizing effect in terms of moving the pace at which change happens on clean energy in the US and obviously, are envious of that change given that European Commission requires time and a fair amount of work to kind of be able to get to its point of decision-making. The other piece, I think is that that awareness has then led them to recognize that some urgent actions are needed. I'll give you two quick examples of conversations. I may not quote them in detail, but I'll let you know that the fact that Europe was all about green hydrogen only, clearly has changed and there is a greater acceptance of the fact that blue provides a very effective bridge to getting to clean energy in due course. Today Europe just needs energy. They are burning more coal than they had planned for as you know. So really that pragmatism, which was lacking in the past on making sure that low carbon intensity hydrogen was welcomed into Europe on par. There was no discrimination against blue versus green, et cetera. I think that's a change that I think is fundamental and we'll see some of that. And the fact that Europe also recognized that while they can talk about developing projects in Europe, they desperately need to ensure that they have processes in place to import significant amounts of clean energy and in this case blue, green hydrogen, ammonia, et cetera into Europe to be able to leverage and build infrastructure needed is the other change that I'm expecting to see in the near term. So I'd say the IRA has provided some real soul searching opportunity for Europe and they are going to do something about it. 
Geoff Haire: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from John Roberts. Your line is open. please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. If you add sequestration to hydrogen for an existing refinery customer, do you expect that existing refinery customer to pay a premium for blue hydrogen, where you just expect to get the credits to cover the cost of adding sequestration? And how do the existing contracts anticipate this? I'm just trying to understand from the customer's perspective how this is going to work?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, when we look at customers and discussions that we're having, the customers are themselves trying to leverage that blue hydrogen into their own product slate in some cases moving towards more renewable fuels, which then attract significant and attractive further benefits that come out of places like California as an example. So moving to renewable fuels accessing California's low-carbon standard framework and accessing further incentives allows them to consider premiums that would become available on -- and pay for on the blue hydrogen as well. But in truth, I'd say to you that if I look at broad-based adoption of blue hydrogen, the IRA provides through the 45Q credit a significant benefit in terms of accelerating that decision and does come from a point of return perspective does support the return to moving to blue hydrogen even with marginal premiums on it.
John Roberts: Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go head.
Cory Murphy: Good morning. This is Cory Murphy on for Kevin. In your packaged gases business can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of demand for hardgoods as opposed to gas and rent? I recall the hardgoods tend to be a leading indicator, so curious if you're seeing any trends in the business that would portend slower macro growth ahead? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks. So hardgoods business both on the package side, I'd say to you both gases and hardgoods business are both growing double digits as things stand. On the hardgoods side, we look at two different aspects of it, when you talk about kind of leading indicators to what we're seeing around economic activity, we see both on equipment sales as well as consumable sales. I can tell you I see demand and growth on the equipment side as well would suggest that people are still putting some cash on the ground to make sure that they are able to catch up with many of the supply chain issues that have plagued manufacturing more broadly. So I still -- at this point in time still feel pretty good about where we are seeing hardgoods development as things stand. And I'm talking about the US here. 
Cory Murphy: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our next question from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Mike Sison : Hi, guys. Nice quarter. Just curious I'm sort of impressed that your volumes remained positive given recessionary conditions or no growth. If demand firmly goes negative in 2023, what do you think your volume outlook would sort of unfold in that scenario?
Sanjiv Lamba: Hey Mike, I'd love to speculate but I'm not going to do that. We'll come back to you in the next quarter you know and we'll give you a full outlook for 2023. We're going to go through our own very detailed planning exercise. I'll have the guys in here from all over the world over a three-day period where we'll run through each one of their planning processes. A lot of these assumptions will get tested and challenged in the course of that. But again, I just want to -- I think the point that you make is that resilience stands out Mike and sometimes people take that for granted. But in our case, we recognize and our volumes showing through is just another element of that resilience in addition to the fact that I explained at the last earnings call, our defensive business model, including the contractual structure that we have, even when volumes are down we're able to actually preserve much of our profit and our top line as well. Again, just a recognition of that is quite important in these times particularly. But we'll give you more in the next quarter for sure.
Mike Sison: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will now take our final question from Mike Harrison from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Mike Harrison: Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. First of all, in Europe, any thoughts on the recent decline in natural gas prices and what that could mean for your costs? Are you going to realize some of that? And then the second question is around electronics. You acknowledged that there has been some negative headlines around semiconductor producers. Curious for some additional color on the near-term and longer-term impacts that might have on your electronics business, if there is some reduction in capital spending from those fabs? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Mike. So, just on natural gas very quickly on EMEA. Obviously, we've seen continued volatility around natural gas pricing. We've been able to push that through our contractual cost pass-through structure. We will continue to do the same. If natural gas prices come down significantly, margins will get enhanced as a consequence. As you know, it's a clear math around how pass-through works, and really no concerns from our perspective. Obviously, lower natural gas pricing will help the broader economy and hopefully some economic tailwind as a result of that which should be positive for us. As far as Electronic segment is concerned, let me kind of break that up into two parts. Let's start with the long-term in terms of investments being made and the CHIPS Act out of the US and a similar act out of Europe pushing to have localized investments in their regions continues to drive fab investments as we move forward. In conversations with some of our largest customers more recently, I have seen commitments from them of staying at the same level, if not increasing their investment levels. Some of them tend to invest countercyclical. That's been a strategy that's worked well for them. And I expect to see those levels remain fairly stable in the mid-term, I'd say. So that's from now until the next four to five years. Of course, we are winning more than our fair share of those and I feel good about the fact that we'll see continued growth as a result of that. In the near term most of our large customers continue to consume, which is what I -- the pointed comment I made earlier on that despite what you read in the press, our consumers continue to consume gases at every fab that we supply. And that's a really good position to be in. There are some concerns around China that I've heard from investors as well. And again, I want to confirm that our volumes in China continue to be unimpacted by current embargoes and so on and so forth that might exist. They might have an effect on longer-term investments in China, but we are yet to kind of see that reflected in the demand pull that we see from the markets.
End of Q&A:
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back to Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Cecilia, thank you. And thank you everyone on the line for participating in today's call. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions. Have a great rest of your day. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-28 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde plc Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations for any additional or closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you, Elaine. Good day, everyone. Thank you for attending our 2022 second quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our Web site at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv will provide the opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's second quarter financial performance and outlook. After which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by addressing the 1 billion charge this quarter, primarily related to deconsolidating our Russian subsidiaries. Impairing assets is not something we take lightly. However, the current situation in Russia is unprecedented with the extraordinary sanctions and capital restrictions.  And while deconsolidation means we will not report Russian results going forward, we are actively working to safely and economically scale back operations. We fully intend to recover value for these assets, including potential divestitures, but it will take some time. Despite this non-cash accounting charge, the global business continues to be resilient and performed quite well in the second quarter with strong pricing, solid cash flows and margins expanding sequentially and year-on-year, excluding cost pass through.  Slide 3 demonstrates the defensive nature of our model. Now it may look familiar since many of these elements were presented in the second quarter of 2020. The world may change, but our business model does not. We've been around for well over 100 years, and through that demonstrated our resiliency during some of the most difficult periods in modern history.  Approximately two thirds of the business is protected through contractual fixed payments, such as facility fees and rent, and sales to resilient end markets like food and beverage, healthcare and electronics. This portfolio provides tremendous downside protection during difficult times, like the early 2000 recession, the great financial crisis, the 2020 pandemic, and of course now in 2022.  In addition, strong cash generation coupled with relentless price and cost management support the business when volumes contract. And, of course, we can benefit from a recovery as demonstrated after each recession. These facts apply to all geographic segments, including EMEA, where there appears to be some potential investor misconceptions around our business.  So you can see on the bottom right, our exposure to EMEA and some additional color, specifically to Germany. We run our business in Europe like anywhere else in the world, safely, reliably, and in a matter contractually limit our financial exposure to customer volatility. Now I'm not going to speculate what will happen in Europe regarding the energy situation. But I have confidence in our business model and contracts that we can weather challenges, and we will capitalize on opportunities that may lie ahead.  Now before I hand it off to Matt, I'd like to provide some color on end markets by segment. Slide 4 shows our organic growth is still quite positive across all end markets with the exception of healthcare, which is due to lapping COVID-related oxygen volumes in developing nations. Overall growth is driven by pricing action, project backlog, even as base volumes are relatively stable although underlying trends by geographic segments vary a little.  Let me start off with the EMEA region since it seems to be getting most press recently. Volumes were down 1% from last year and flat sequentially, while price increased 12% and 3%, respectively. The team has done a great job pricing inflation, while keeping a tight lid on costs and I fully expect this to continue.  On-site volumes have been quite stable from a combination of highly competitive top tier customer base and strong contracts. Merchant and package are slightly down as a reduction in COVID oxygen and low manufacturing volumes more than offset growth in food and beverage, metals and mining and electronics.  So far in July, we haven't seen any material change from June trends, despite certain countries navigating their energy challenges. You will recall in the second quarter of 2020, Eurozone industrial production levels dropped roughly 20% due to COVID lockdowns.  At that time, our EMEA segment organically declined only 7%. And since that time, the EMEA segment operating profit has grown approximately 80%. In other words, the EMEA business has successfully navigated unprecedented economic shocks in the past. And I see no reason why that won't continue going forward. The APAC segment had another solid quarter, despite COVID lockdowns in China. Volumes increased 3% from prior year and 5% sequentially, while prices improved 5% and 1%. On-site customers across all end markets continue to run steady, including China. We saw similar trends in past recessions, which speak to the quality of our customer base.  Now China merchant was weaker from the production curtailment of small to medium-sized customers, which was partially offset by merchant growth in other countries, as well as higher package gas volumes, especially our specialty gases used in electronics such as helium, neon and xenon. In July, China merchant volumes have recovered to levels more consistent with normal run rates as we've been seeing, but we haven't been seeing material COVID impact at this time. I do expect some volume ups and downs in the second half, but that should smooth out by the end here.  Aside from China, organic growth across Korea, South Pacific, South and Southeast Asia remain healthy from a combination of project startups, pricing actions, and of course our capability to supply gases across all three supply modes.  Our largest segment, the Americas, had some of the best growth trends and opportunities for the near term. Organic growth of 9% from last year includes 3% volume and 6% price. All major end markets have expanded, led by food and beverage, electronics, manufacturing, chemicals and energy, excluding Latin America and healthcare trends related to COVID.  In the U.S., our integrated model across all three supply modes enables reliable and seamless gas supply for all customers, regardless of size or end market. In fact, our U.S. packaged gas business has been one of our fastest growing businesses, with underlying sales up 16% from prior year led by aerospace, construction, electronics and met fab. The underlying trend appears stable in July, although we expect some normal seasonal slowing for the summer holidays.  Also, we continue to see more project backlog opportunities in the U.S. than anywhere else. Recent wins for electronics have been the largest driver, but progress on potential new U.S. Gulf Coast projects, especially for blue hydrogen, are encouraging. And as I look at our overall current sale of gas backlog report, there are several projects we expect to sign before the year end, which could take this number close to the 4 billion mark, even after starting up close to 1 billion in projects during the course of the year.  Now I'd also like to highlight that we recently issued our Annual Sustainability Report, which provides a comprehensive view of our SDG-based initiatives and tracks our progress. I'm pleased to see that in this quarter, we reported a reduction of 31% on our GHG emissions versus the 2018 baseline, well ahead of our projections to reach our target of 35% reduction by 2028.  But we realized that an intensity goal was not enough. And therefore last year, we communicated our ambitious 35 by 35 goal. As you know, we're committed in reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions 35% by the year 2035, on the way to becoming climate neutral by 2050. As you'd expect, our 35 by 35 target is science-based and aligned with the Paris accord goal.  Overall, our technical capability, unrivaled network density, disciplined operating culture, and a committed team allows us to quickly capitalize on any growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria. Now some investors mistakenly look at one or two countries in our portfolio and come to conclusions about growth prospects of profitability.  But what they miss is our ability to capture that growth anywhere in the world while simultaneously right-sizing the businesses in an efficient manner. This ability has enabled us to consistently deliver double-digit EPS growth, and this year is no different. The Linde model is well suited for a fast changing world, and our performance will continue to demonstrate its resilience.  I'll now turn the call over to Matt to walk through the financial numbers.
Matthew White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Before I jump into the numbers, I'd like to explain the Russian deconsolidation in a little more detail. Over $900 million of the charge relates to net Russian asset impairments. Note these assets have increased almost 25% in the last few months due to the strengthening of the Russian ruble.  There were several factors that led to this outcome, including the unprecedented sanctions and severe capital restrictions. Deconsolidation essentially means we cease reporting any business activity on our financial statements. However, we still own these assets and will continue to scale back operations while working to divest some industrial assets. We will only recognize cash that can be repatriated from Russia into a consolidated Linde entity. And as Sanjiv stated, we are laser focused to continuously extract economic value consistent with every other business we own. Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the second quarter results. Sales of $8.5 billion increased 12% from prior year and 3% sequentially. Versus prior year, contractual cost-pass through increased 7%, primarily from the on-site business but this was partially offset by a currency translation decline of 5%. Foreign currency is anticipated to remain a significant headwind, which I'll speak to later on the guidance slide.  Organic sales increased 9% from last year and 4% sequentially. Gas volumes increased 2%, primarily from project startups. Base volumes were relatively flat, as increases in manufacturing, food and beverage and electronics were mostly offset by lower healthcare volumes from COVID.  Pricing of 7% was broad based, and once again demonstrated our ability to price in extraordinary inflation environments. Recall this figure primarily represents merchant and packaged, so underlying price increases are higher. Operating profit of $2 billion resulted in a 23.5% margin.  Excluding the effects of contractual cost-pass through, operating margins expanded 100 basis points from prior year and 80 basis points over the first quarter. This represents the second quarter in a row that operating margins have sequentially improved, which confirms the one to two quarter recovery lag we discussed late last year.  You can see the table showing operating margin trend by segment, excluding the effects of cost-pass through. It's important to highlight that America segment margin declined more than 100 basis points from one-time charges incurred during the second quarter, which are classified as other expenses. This will not repeat. So I fully expect America's margins to return to the normal run rate in the third quarter.  Separately, APAC and EMEA continue to show solid margin expansion versus all periods as price and cost management continue to improve business quality. You'll see in the appendix how global other segment had positive operating income. As mentioned last quarter, Q1 had one-time charges which we lacked.  And now you're seeing the benefit of lower corporate costs coupled with higher volumes to the aerospace market in the coatings business. Note we are in the process of divesting the non-core GIST business which will result in lower sales and operating profit for this segment going forward.  EPS of $3.10 increased 15% from last year, or 20%, excluding FX. Despite the various geopolitical headwinds, the business continues to generate EPS well in excess of our midterm commitment. Return on capital reached 20%, almost doubling from the 2018 merger baseline level. This was accomplished from double-digit earnings growth, strong cash generation and disciplined capital deployment, all during a highly volatile economic environment.  Slide 6 provides more details on our capital management. Available operating cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less base CapEx that is used for maintenance or non-contractual committed growth, has held steady during 2022 at $1.5 billion per quarter.  During the second quarter alone, we deployed $3 billion of capital with approximately one quarter invested into the business and the remainder distributed back to shareholders as dividends and repurchases. This approach is only possible with steady and reliable cash flow, a highly valuable trait to have these days.  I'll wrap up with an updated outlook on Slide 7. Third quarter guidance range of $2.85 to $2.95 represents year-over-year growth of 4% to 8% or 10% to 14% when excluding an estimated 6% FX headwind. The FX assumption was based on spot rates from a few weeks ago. So it reflects some of the recent devaluations.  This sequential EPS decline of $0.15 from Q2 to the top end of the Q3 range is driven by $0.10 of FX and $0.05 from the deconsolidation of Russia. Therefore, this range assumes no base growth at the top end with recessionary conditions below that.  Consistent with prior guidance, this is not our prediction of the economy, but rather an assumption used in the figures. You can insert your own view of the economy. If it does better, we'll be above this range. And if it does worse, we'll take mitigating actions.  Full year EPS guidance range of $11.73 to $11.93 is 10% to 12% above prior year, or 15% to 17% when excluding the negative 5% currency impact. This range was increased from last quarter since improved business performance more than offset the larger FX translation headwind. Irrespective of the geopolitical landscape, we will relentlessly take actions to improve the business and outperform expectations.  As Sanjiv stated, we've been doing this for over a century. Consistent with prior crises, I fully expect to not only overcome these challenges, but emerge even stronger than before. And while the financial markets may temporarily underprice our stock from misperceptions of the business model, we'll continue to pursue quality growth while deploying excess cash towards stock repurchases, all in an effort to reward long-term shareholders.  I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Duffy Fischer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. First question is just around the price versus cost. When you look out over the next one to two quarters, how much visibility do you have on your non-pass through cost? And the price that you've already taken is that enough that we should continue to see a positive spread on price versus cost sequentially over those next two quarters?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Duffy. So let me just go back and maybe reiterate how we think about staying ahead of that cost inflation and how are we managing our pricing over the last many quarters? Essentially, you think about pricing in our industry and for us in three key buckets. You've got the energy bucket. You've got the fuels bucket. As you know, we travel a lot of kilometers delivering products. And then we've got essentially the wages bucket which we managed quite actively. Through the last four quarters and of course if you go back into history over the last 20 years, we've demonstrated positive pricing over that period. The last four quarters have shown we've been able to keep ahead of cost inflation. We've talked about a lag of one to two quarters. That's kind of the visibility we had. We continue to have the same visibility. And in fact as you see margins over the last two quarters expand, you know that that lag of one to two quarters is being fully covered and reflecting into margin expansion that we've been able to show across all the segments. We do actively manage that spread, Duffy to your point, on how we look at pricing versus inflation. And that's something that we have good visibility on within the organization. And we pursue quite actively with our monthly reviews, et cetera, that you're aware of.
Duffy Fischer: Fair enough. Thank you. And then just to dig in on Europe a little bit, if energy prices stay high, what percent of your customers do you think have a long-term issue? And so it may be that you're made whole on your take or pay contract, but it may be that that customer just isn't viable? Do you have kind of a walking around number in your head? Is it 5%, 10%, 15%? What percent of customers would struggle to remain in business if, let's say, $25 in MMBtu natural gas or higher?
Sanjiv Lamba: So Duffy, maybe why don't I just take a step back and just talk about what we saw in the markets in Q2, because that's a good starting point. As you know, energy prices have been higher for a while. This is not -- this hasn't certainly peaked only in this year. In fact, it started last year well before the war itself. And when I look at the end markets across EMEA, I see sales growing across all end markets, expecting healthcare which we talked about and are lapping the COVID volumes, particularly in Eastern Europe and Middle East. If I think about our distribution modes, that's the other way to look at the profile of the customers. Across all distribution modes, we saw sales grow as well; on-site, merchant and package, obviously held by strong pricing, the pass through that you just referenced, but also we saw volumes at healthcare continue to stay stable or move forward. So when I think about the outlook, my view is at this point in time, there isn't anything in the trend that we look at, which is suggesting that people are fundamentally changing how they operate or are kind of not managing the challenges. Yes, a lot of them are looking at how to save costs clearly. I'll give you a good example of where we are working very closely with them to get that done. But also we are understanding that people are actively looking at their own pricing measures and we're seeing that across most of the industries we serve. I'll give you a quick example of how cost savings programs are running. So clearly with natural gas costs being where they are, people are now starting to look at industrial gases to help them become more efficient, increase throughput as well while they do that. A good example of that is our oxyfuel offer that we have. And recently, obviously, given where energy prices are across the world, but in EMEA in particular, we've had a lot of traction with customers in the course of the first half of this year, helping them improve their processes by injecting oxygen and substituting in part air, but also reducing their natural gas consumption as a consequence. 10 wins already in the first half. We've got at least 15 to 20 other proposals that we're working on. That's a good example of where we are using industrial gases to help people manage their cost base and address some of the points that you raised.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we move to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Obviously a lot of questions over the last couple of months about what would happen if there's a gas supply issue in Europe. Maybe you just want to give us the sort of the state-of-the-art on how your take or pay contracts work? And maybe in particular, how they would work in a situation if you are yourself unable to get electricity and operate your facilities?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Vincent. So I'm going to use Germany as an example, because it's kind of -- that's where everyone's attention seems to be at the moment. And we tried to address this issue when we showed you the defensiveness of our business, right, and we showed you Germany on Slide 3 and the exposure we have over there. So using Germany as an example, I'll remind you Germany's about 5% of our company sales. We said that two thirds of the German sales at the moment are what we would call defensive, and we talk about those being underpinned by contracts or supplying to resilient markets. When I talk about underpinned by contracts, we've got six facility fee or rentals in place over there. The two thirds of the business is protected through that. If you now look at what's left [ph], that's about 1% to 1.5% of our overall sales. So I just want to kind of make sure that the magnitude of the volatility that we're talking about is actually limited from our perspective in the example of Germany to about 1% to 1.5% of our overall Linde revenues. Coming to the contract structures themselves, our contracts basically have two components within them, a fixed fee that allows us to recover on the capital and the operations that we do and then a pass through element that essentially passes through the feedstock that we use, in this case, natural gas. We are very confident on both the quality of customers we serve, because that is quite important in times like this, but equally on the quality of the contracts and our enforceability of those contracts and those fixed fees that we have within the contract that protect us.
Vincent Andrews: What about in the event that you would not be able to operate your facility? How would your contracts work?
Sanjiv Lamba: Actually, yes, I should cover that part. So you're essentially talking about our atmospheric business now if you talked about electricity earlier on, right? And I just want to make the point. Obviously, we are in very intense conversations with the German government around electricity and how the energy kind of allocations will happen. Just as a quick reminder, in all our countries, including Germany, we are one of the key players producing medical gases and safety critical process gases. For instance, even if you turn down operations, you need nitrogen as part of that. Even if you shut down operations, you need nitrogen for safety purposes. Because we produce gases, which are critical, either from medical or a process safety perspective, the German government, to illustrated one but others as well, allocate us on a preferential or priority basis and therefore, the unlikely event of us not being able to operate, Vincent, is really very, very miniscule. So that is kind of, from our perspective, what provides the confidence that we have with those operations will continue to be operating.
Matthew White: And, Vince, this is Matt. I would just add one more thing to that. This is why density is so critical in this industry, because the density helps bring tremendous reliability in events like this. So to your question, we have the ability to run other assets. Now, of course, you'd have higher distribution and you would have higher distribution costs, which would need to be recovered via either surcharging mechanisms. But that option also presents itself that when you have a large density platform, you can leverage other areas that you can still bring those critical gases. Now, clearly, it will be at a distribution penalty, which you need to recovery, but you still have the reliability to ensure that supply. So that is another element why we view this density of our models so critical to enable times like these.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much for all the detail, guys. It was really helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Nicola Tang from BNP Paribas Exane has our next question. Please go ahead.
Nicola Tang: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Actually, the first question was a bit of a follow up on the European situation, not specifically about the sort of shorter term trends but just thinking longer term. Are you or would you expect to see any of your customers rethink or -- no, sorry, potential customers rethink whether to make investment decisions in Europe, given the high/volatile energy cost environment?
Sanjiv Lamba: Nicola, I guess our customers are looking at that investment criteria and looking at their risks. And we would expect that customers will constantly look at that and look at diversifying their risk profile. I wouldn't say to you right now that our customers would stop investing in Europe. Absolutely not, but I think they would want to understand the risks as they go about looking at those investments. What you will obviously also see is as the European transition around energy picks up momentum, you will see more people then use that as a basis to try and understand how they can benefit from that and minimize the risk around their investments. But if I'm kind of giving you a straight answer to what I'm seeing today, I'm not seeing a conversation on that which suggests that customers are walking away from investments in Europe.
Nicola Tang: All right, great. That's clear. And the second question, I think Sanjiv in your comments you mentioned sort of that there was rightsizing, which I think you've talked about in the past. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about, I guess, measures that you're trying to put in place at the moment to rightsize, and in particular maybe you could comment on, I think there was a recent Reuters article talking about headcount reduction in the engineering business?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Nicola. So let's just talk about engineering. I'm spending a lot of personal time over there with the team. So I want to just kind of maybe walk you through three steps around engineering, so it kind of illustrates where we are. Step one, you know that we went out last quarter and said to you guys that we would wind down our projects over there in compliance with sanctions and beyond. We've completed that process and the team has obviously gone through that. Now last quarter, we also told you that there was a very dramatic drop in the backlog for that business. And clearly any business that goes through that kind of a change needs to ensure that they reset their cost base, in this case that significant reduction in backlog means that the engineering team is putting together their plans for resetting their cost base to remain competitive and to achieve the target margins that we've set for them, which are low to mid double digit margins, expected longer term. So they are in the process of doing that. And we have a plan that in the course of months now on restructuring that organization will be in play. Now, I do want to add, though, if I may, because we're on engineering, just to say, I was really pleased that in the last quarter, we saw order intake very encouraging at about $1 billion. So it was good to see that while we are managing our cost base actively, rightsizing that organization, and ensuring we remain competitive longer term, we're also in the short-term rebuilding that backlog with high quality projects. And again, seeing the team kind of work on both of those fronts is how Linde typically wants to see their businesses operate. 
Nicola Tang: And is there anything to do in terms of rightsizing in other parts of your business? 
Sanjiv Lamba: We are constantly rightsizing. We've said this before, Nicola, you might recall my comments in previous quarters, where I've said that one of the things we do actively is constantly benchmark within segments and across segments. And one of the reasons we benchmark is because we want to understand where are the best practices and where are the best ratios in terms of the individual productivity that we get for sales per employee, operating profit per employee, et cetera, and we try and apply those. So we are actively doing processes across all our businesses. And there are programs in place at the moment in APAC. You're aware of the program in EMEA. We announced that last year when we took a charge that we were going to reduce a significant number of heads in our German business. That's already in progress today. And similarly, across Americas we are undertaking similar benchmarking exercise as well. So for us, that's a constant process. We don't call that a special program. We do that on an ongoing basis.
Nicola Tang: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Mike Leithead from Barclays has our next question. Please go ahead.
Michael Leithead: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question maybe for Matt, just wanted to follow up on the Americas one-time charges in 2Q. I was hoping maybe could you give just a little bit more color on what that was? And secondly, I just wanted to confirm. Those are included in the 910 million of EBITDA in the quarter. So if I hold all else equal, if you get some of that back next quarter, EBIT would theoretically be higher. Is that fair?
Matthew White: Yes, Mike, so first of all on your second question, yes, you're correct. These are included in all the numbers, everything we're showing on the segment, that's included. And maybe a simple way to clarify it a little more that might help, I would reference Slide 20 in the appendix on the investor slides that you have. If you look at Slide 20, what you'll see, and this is on the consolidated level, is something that's called adjusted other income expense. So this is part of our obviously adjusted results that we give you. It's part of our adjusted EPS that we give you. And it represents costs that are other income and other expense. And these are things that generally are not indicative of kind of the current normal operations, but they are part of operating profit. So they can include things like gain and loss on sale of assets. It can include things like above the line kind of tax or legal type items that would have various accruals. And when you look at the history of this number, it is up and down. And this is a normal type of pattern for a large multinational company like us. In fact, if you look at last year, it ranged anywhere from income of 33 million to outflow expense of 7 million in any given quarter. I'd say on an average year, we tend to be net positive, could be 10 million, 20 million, but it is lumpy. So when you look at Q2 of this year, it was a 31 million expense. And the Americas charges we're talking about, which there was a few, in aggregate were actually even greater than that number. But this is one-off. I have absolutely no concerns over the American margin profile. And we fully expect this will bounce back here in Q3 back to the normal run rates.
Sanjiv Lamba: And I guess [indiscernible] that the underlying -- Mike, that the underlying margin for Americas is growing, just in case. I kind of read a couple of reports that seem to confuse that.
Michael Leithead: Yes. Okay. No, that's great. And then secondly, maybe just for Sanjiv, I just kind of want to touch on your electronics outlook. If I look, I think it makes up about 30% of your current backlog, but it's only about 8%-ish of your current business. So you obviously are increasing your spend towards that. So could you maybe just talk about the attractiveness of that end market for Linde over, say, the next few years there?
Sanjiv Lamba: Absolutely. So as you've probably seen over the last few years, Mike, we have grown that business, that position, and we now call it the resilient market, has grown and clearly we are making massive investments having won a significant amount of the new fab investment that is happening. For us the attractiveness lies in three different ways. One, we deal with some of the best quality customers in the industry on that. So some of our largest customers are Samsung, TSMC, Intel, and others, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Micron, et cetera. That's a good mix to have. We have diversified our risk, but with top tier customers over there with great technology. So that helps. We have a very unique offering in the sense that we are able to leverage our engineering crew to be able to create the technology best suited for the new fabs that are coming up. So we believe we have a technology advantage, alongside our operating expertise of working closely with fabs for decades now. We're able to leverage that and we are winning more than our fair share in terms of the new projects that are coming up. So we feel good about the technology offering translating into a competitive advantage visibly available for us. And then the last piece is there is a piece around specialty gases on electronics. Again, we have strong positions over there. In previous calls, we talked about neon, et cetera. Our strong positions and the fact that we are integrated in our supply chains for some of those internally and not having to source a lot of those externally, we are well positioned to be able to use those gases as a growth driver for us in the electronics space as well. So overall, feel pretty good about it, feel that we really are winning more than our fair share here and feel good about where the industry is and the customers we're dealing with.
Michael Leithead: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We move to John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John McNulty: Thanks for taking my question. Sanjiv, maybe you can give us a little bit more color as to what you're seeing in China, just post the lockdowns, if there are any specific end markets that are maybe surprising you to the upside and either that are maybe a little slower to start, maybe a little bit more color there would be helpful?
Sanjiv Lamba: Absolutely, John. So let me just kind of talk about what I'm seeing from a volume perspective, break it down by our distribution modes, because that's probably the best way to address that a little more granular. So let's look at on-site volumes, what we've seen in the second quarter, and then I'll talk a little bit kind of in terms of outlook. On-site volumes have been stable right through the lockdown. It's an important piece to note high quality customers across end markets, good on-site volumes have been held steady. Merchant volumes, obviously, as you'd expect through that period, given that there were restrictions through the lockdown process, including transportation, distribution, et cetera, we saw merchant volumes move down initially. By end June, we were back at pre-lockdown levels as far as merchant volumes are concerned. So we saw that reasonably quick recovery towards the back end of the quarter as well. Now as I look ahead, I expect to see those on-site volumes remain stable. I think if I am thinking about any volatility, my view would be the steel industry is the one area that I'm watching closely. And if I see movement, that's where I expect that we will see some volatility. As far as merchant volumes are concerned, we might see a little bit of ups and downs, a little bit of variability on those volumes on the merchant side. And largely because as you know, you read about in the press, they have four asymptomatic cases and 1 million people get tested or lockdowns might come back in and out. But for most part, my expectation is over the course of the second half, you'll see all of that kind of sorted out and you'll see normal merchant volume growth levels achieved back in China.
John McNulty: Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe a question on APAC pricing, because it's -- you've had a decent trajectory over the last couple of quarters and you're kind of hitting what looks like a stride that's higher than what we've seen before. Is that -- would you characterize that as broad based in terms of the pricing initiatives, or are there a couple of one-offs on the specialty gases or what have you that might be really juicing those numbers? I guess how should we be thinking about that?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, for most part, I'll tell you that that is broad based. Obviously, we have a couple of specialties in there and you know specialties in Asia Pacific around the electronics piece helped that pricing number. But for most part that is broad based across all geographies and across all end markets.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. We move to Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Linde is roughly 1x levered. So if you were, I don't know, 3x levered, you could put another 20 billion of capital to work. Do you have a leverage level goal? I know that you've got some decarbonisation projects that are pending, government subsidies. I don't know how large these are. Where do you think your leverage level is going to go and why you're going to make acquisitions over the next couple of years?
Matthew White: Hi, Jeff. It's Matt. I can handle that one. So just to probably really quickly restate, as you may recall, our capital allocation policy, which I think is probably relevant for those on the call, but it starts with an overriding mandate. And the mandate for us is to grow the dividend every year and maintain a single A rating on basically our credit rating. And then our priority after that is to invest in the business. And that includes acquisitions, that includes projects, that includes investing in base growth. And then whatever is left of that from our cash, we put towards stock repurchases. We follow that through all good times, recession times, irrespective of the macro environment, the resiliency and the defensiveness of our model enables us to continue to follow that. So to your question, the specific answer, it will be what an A rating is. And you're absolutely right. Right now, we're probably maybe 1.1 levered. I think the team did a good job to balance euro-based debt with our euro-based EBITDA. We continue to grow double digit on our EBITDA and our operating income, which is enabling a strong growth and which is continuing to keep that metric suppressed. So we are deploying capital. We are buying back shares. As you probably saw, year-to-date, we're in excess of $3 billion. But by no means are we ever going to be capital constrained on growth. We're going to go into every growth opportunity. I don't care if it's an acquisition, a decap [ph], a project or base project. If it meets our investment criteria, we're doing it. And so there's no saving or waiting. It's just a continual deployment of capital under this model, but the business continues to perform very well. And so it's just an ongoing effort to deploy all this capital we're generating.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. One of the differences between Linde and the other industrial gas companies is that your SG&A expenses don't grow year-over-year and your competitors, some are growing at a low double digit rate, some are growing at a high single digit rate. And I get that currencies are probably depressing SG&A levels. But what's the difference? What is Linde doing or what is Linde doing that's differentiating itself versus the other industrial gas companies competitively?
Sanjiv Lamba: Jeff, I was going to preempt that question and answer already ahead of your asking that. But I'm going to try and attempt to answer that. We had the same conversations last quarter as well. And I'd say to you that our expenses are down. As you can see, there is a FX impact in there. But primarily, there is the action around managing our SG&A actively every month, which is what keeps it there. And the benefit really comes from two key drivers as far as our SG&A numbers are concerned. We have a very active productivity program. And more recently, using our digital tools, we've got a very active automation program. You see the benefits of those two flowing into simpler processes, ensuring that we take heads out where we can and should, and including running productive programs at every level. And I've said this before many times, thousands of projects that look at every line item and each line item gets addressed. And I'll give you a couple of kind of concrete examples just to illustrate that. So we are running a productivity program at the moment looking at our cost -- our total cash fixed cost base, we call it TCFC, across our businesses in Europe. We recognize the external challenges that that business faces. Every line item has an owner, every owner has a target. And that's how you get that number down. That's reviewed every month. I review it every other month with them. And essentially, that level of focus and attention is what gets those costs. And that's where you find wastage, you find duplication, you find opportunities to improve processes. It's something that happens continuously. We don't do that for a recession. We don't do that when we have good times. We do that every day, every month.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We move to John Roberts of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Roberts: Thank you. Nice quarter. The after-tax return on capital of 20% is at record levels, and it's still going higher. How does that compare with returns on new sale of gas projects? And how high do you think it can go before customers start shifting to sale of plant instead?
Matthew White: Hi, John. It's Matt. I think maybe to explain probably why we're getting the 20% might be better. And then hopefully that will help address your question. The way -- our expectation of risk reward and returns hasn't changed much. And when I think about what returns we're getting on our on-site projects, that also hasn't changed very much. The reason this metric continues to improve, the obvious reason, is the numerator, which is [indiscernible] is growing much faster than the denominator, which is our capital base. And the reason that's happening is the integrated model that we have is enabling our non-capital intensive businesses, and this includes our engineering business, this includes our packaged business, our merchant business, and even some of what I'll call the global other businesses are growing at a very strong rate, generating cash without the need for capital. So it's the integration of the model that is enabling this return on capital performance, rather than a singular view of what a return expectation is on a single project. This is why the density model we view is so important for cash generation and return on capital and profitable continual stable growth, which is how we deem a way to create value in this space. So that's really what's driving it. It's the integrated model. It's the density model. And it's a lot of the non-capital intensive businesses continuing to contribute rather than us changing our return expectations.
John Roberts: And then secondly, do the higher gas prices actually benefit the hydrogen business? I think you're constantly improving the yields and efficiencies at your plants, and I think you get to keep those energy savings. So even though the efficiency gains are small, they're worth a lot more now with these kinds of super high gas prices. So is that becoming material?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, I'd suggest there are two ways to think about this. There is a customer view and then there is the internal view. You're absolutely right on the internal view where obviously the higher the gas price, the more benefit we get from our productivity program or efficiency programs, and that flows in. And clearly, when you looking at margin expansion, our margin expansion is a consequence of actions we take on pricing actions, we take on productivity, all of that falls into that and kind of gets factored in. The other piece that I'd just offer is there is another perspective to this, which is what is happening with their customers who are seeing higher gas prices? I gave the example of oxyfuel wins that we had in the first half, 10 wins. That was -- the momentum is picking up on that. Here what tends to happen is as natural gas pricing moves up, our customers are looking at ways to both reduce costs, but also substitute and that's where our applications come into play and we have an opportunity then on the upside to try and understand where those volumes can be placed, where we could get those mid to long-term contracts put in to ensure that we're able to then sustain some of that growth that we want to see happen as a consequence of our applications as well.
John Roberts: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We move to Peter Clark of Société Générale. Please go ahead.
Peter Clark: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just on the U.S. packaged gas business, which obviously has been a great business for you and you have been winning share. I just wanted to check on the industrial gas side of that in the packaged gases that you've actually still got growth there. So I'm excluding healthcare and I'm excluding electronics, because the number one actually saw some softening I think in the second quarter. So that's the first question.
Sanjiv Lamba: So the U.S. packaged gases business, Peter to your point, is a very strong business. You've heard me talk about this before. And we are still seeing mid to high double digit growth on the gases side, right? When we talk about our packaged business, we tend to separate that into gases and hard goods. And I have to say both segments are growing reasonably well, strong pricing and good volume growth continuing in that space.
Peter Clark: Got it. Then a second question, well done on GIST. Obviously Linde AG had a crack at this six years ago and then had to give up. So I'm reading from this, you definitely think it's going to happen, but we don't expect a big windfall from it, obviously given the profitability in the UK outlook and logistics.
Sanjiv Lamba: That's correct. As you know, we've been trying to -- as you point out, Linde AG had the challenge of trying to get rid of it for a while, non-core business, no single digit margins on this. So we'll see some sales come off, but from a profitability perspective, it was a drag and it will help kind of get us out of that.
Peter Clark: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We now move to Christopher Parkinson of Mizuho for your next question. Please go ahead.
Christopher Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Can we just get a very quick update on how you're viewing the helium market over the intermediate to long term just given the past events in Russia, the sale of the BLM? I'd be very curious to just hear your perspectives over the next few years. Thank you so much.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Chris. Helium is a very global business. As you know, it's different in many ways to our more traditional industrial gases. The ability to have multiple sources and diversify that helps. As I look ahead more broadly at the kind of overall industry level, I'd say to you in the short term very tight, in the kind of intermediate midterm I'd say to you largely tight until new sources come on and get fully ramped up. Longer term, you might see that come back into some level of balance. And when you think about sources coming on, there is usually a lead time anywhere between two to three, three and a half years for sources to come online and then be available to you. There was an expectation in the market that sources in Russia would come online. Obviously, with everything that's happening over there, that's going to have its own set of challenges, which is why I say in the short to mid-term, you should expect that market to remain tight. As far as BLM is concerned, it's a little bit of a tragedy. It's been run so poorly. Everyone's been impacted by that, as you know. We expect that as the government comes to a decision on how BLM goes forward, there'll be some relief over there, but really from being a very large source, BLM has declined over the many years and therefore will probably not be the substantive source going forward for us. We do see Middle East having potential to kind of grow new sources and we're seeing some traction over there already on that.
Christopher Parkinson: That's very helpful. And just as a quick follow up, turning back to the electronics market and the semiconductors within that, I guess it gets an 8 billion market growing in the high single digits, perhaps even low doubles. Just given your exposure across on-site spec, bulk and everything that can flow in to the multiple facets there, how much of that is really turning out to be a competitive advantage, just given the outlook, especially in geographies outside of Asia? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: So I'd say that in our recent win in TSMC for their first, a couple of fabs, in the U.S. was the ability to leverage both our technology offer and our existing relationship with TSMC out of Taiwan. So that was a competitive advantage that we were able to leverage given our operating experience with them and given their kind of confidence in what we offer. But we do have a technology upside. I mentioned this earlier on. I feel from a technology and an operating expertise point of view, we bring something that is super important for fabs which is high reliability on highly spec product. You have to meet the spec every time and you have to be extremely reliable. And that's where our competitive advantage, given our own engineering division and their ability to do R&D on these new plants, drives a lot of our innovation and drives some of that competitive advantage that we look at. So I feel there is that advantage with customers that we have and the relationships we carry, the advantage around the operating expertise that we have. And then, of course, technology becomes a tipping point for us to win.
Christopher Parkinson: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. We now move to David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Sanjiv or Matt, you're hedging -- can you talk about your hedging strategy in Europe? And is there an earnings headwind as you roll into next year, given the higher natural gas prices over there?
Sanjiv Lamba: David, we don't really hedge. I'll let Matt comment around the financial hedges. But as far as sourcing is concerned, we essentially have contracts in place based on which we source both electricity and natural gas. Matt, do you want to talk about it?
Matthew White: I would agree. It's absolutely right. We don't utilize financial hedges for commodities of any consequence, of any materiality. To Sanjiv's point, we just have commodity purchase contracts. And then we have contractual structures with our customers for pass through. So that is how we manage it around the world. And that's how we'll continue to manage it.
David Begleiter: Understood. And just to go back to the first question on the take or pay contracts in Europe and Germany, if you guys can't operate due to natural gas curtailments, do you still get paid your base facility fee?
Sanjiv Lamba: Yes. So despite disruptions or volatility around the LNG piece, our contracts very clearly ensure that our -- conditions ensure we get paid a base facility fee.
David Begleiter: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Sanjiv, can you provide an update on clean hydrogen project activity? You've talked in the past about 300 projects with 20 billion of potential and 5 billion to Linde on a probability adjusted basis. How are things progressing with your industrial customers or opportunities in particular? And when do you think that the flow into the pipeline will become more meaningful for you?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Kevin. So let me just headline that first and then talk a little bit about the progress that's happening. So at the headline level, I'd say to you, we have between 290 to 300 projects that we're working on. A large number of those projects tend to be on the mobility side. They are smaller projects, so I tend to focus a lot more around what I see on the industrial space. I've said before, this is right in our wheelhouse. This is customers we work with extensively and who want to work with us as they move down the chain looking at either blue or green hydrogen or ammonia, et cetera. And then there's the energy export piece, which you will see some specific areas of development. Again, there we are seeing larger projects, fewer number of those relative to what we see in mobility, but larger projects, and some of them come with substance. And again, in that space, we only work on projects where we've got off-take agreements or potential off-takers participating in the project who have skin in the game. For us, that's very critical in how we define our investment criteria for projects that we want to undertake in that space. In terms of progress, typically, Kevin, these projects have a long -- and I'm now talking about the industrial and the MG export piece in particular, they tend to have long lead timelines driven around the fact that they have to do typically a pre-feed study to try and understand the scope of what the project would look like. They then undertake a feed to try and get a better understanding of what the technical solution is. And then they take it to FID. That process itself between the pre-feed and a FID could take anywhere between two to three and a half years. It's beyond that, that when you have a FID or a decision in investment that we're able to move forward and actually make the decisions and start deploying and putting that into our backlog. So, I see good progress across a number of the projects that I've outlined to you on the industrial and the energy export side. And of course, the smaller projects on the mobility, they are constantly moving and these are small hydrogen refueling stations or a small electrolyzer here of there and they are moving, and I feel good about that. We're also seeing a whole new set of projects emerge around liquid hydrogen. I feel pretty good about that liquid hydrogen. Linde has some great technology. We have a technology competitive advantage in that space. And again, we are feeling that deploying that and creating a liquid hydrogen network ecosystem is going to be quite important for us as well. So looking to see that develop further as well, but that's catching up pace as well in the projects that we're working through. On the overall piece, you mentioned 20 billion. I'd say that's probably higher than that at this point in time in terms of the total landscape of projects that we're looking at.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you for that color. And secondly, if I may for Matt, can you speak to some of the assumptions that are embedded in your new EPS guidance range? It sounds like you're baking in some level of negative macro activity at the south end of your range? And also, where are you marking currency amidst all the volatility that's occurred?
Matthew White: Sure, Kevin. I'll start with the FX side. We'll obviously book the average rates at the end of each period like you are supposed to for U.S. GAAP. But what we used for the guidance itself, we just took spot rates a few weeks ago. Now looking back, we probably took it more at what looks like right now at least the bottom point, so where rates have come has been a little bit better. So time will tell. But we just had to make an assumption, and that assumption was what we put in. Obviously, we will book what the rates are when they're completed. So right now, this was a point in time, probably two to three weeks ago, spot rates. As far as the macro, you're right. The top end right now, it essentially has no real volume growth. The assumptions there have some puts and takes. So we do have -- you would expect to be some natural sequential decline in places like EMEA for some of the holiday effects, also just given what's going on there. You may have some increases from certain project contribution or some other areas growing, and that nets out to essentially no growth. And then as you go down, that's mostly just lower volume assumptions. And as I mentioned, this is not what we're predicting. It's just what's baked in the guidance. And so if things turn out to be better, that would be upside. Right now, through July we really haven't seen much negative changes from June but we'll have to see. One month so far doesn't make a quarter. And we'll see how it plays out.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you very much everyone for attending. If you guys have any further questions, feel free to reach out. Have a great rest of your day. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde Plc First Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, Sergey. Good morning everyone and thank you for attending our 2022 first quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during the teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Sanjiv will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde's first quarter financial performance and outlook. After which, we will wrap up with Q&A.  Let me now turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by addressing the recent global events and the tragedy occurring in Ukraine. A senseless invasion has caused widespread casualties and destruction at a level not seen in Europe for generations. As a global company, integrated within countless communities across the globe, Linde must do its part to help. I'm happy to report that all of our 121 Ukrainian employees are safe. And I'm incredibly proud of the courage and determination they've demonstrated throughout the crisis, including several who've chosen to continue producing and delivering life-saving medical gases. We are supporting their needs directly and indirectly, including through contributions of approximately $2 million.  I can only pray that all the global pressure and support is enough to bring this war to an end and allow the efforts to begin towards healing and rebuilding Ukraine. Given these circumstances, we are scaling back gas operations in Russia. We have already seized supply to certain customers and initiated the divestment process for some industrial assets. All in, an effort to reduce our footprint, which is already quite small at approximately 1% of sales.  Furthermore, we have stopped new investments and business development while winding down several engineering projects. Given this, we have removed second half Russian earnings contribution from the guidance. Matt will speak more on this. However, we are scaling back responsibly as we continue to support our employees and their efforts to supply critical gases for medical and safety needs. Now in the light of uncertain economic climate, I thought it would be helpful to highlight trends we're seeing by end markets and geographies. Let me now go on to Slide 3, which gives you a summary of Q1 growth rates by key end markets. Two overarching points are that the organic growth of 9% from a strong 2021 foundation and broad-based increases across both consumer and industrial-related end markets. At 17% of sales, healthcare trends are roughly flat as greater medical procedures in the developed markets were offset by lower hospital oxygen in developing markets such as Latin America and Eastern Europe. Now fortunately, it appears COVID oxygen needs are abating. So I expect health care to return to its long-term growth rate of mid-single-digit percentage as we continue to expand patient offerings for both hospital and home. Food and Beverage continues robust year-on-year growth as most parts of the world have returned to restaurant dining as well as increased applications for bulk food and beverage production. This resilient market should grow low to mid-single-digit percent. Note that the sequential trend is down due to normal seasonality from fourth quarter holiday season. Electronics at 9% of sales remains one of our fastest-growing end markets, especially in Americas and APAC. The primary gas is sold to these customers are ultra-high purity nitrogen, hydrogen, helium and rare gases. That includes neon, which represents less than 1% of total sales. However, given the amount of attention this molecule has recently received, it's fair to say that we're well positioned as one of the largest producers of neon in the world, with the vast majority of it being refined at our own sites in the U.S. and Germany. We are, of course, working closely with our customers to address their increased demand. The electronics market grew 13% versus last year with a mix of underlying growth and project start-ups, and I fully expect to announce more new project wins during the course of this year. Turning to industrial end markets. Chemicals and Energy up 24% of sales grew double digit, led by the Americas, which drove more than half of that increase. We are seeing very strong demand across all phases of energy development as U.S. refining rates are close to record levels, driving even more demand for hydrogen and other gases. In addition, merchant hydrogen volumes rose by almost 60% from the last year in support of clean energy initiatives.  Our chemical customers in the U.S. are some of the lowest cost producers in the world and thus saw high demand for their end products, requiring significant on-site gas supply. The current combination of high energy prices and transition to clean energy should drive continued growth in this end market for years to come. To this point, we are currently reviewing close to 300 clean energy projects, with the probability weighted spend exceeding $5 billion for these clean energy projects. So I feel quite good about our prospects for future growth in this space. Metals & Mining at 14% of sales grew 7% from last year and 5% sequentially as lower volumes in China were more than offset by other regions, increasing their production to meet global demand. Americas improved sequentially and from prior year as U.S. based steel mills increased production in support of higher industrial activity. In APAC, lower Chinese steel volumes were mostly offset by higher production from other countries. As the world races to replace Russian-based mining metals and energy sources, I expect to see our customers continue to increase their production and investment levels. Finally, the manufacturing end market grew 11% from the last year and 4% sequentially. Versus prior year, growth was broad-based in every segment, but led by the Americas from increased aerospace and general manufacturing. Now last week, we announced another new long-term agreement with a major space launch company to provide rocket propulsion gases out of our recently expanded Florida plant. Currently, rocket and satellite propulsion demand is at its highest level we've ever seen, going as far back as the NASA's Apollo program. Linde is proud to be leading industrial gas supplier to all key players in the U.S. based program. Looking ahead, there are clearly concerns around energy security, especially in Europe, which could result in persistent inflation. Additionally, shortages of Russian source commodities, coupled with Chinese production curtailments from COVID could put additional pressure on global production levels. Regardless of what ultimately happens in the economy, Linde has demonstrated time and time again that we weather the storm better than most.  We have a committed team, a high-performance culture and an integrated network across all three supply modes, that's why I'm confident Linde will continue being the best performing industrial gases and engineering company in the world.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matt to walk through the financial numbers.
Matthew White : Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the first quarter results. Sales of $8.2 billion increased 13% from prior year but declined 1% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Versus prior year, cost pass-through increased 6% from a contractual billing of higher energy costs, but currency translation reduced sales by 3% from a stronger U.S. dollar, primarily against the euro and pound sterling.  Excluding these items, organic sales grew 9% from 3% more volume split between project backlog and base and 6% more pricing as we continue to price to inflation. Recall that actual price increases are much higher for the combined packaged and merchant gases. Sequentially, when excluding the 1% currency headwind, organic sales increased 2% as 3% higher pricing was partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. The volume decline was driven by lower EMEA medical oxygen and seasonal effects from food and beverage, Chinese New Year and Southern Hemisphere LPG. Engineering volumes are up 1% from prior year, but down 2% sequentially as we have begun winding down several Russian projects, and we expect that trend to continue into Q2. Operating profit of $1.9 billion increased 13% from 2021 and 3% sequentially. The operating margin of 23.2% is roughly flat with prior year, but up 100 basis points from the fourth quarter. The contractual cost pass-through has no effect on operating profit dollars, but will impact operating margins as we adjust both sales and cost with energy prices. Excluding this effect, operating margins are up 130 basis points from prior year and 120 basis points sequentially. You can see the table to the right, showing underlying margins by geographic segment, with almost all up triple digits across both periods. Despite the unprecedented geopolitical events and subsequent inflationary pressure, the business quality continues to improve, and we anticipate that margins ex cost pass-through should increase going forward. You may have noticed the higher than normal engineering segment margins at 19.6% and lower-than-normal global other operating profit at a $44 million loss. These are driven by project timing differences and one-off costs, which both should return to normal run rate levels by the second quarter.  EPS of $2.93 increased 18% from last year and 6% sequentially, as we continue to demonstrate strong leverage down the entire income statement. Disciplined capital management is supporting lower interest costs and reduced share count, which I'll speak to more on the next slide.  The final number I'd like to highlight is return on capital, which represents one of the most important financial metrics in our industry. Three years ago, this figure was 10.4%. Today, we're at 18.9% and still growing. This progress doesn't happen overnight. It requires a sustained high performance culture across all levels of the business. We're quite confident that Linde is and will continue to be a long-term value compounder with a healthy blend of high-quality growth, tremendous resilience and significant shareholder returns. Slide 5 provides more color on our capital management trends. Q1 operating cash flow of $2 billion was slightly below last year, due to unfavorable working capital timing in January and February. While March was a much stronger month, it wasn't enough to catch up. I expect improvements in Q2 as our DSO and DPO levels are still quite stable. Also recall that Q1 tends to be one of the weakest quarters of the year due to cash payment timing. Engineering cash flow was positive in Q1, but down year-over-year on project payment timing. In light of the accelerated Russian project wind downs, I expect more payment outflows to vendors as we closed out several projects, consistent with how all projects are closed out, but at a significantly faster pace. Overall, I still anticipate a full year operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio in the low to mid-80% range. As far as how we deployed that cash, we announced a 10% dividend increase for 2022, which marks the 29th consecutive year of dividend increases. We also announced a new $10 billion share repurchase program on February 20, of which we've already spent $1.7 billion by the end of April. And of course, we will always reinvest in the business, which is our priority for capital.  Despite the economic challenges, we still have access to low-cost capital as evidenced by our most recent bond deal. We issued over €2 billion across three tranches. And as you can see, the attractive pricing, we had a weighted average maturity of 10 years with a weighted average coupon of 1.4%. Irrespective of the economic climate, we will maintain a steady and predictable capital allocation policy to invest in the business while rewarding shareholders. I'll finish up on Slide six, which provides the updated earnings outlook. Second quarter guidance range of $2.90 to $3, represents 7% to 11% growth over prior year or 10% to 14% when excluding currency translation impact. For the full year, the new guidance range is $11.65 to $11.90, a 9% to 11% growth rate from 2021 or 11% to 13% when adjusting for currency. Both estimates have two key underlying assumptions. First, there is no assumed base economic growth at the midpoint. Consistent with last quarter, this is not our economic projection but rather a placeholder for the guidance. You can insert your own view of the economy. If it does better, we will do better. And if it does worse, we'll take actions to mitigate.  Second, we have removed contribution of Russian earnings by the second half of the year. As we continue to wind down engineering projects, cease certain operations and sell industrial assets, we felt it was appropriate to remove Russian earnings from the outlook and associated projects from the backlog. These actions are ongoing. So we anticipate some residual earnings in Q2, which are projected to cease by Q3. While this is a fluid situation with many complexities, we are committed to following all sanctions and scaling down operations in a safe manner. Overall, despite economic uncertainties, we are raising the full year outlook. In fact, as Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has demonstrated industry-leading performance year after year. We only need to look at the last three years to prove that.  At the start of 2019, when some investors doubted the merits of the merger, we quickly came together as one and grew EPS 19%, finishing the year at an all-time high stock price. Moving into 2020, when the pandemic struck Linde stock was sold off from apparent concerns of too much cyclicality without enough resiliency only to ultimately achieve 12% EPS growth and finished the year at a new all-time high stock price. And when 2021 began, Linde stock was once again sold off. This time, from apparent concerns of too much resiliency without enough cyclicality. And yet, we grew EPS by 30%, and once again, finished the year at another new all-time high stock price.  Now in 2022, Linde stock has been sold off again from concerns of economic uncertainty and high inflation. Time will tell how we ultimately finish this year, but personally, I like our odds.  I'll now turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Mike Sison: Hey guys, nice start to the year. I guess at the midpoint, where you're talking about no assumed economic growth, what type of volume growth will you be able to generate? And maybe talk about each of the regions as you sort of walk us through that?
Sanjiv Lamba : Mike, so this is Sanjiv. I just want to kind of first lay out the guidance point that Matt just talked about and then talk a little bit about what we see in the regions going across. So Matt pointed out that at the midpoint of our full year guidance, we have currently assumed there is no help from the economy at all. So that's a 0% kind of volume benefit that we're getting over there. And he's also suggested that you can go ahead and put your assumption on what do you think the economy is going to do and recognize where that end result might look like. If the economy does better than that, obviously, we'll do better. If it doesn't, again, to just kind of reiterate what he said, we will take mitigation actions, as you've seen us do previously.  Now I think I want to just kind of relate that and then move on and talk about the end markets and really give you a sense of how I see the three important segments that we have. I think that will give you a sense of what the market is currently looking at. So let's start off with the Americas. Strong underlying demand in there. We are seeing that reflected across all the key end markets we participate in chemicals and refining doing extremely well.  Healthcare has been flat, but you know there is an offset of increased elective procedures versus a slight decline, certainly in Latin America, if you will, on the COVID need for medical oxygen as well, which is a good thing in truth. And then we are obviously seeing semiconductor continue to see growth as well. Manufacturing and largely kind of manifested through our packaged and hard-goods side of the business doing extremely well, the U.S. package and hot goods kind of running at about -- well, double-digit growth for the quarter again, which has been fairly consistent over the last few quarters. I want to maybe highlight refining specifically, if I may, up about 30% year-on-year for us. Very strong, solid growth coming out of refining. Obviously, we're seeing -- that includes some start-up impact there for us as well, but we're seeing refineries run flat out. Utilization rates above 90%. Crack spreads at $38 at the moment, we haven't seen these levels in mid-2000s, if you will. So again, all looking pretty strong from the underlying demand patterns we see out of the Americas.  I'll move on quickly to APAC and just tell you that we see broad-based consistent underlying demand growth. I'm going to talk about China for a moment and briefly cover that as well. But broad-based across the rest of Asia Pacific and kind of reasonably strong and stable underlying demand as we see the markets today. China clearly, you're reading the press all about lockdowns, et cetera. We are seeing those lockdowns play out in Q2, if you will. I'm finding the on-site side of our business holding reasonably well. Yes, there is some impact on the merchant side, small and medium enterprises, obviously, a little bit more impacted over there. We did see the volumes kind of take a little bit of a drop early on in April, but they have stabilized, still a little bit short of where we expect them to be. My forecast is for the rest of the quarter, we aren't likely to see anything significant happen over there. And just so you know, we factored that into our guidance as well. Lastly, EMEA and that really is a bit of a wildcard, I have to tell you, I have been surprised by how the EMEA business has held up, the on-site volumes as well as the merchant side of the business, huge resiliency over there. Obviously, you know what's happening to energy prices, and you can see our pricing numbers in EMEA as well, making sure that we're pricing to inflation, even catching up on prior catch-ups that we talked about.  We said to you previously we kind of catch up on pricing over one to two quarters. You can see that come through. And obviously, the operating margins ex pass-through demonstrating that up 130 basis points year-on-year sequentially, 120 basis points, up across every segment that we have as well.  So again, pretty solid in terms of the quarter one. Really, I think the unknown of it there is what happens to energy more broadly. And of course, you hear the news about what happens to natural gas sourcing, et cetera. I'm not going to speculate there, Mike. Just as far as the underlying business itself is concerned and how we're managing it, I'm really pleased with how the EMEA guys -- the team is managing that and they are -- they will work through every contingency that happens. We've got a strong team over there able to do that. So it's a bit exhaustive as an answer, but I just thought I'd kind of give you that broader perspective.
Mike Sison: Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up. Industrial gases tends to help customers reduce their energy costs. So your sale of gas backlog has been pretty steady at $3.5 billion. Are you seeing sort of more bidding potential? And does the backlog potentially go up as in this inflationary environment?
Sanjiv Lamba: Absolutely, Mike. So the short answer to that is, yes, we are seeing a lot more proposal activity. On the sale of gas backlog, just a reminder, that about $1 billion of that is coming off this year, which means we are starting up projects, best kind of projects I like that get some bring revenue and earnings in the course of the year. So that's good to see. We're filling that back up with $1 billion more of project wins that we expect are kind of developing and fairly advanced.  And I expect -- I do expect actually that backlog to continue to creep up and move in the right direction. So yes, lots more activity and across a whole range of end markets as well, energy, refining, chemicals, electronics manufacturing. So again, broad-based, solid proposal activity, which I think will translate into wins. We just have to see how quickly we can lock that in. 
Mike Sison: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. 
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. Sanjiv, can you comment on your outlook for return on capital. You had an impressive level of 18.9% in the quarter. Can you continue to move that higher? And how do you view ROC in the context of rising interest rates? Are you starting to take higher cost of debt, for example, into your project bidding? And have you seen that in the marketplace as well as it relates to your peers?
Sanjiv Lamba: Kevin, I'll kind of quickly give you a response to that. I think -- and then get Matt is passionate about this, so I'm going to let him have a walk through this as well. ROC, I've said this before, you've kind of heard and I've been quoted on this truth serum for an industry like us. It's sometimes surprise when I look at our peer group that we really do stand out. There's a lot of hard work that goes into that, managing both the numerator and the denominator remain critical. And we do that day in and day out, as you know. That's how we run our business. We run it every day to make sure that we kind of get through on that.  So these are record ROC levels for our industry. Our industry hasn't seen this record and comes from that daily operational aspects of the business and then managing a very disciplined capital approach all of that kind of feeds into that. Our aspiration will remain to continue to grow that. But ROC, as you know, is a function of the various factors that go into play that I mentioned earlier on. And as we see CapEx buildout happen and the ramps take place, there will always be some captures that happens around that ROC piece. Matt?
Matthew White: Yes, sure. Kevin, I can just add a few points to that. I think as far as the outlook, it's probably safe to say we're overachieving with what some of your expectations probably were. And the obvious answer is we're growing earnings faster than our capital base, but I think the underlying thing to take into consideration is we are less capital intensive than I think people realize. We have a lot of avenues of growth that don't require significant capital.  We're demonstrating that through our end markets. We're demonstrating that through our supply modes of package and some of the other services we have, and we see a continued opportunity to see expansion of return on capital through significant growth that does not require significant capital.  Now of course, we have great opportunities for large projects that we're going to pursue and that we're going to win. But we also have a very diverse business that allows us strong year in, year out growth without the need of significant capital. And as far as the inflation impact on what you asked, we get asked this question when rates rise, when rates fall. We get asked over and over again, and we have the same answer, which is we take a very long-term view.  When we lock in these projects, these are 15-, 20-year views, and we don't try to estimate what inflation or rates will do, rather, we protect ourselves against inflation on how we contract both on the execution and the long-term fees that we will charge for facility fees. So given that we build a model that is independent of what Fed do around the world and how inflation is structured. And I think our results recently have demonstrated that. And I think our results, during the disinflationary periods, post the great financial crisis showed that. So from that perspective, we build it agnostic of it and just to generate value for the long term.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you for that. Matt, secondly, if I may, can you walk us through the financial impact from your exit in Russia as it relates to earnings and also any cash flows associated with the exit costs there?
Matthew White: Sure, Kevin. So to be clear on how we did this, it starts with the guidance. And what we want to do in the guidance, as we stated, is by the second half remove any impact from Russia and that includes projects or our business in the gas, which is about 1%. As we stated on the prepared remarks, it's a fluid situation. This is something that we are committed to scaling back. We're committed to reducing our footprint, obviously, following all the sanctions and it's something that we're continuously working on, but we wanted to take the prudent and conservative view of removing that impact going forward.  As we stated, the gas business is about a little less than 1% of sales and corresponding operating profit and assets. In the Engineering business, obviously, you saw the effect of the backlog of those projects, and they're continuing to work through. From a cash perspective, I'd separate into two pieces. There's, obviously, the normal aspect, as I mentioned, where when you wind down projects in this type of percent completion business, it is a normal outflow. That is a normal part of this business. You get paid up front. And then as you work the project down, you pay your vendors and you cover the cost to build that project. We fully expect that same effect. It will just be on a more accelerated path than what it normally would have been.  Separately, on the deposits that we have upfront at this stage, we see the need for them. That is something we don't see a significant effect other than obviously working through paying vendors and paying the cost to wind down the projects. And as I stated, we still anticipate that operating cash flow to EBITDA will be low to mid-80s for this year, considering all these items. So that's how I think you should think about it and model it.
Kevin McCarthy: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: P.J. Juvekar, Citi. Please go ahead. 
P.J. Juvekar : Yes. Hi, good morning. Sanjiv, some have suggested that with the rise of natural gas prices in Europe, the cost of green hydrogen today is same as cost of gray hydrogen. So you would think that Europe would accelerate green hydrogen, which would make sense from sort of energy security standpoint. Have you seen any increased discussions and initial orders or anything about green hydrogen in Europe?
Sanjiv Lamba: P.J., that's a good question. Obviously, very topical at the moment. So what we are seeing is clearly the intent in Europe, even prior to this current crisis, the intent in Europe to move down the path of green. Obviously, that difference between green and gray is narrowing, certainly in Europe. The constrained -- so from a policy point of view, clearly, we see that there is greater momentum, if anything, coming out of this current crisis leading to that green road map.  The challenge, P.J., lies in the ability to scale up green production and the ability to access renewable energy and the ability to get all of that together to then produce hydrogen and find a carrier that makes it cost effective once it's landed at scale, and that's where the challenge lies. So we are, obviously, working closely with a number of different customers who are very keen to go down that path.  You would have seen announcements we made. We got 2 into 100 megawatts. So that's a 200 megawatt order from RWE to work to kind of get their energy balance up from a green hydrogen point of view. But again, all of those projects take time and the scalability continues to be a little bit of a challenge.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And I have a question on Neon. You mentioned you are supplying the U.S. and Germany. I believe you're adding some new capacity as well. And can you talk about sort of supply-demand of neon, I know a lot of that was in Ukraine. And then also, you talked about onshoring. And if electronics are onshoring, you see Intel build big clients. Do you have the supply in the U.S. to supply if the need comes up?
Sanjiv Lamba: P.J., sure. So let me just take a step back and give you the overview and then let's get into the details in terms of where we stand. So the overview is about one-third of the world's refined neon comes out of Ukraine and Russia, about a third. Most players around the world have that sourcing built into their model. We are lucky in that our refining capacities really sit in Germany and U.S. and free the entire world. So our kind of dependence on Ukraine and Russia is in the mid-teens, if you will, relative to other people being around at third. That positions us well.  Obviously, prior to all of this happening in terms of the war in Ukraine, last year, we'd already made decisions, recognizing that semiconductor growth and, in fact, even space were likely to make rare gas demand continue to grow. So we're going to see some of that capacity come online this year and some early next year as well.  As far as things stand, you referenced Germany and the U.S., we produce refined neon in Germany and the U.S. to multiple locations, which ensures that we're able to meet the entire global demand out of these locations. Of course, we can also meet all the onshoring needs that our customers like Intel, Samsung, TSMC, and others have in terms of coming out of either Germany or the U.S. as well. So we are very well positioned, and we are, of course, the largest producer of refined neon in the world. 
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. When I look at your electronics sales or sales growth. It seems that you're taking market share in that area as best as I can tell. Is that true? And Air Products and Air Liquide and Linde are all very, very competent companies that supply the electronics industry. Is there something that you can now technically do that the other two companies find it more difficult to do? Or are the wins that you're achieving more the result of intangibles, better service or better customer relationships?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Jeff. So the electronics wins that we had last year, Jeff, and you've heard me say this before in the last quarter as well. We did about $1 billion worth of project wins last year. And I may not have said this already, but I'm going to just say this now, which is that I expect that we'll have a healthy project backlog growth this year from electronics as well. So clearly, it does point to the fact that we are providing a solution to our customers that is very appealing for them. And that's really a combination. I think you hit on all of the elements within that.  We have some great technology. We've been able to take the relationships that we had with the practical relationship with Samsung with Linde's relationship with TSMC and both dealing with Intel. We've been able to take that and be able to kind of create both solutions, leveraging relationships and of course, operational excellence, which is critical as far as electronics business is concerned. Those fabs want to see highly reliable, extremely safe operations, and we are able to package all of that and bring it to bear to get those win rates up where we like to see them.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. And just a follow up. When I look at your income statement, it seems that your SG&A costs, again, I think last year, they were about flat. And this year, at least in the first quarter, they're up a couple of percent. There's really no movement in research and development expenses. How do you keep your overhead growing at such a slow rate?
Sanjiv Lamba: I'm going to kind of touch on the principle of that and just kind of tell you how we look at that business every day, essentially, Jeff, as you've probably heard me say it before. So when we think about how we manage our business and how we leverage what comes at the top line right down to the bottom, we think about it, coming through our variable margin. So that's where the productivity measures kick in and then tight management of total cash fixed costs. That's something that gets attention every month. It's something that our guys are managing every day.  And as part of that, the sales and admin costs are something where we spend a lot of time scrutinizing. Now how does productivity play a role over there? Jeff, you've heard me talk about digital solutions previously.  One of the things we do extremely well around our productivity actions, particularly when it comes to the fixed cost piece, is actively provide a lot of digital solutions into that space to make sure you're automating, to make sure that you're taking out where possible you're taking our heads were possibly taking out effort. And I think all of that plays into that effort around managing your total cash fixed cost and within that, the subset being SG&A. I won't say to you that's rocket science there, Jeff. It's just the grind of managing that every day.
Jeff Zekauskas: It looks like rocket science to me. Thanks so much.
Sanjiv Lamba: I could get excited by rocket, but we'll talk about that later.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicola Tang from BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead. 
Nicola Tang : Hi, everyone. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more around kind of energy security and energy diversification, which has obviously been a topic in Europe, in particular on the back of the conflict. And we talked a little bit about green hydrogen already on this call. But I was wondering if you could discuss whether Linde could play a part in terms of helping to diversify energy sources say, through LNG, for example, which is part of the EU -- repower EU initiative?  And then the second question also related to energy security is, if we did, hypothetically, see energy rationalization or curtailments in terms of access to Russian gas, et cetera. Can you discuss what the impact might be on Linde in that scenario? For example, would your take-or-pay contracts on-site business still be valid? I just have to understand a little bit more. Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Nicola. So let me start off by just talking about the energy diversity actions that are happening across Europe, in particular, as we speak and the role we could play in that. So we have actually as you think about it, as more capacity gets released on the engineering side, we have now the ability to go out and provide a greater focus around supporting governments and countries in their search for that energy diversity.  So I clearly see us playing a role around the LNG development that happens, given that we have that core competence around that. And obviously, we are in dialogue at the moment with a number of governments in looking and developing projects that will help support that. Now that does take a little bit of time. As you know, these are complex projects, but we are pleased that we have a role to play in there. Of course, EUs focus and the rebar kind of effort and policy statements, clearly have set out the intent of how that diversified energy portfolio will become crucial. We talked a little bit about clean hydrogen earlier on. I do see that in all our discussions that we're having with a number of these governments that, that intent will translate into action.  I have to tell you that I am a little more optimistic now that there will be a role between green and blue. I think the recognition around the fact that blue hydrogen or blue ammonia will provide a good bridge to ultimately go in green, which is what we think a pragmatic policy direction would look like. I am seeing that there is a little more traction to that. And there is a general realization that scale up on blue can happen more quickly.  Now all of this does mean, however, that there will be a combination of local projects, many of which will be green and imported in the elements of carriers that will provide either ammonia as an energy source, as an example, or hydrogen itself, either piked or in liquid form. And we see again that there's greater openness to understanding how those logistical challenges will get dealt with across countries and kind of setting out regimes just as Germany has using contract for differences as an example, to try and make sure that they get access to these developments that happen elsewhere in the world, allowing that import market to actually be set up and build the infrastructure that then allows that distribution of that energy to take place as well. So all in, I'd say to you that Linde has a role to play, both from a point of view of the engineering that we can provide into that space and also in participating in the kind of downstream efforts that happen once that energy is made available. So I do feel good about that. I have to be honest and tell you, though, that all of this does take longer than people would like it to take. All of us would like to see this happen in the next few months, but unfortunately, these things tend to take years rather than months. Now just talking about the energy curtailment piece that you briefly referenced. Obviously, as you would expect, we have a business company planning effort in Europe across most of our countries, in fact. And in Germany, in particular, we have run a number of different scenarios. We are actively engaged with both the power and natural gas providers but also for the governments locally.  There is a -- as you would appreciate, there is a part of our business, the air separation side, where we are providing crucial products, including medical oxygen to hospitals, which gets prioritized by government. So we appreciate that they understand that criticality of that. And then on the other side, we don't have any direct exposure to Russian natural gas, but we do recognize that some of our customers will do that, and we are kind of working with governments and customers to make sure that we have those contingency plans in place. I can also -- I know the Polish example is top of mind for everyone. Just to give you a kind of sense on that, from our perspective, we will see a little more impact from those developments.
Nicola Tang : Thank you. And maybe I can give you an opportunity, Sanjiv, to talk about rockets and just ask a little bit on the side of the business. On Helium, you've announced this offtake agreement with Freeport from 2024 onwards. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for the helium market, given I think there's some supply disruptions elsewhere? And just remind us maybe how big your exposure is? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. So thanks, Nicola. I appreciate that question. I'm going to talk about Rocket for get excited about it and then touch on helium a little bit and wrap it up. So as far as rockets are concerned, aerospace for us represents about 2% of our sales. And at some point, I think we're going to designate its own end market. It's been growing strong double digits for us for quite some time. And Linde is the largest supplier in this entire sector. So we're quite proud of that.  Our rockets consume many gases. And while it's primarily liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, some helium, often liquid nitrogen for densification of the fuel that is used. We also use Crypton and Xenon to help satellites with their propulsion systems to keep them in orbit. In addition to that, the reason I get excited is because here, we're able to bring a full benefit of Linde's portfolio, and we provide atomized powders for advanced manufacturing or 3D printing as it were for specific components and parts. And we also provide some specialized coatings out of our PST unit.  So all in, it's kind of a comprehensive package of solutions that we can bring to these companies. And obviously, they greatly appreciate that. And I expect this to grow, as you can see from the number of launches you see in the news every other week now. So it's a good growth market. We are excited about it. We have some great tremendous solutions over a year and that really positioned us extremely well and the U.S. market is growing leaps and bounds. On Helium itself, as you know, Helium is short. There are two major components at the moment kind of driving that. There is BLM in the U.S., which has the most significant impact. And most people were banking on some helium coming out of Amur in Russia. And we recognize that, that's going to be delayed. So it's likely for the rest of this year. I expect helium to remain quite tight. We're obviously seeing that incremental costs and pricing reflect a lot of that as we speak.  So from our perspective, we didn't have any Russian helium in our sourcing last year. We have a good balance of sources across the world, multiple sources to exactly manage these kinds of issues that ultimately come up. So managing dozens of sources, ensuring that we kind of mitigate that risk and meeting our customers' needs is really kind of where helium is at, and we're seeing pricing trends hold up. I expect that to hold up for the rest of the year as well, given the tightness in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale. Please go ahead. 
Peter Clark: Hi, guys. Good morning everyone. First one for Matt, actually. You made a very good point about the sell-off that Linde seems to suffer much smaller than its closest peer. It tends to be in the first quarter of the year. Obviously, that creates the opportunity for the share buybacks. And you've always made it clear when there's a correction in the share price, you go in big. You could certainly argue the share price remains depressed. You've been big entering Q2. I assume the pace of share buybacks is going to continue at quite a pace unless the shares correct upwards? That's the first question.
Matthew White: Peter, sure. So I can say we have very healthy cash flow. As you know, we follow our very disciplined capital allocation policy, which, to repeat for those on the call, is we have a mandate to maintain an A, raise the dividend. Our priority is to invest in the business and all the excess cash goes to our buybacks. And right now, we still have a lot of excess cash. We expect a lot of excess cash and we have the $10 billion authorization program.  So to your point, we did about $1.7 billion or so in Q1. We are in blackout right now into the 10b5-1 just given we are into the earnings. We'll be active again come Monday. And yes, we will continue to sweep excess cash to the buybacks and we see that as a great opportunity right now, frankly, based on the pricing. So we will be active, and we will be in the market every day. 
Peter Clark: Excellent. One for you, Sanjiv. On Europe, I think you made the comment, you're surprised it held up so well, I think, in terms of the activity, maybe, I don't know. But I mean, certainly, one of your peers pointed to the bulk gas is starting to get sluggish through the quarter. I'm just wondering your thoughts on Europe, particularly when I look at Balkans [ph], I guess your merchant pricing must be something like 20% now as you pass on this energy surge. Just wondering how you feel about the demand outlook in Europe, particularly? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Peter. So that is the point I was making, that I was really pleased to see how resilient the merchants, i.e., the bulk and the package side of the business has been right through the first quarter despite the fact that we had to put significant price increases through as a result of the energy cost increase that we saw.  So that's held up reasonably well, Peter, I'm hesitant to try and speculate what that market might do. There are, of course, a number of variables in that market. But I was surprised pleasantly that it had held and been quite resilient. And I have to say that as we move beyond the first quarter, that trend hasn't changed in any significant way thus far.
Peter Clark: Excellent. So there's no evidence of demand disruption at this point on pricing or anything like that?
Sanjiv Lamba: All I look at is a volume trend line at the moment, Peter, and that's not suggesting that for now. 
Peter Clark: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. 
John McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sanjiv, so early in your remarks, you kind of highlighted on Slide 3, the various business segments. And you mentioned healthcare was arguably maybe hesitate to quite put it this way, but over-earning just given COVID and that might -- that's come off a bit and it may continue. It sounds like to come off at least a little bit.  Can you help us to understand in terms of the other major end markets that you serve, where they are relative to kind of the pre-COVID levels in terms of volumes? Are there some that are still kind of noticeably below? I think you indicated Food & Beverage was seeing a nice recovery not quite sure if that's back to normal yet or not. But maybe you can give us some color as to relative to kind of normal expectations or normal volumes where each of those businesses are at this point?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, John. So let me first clarify health care, and then let me talk about some of the other end markets as well. So on health care, we saw the trend was flat. And really, what I was emphasizing was in the developed countries I'm finding that elective surgeries are increasing. As you know, these have been kind of put on hold through the COVID period. They are all coming back. That's where a lot of the oxygen usage is there.  And then we're finding COVID volumes offsetting by declining, particularly in the emerging markets. So that trend is why we are seeing the flattish kind of volume around the healthcare piece. And I said earlier, I expect healthcare will be back at its kind of long-term trend of mid-single digit in due course. Coming back to your other question around pre-COVID levels versus where we are on all our end markets. And I'll say to you more broadly, most end markets across most geographies are at or above pre-COVID level. So we've seen good recovery. We've seen that embedded in those different markets. And we've been quite pleased to see that recovery. You saw most of that in 2021 as well. And clearly, the momentum, as you can see from that Slide 3 that I put up, there's a lot of green on that slide, which is a good sign, as you can see.  So if I kind of maybe pick up a couple. Electronics, no need to comment on that. As you know, it's well above pre-COVID levels and has been highly resilient and continues to grow. And as I said earlier, I expect that growth to continue. Momentum around investments is still there, and we are winning more than our fair share of that. So I feel good about that. The ones that I think people kind of are watching carefully, chemicals and energy, again, very strong market movement over here. We are finding that 17% year-on-year growth, pretty solid number out there, John. But also, as I think about our footprint in the U.S. and just to emphasize this, this is where I see the growth going to be as we go forward.  That is crucial because the U.S. refiners and the U.S. chemical companies have a natural advantage from competitive natural gas pricing that gives them that ability to export into market elsewhere, where that energy price increases make local production a lot less competitive. And I expect that momentum to continue in the mid- to -- so I'll say next 2 to 5 years, if you will. Metals & Mining, again, impacted really around the Chinese curtailments, the dual control policy, et cetera, which is helping the rest of the world pick production up. And again, I am seeing continued investment in that space. We will see some decarbonization efforts happen in that space as well, which will provide a different kind of growth for us. But notwithstanding that, again, we expect to see that continue.  Manufacturing is where a lot of people have questions, obviously, supply chain challenges, chip shortages for auto, et cetera. And again, the underlying growth over there, the underlying demand looks solid, and we feel good about where that stands today. Obviously, we'll have to watch carefully how IP develops, and that's going to kind of be driven in part by how manufacturing continues to demonstrate that resilience.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Definitely helps. 
Operator: And we'll now take our last question today from Mike [indiscernible] from Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst : Just one for me, a question for Sanjiv. I just wanted to ask on the 300 or so unique carbonization projects you're looking at. I think last quarter, you sized the probability adjusted investment potential at around $4 billion or so. And then today, I believe you said $5 billion. So just really -- just trying to get a sense, are there more projects you're looking at now? Are you just getting more confident in some of these projects actually getting to realization?
Sanjiv Lamba: Mike, the number of projects that held around 300 that I spoke about last quarter as well. What tends to happen is really the portfolio of projects churn quite a bit. As you would expect, and we are adding some larger projects. I'm really pleased that on the industrial side, I'm seeing a lot more activity. That's right in the wheelhouse. We are incumbent in many of those positions. We are working with existing customers and that really gives me a lot more confidence.  And as you know, we are very discerning around the projects that we want to do because we feel that we want to have an offtake or part of that kind of contractual positioning around clean energy, and then we need to have the ability to be able to serve that, whether it's blue or green from technologies that we can access easily and have a demonstrated operational capability on.  You put all of that together, that's kind of what's leading to that $5 billion number. I wouldn't read too much into $4 billion and $5 billion, to be honest. The absolute number is in 20s. We put a fairly stringent probably the adjustment to that portfolio to get to that five. It's likely more than 5, to be honest. And I feel good about the quality of projects we are seeing. And there is -- you're right in pointing out that there is a higher degree of certainty around those as we continue to work with our customers and partners on them. 
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. 
Operator: With this, I would like to hand the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Sergey thank you. Thank you, everyone, on line. Really appreciate it. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out. Have a great rest of your day. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-10 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde plc Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, Cristina. Good morning everyone and thank you for attending our 2021 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. And I’m joined this morning by Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Operating Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjay will provide some opening remarks, and then Matt will give an update on Linde’s fourth quarter financial performance and outlook, after which, we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning everyone. By all measures, 2021 was another successful year for Linde. Our employees around the world delivered strong financial results while exemplifying Linde’s core values every day. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank them for their tireless efforts to ensure safe, reliable and cost-effective supply of critical products and services to our customers. Slide 3 provides full year highlights by four key areas of focus. Of course, this list is not exhaustive. There are many more we manage every day. However, these represent the overarching priorities that I view is important to our continuing success. So let me begin with our shareholders. This year, we once again delivered industry-leading performance. That makes it the third year in a row since our merger. EPS grew 30%. Operating cash flows expanded 31% and ROC increased to 17.7%, with all three metrics reaching record levels. And it’s important to remember, we achieved these numbers from a very strong 2020 base, which also grew double-digit percent from 2019. We clearly demonstrated the resilience of our business in 2020 and the ability to leverage the economic recovery in 2021. We shared the success with our owners by distributing $7 billion in the form of dividends and stock repurchases, and I fully expect this trend to continue. This was all done while implementing an orderly CEO and Board share transition to ensure future performance without any disruption. In fact, we have positioned ourselves quite well for the future by winning high-quality opportunities that meet our disciplined investment criteria. 2021 ended with a record $13 billion of contractually secured backlog projects, including more than $1 billion for new semiconductor fabs with leading customers in the electronics end market. In addition to that, we made $2 billion of base CapEx investments, including a record 43 small on-site plants also with long-term contracts. And we have also committed close to $500 million in clean energy initiatives. Currently, we are reviewing roughly 300 decarbonization projects globally with probability adjusted add to more than $4 billion of potential investment opportunities. Of course, none of this is possible without the thousands of talented employees that run our businesses each day. We achieved best-in-class safety performance while improving gender diversity to 28%, well on track for our 30 by 30 goal. In addition, we improved on several other country-specific diversity goals to ensure we run and manage our businesses in a way that best reflects and supports the communities we live in. We are a very local business and it’s critical that we always strive to give back. In further support of that commitment, every Linde business contributed to the 400 community engagement projects executed around the wall. And all these actions were undertaken in another year of the pandemic with our teams providing reliable and uninterrupted supply of gases and services to our customers, including critical oxygen to millions of patients in hospitals and at their homes. Finally, we maintained a strong commitment towards sustainability by doubling down on our existing carbon intensity goals and announcing more ambitious, absolute emission reduction goals for 2035 and also a road map for climate neutrality by 2050. And while it’s happening to see independent recognition of our employees’ efforts in this area, including a few listed here from Dow Jones Sustainability and CDP, I know we can further improve. Overall, I’m proud of how the Linde team came together against several headwinds and delivered industry-leading performance once again. So as I sit here today, I’m more confident now than ever on our ability to deliver another record year in 2022. I’ll now hand over the call to Matt to walk you through the financial numbers. Matt?
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjeev. Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of the fourth quarter results. Sales of $8.3 billion were up 14% versus prior year and 8% sequentially. You can see the effects of cost pass-through at 6% and 3% versus last year and the third quarter. While this is the highest quarterly number, we’ve seen in over a decade, it demonstrates the strength of our contracts by protecting returns from higher energy costs. And remember, this has no impact to operating profit dollars, but will negatively affect operating margins since we gross up both sales and costs. As anticipated, engineering contributed a solid 3% growth on the strength of their record project backlog. This trend should continue in the foreseeable future as they work through their multiyear $10 billion sale of plant backlog. Excluding these items, organic sales increased 9% over last year and 2% sequentially from a combination of higher volume and price. The volume increase over 2020 was broad-based with one third coming from project start-ups and the remainder from base volume improvement across all end markets. Sequentially, volumes were flat as growth in Food and Beverage, and Energy and Chemicals were offset by lower metals and seasonal reductions in our Southern Hemisphere LPG business. Price increased 3% over prior year and 2% sequentially across all geographic segments, with the largest increase coming from EMEA due to greater inflationary pressures. We continue to experience some pricing lag for the merchant and packaged business. So, we fully expect strong pricing in Q1 and throughout 2022 to recover inflation. Note, actual merchant and packaged price increases are mid-single to low double-digit percent across all segments. Operating profit of $1.8 billion is up 14% from last year and 2% sequentially. Operating margins of 22.2% are flat with prior year, but down 140 basis points sequentially. There are three drivers currently having a negative effect on operating margins, of which two have a neutral to positive effect on operating profit dollars and the third is a temporary lag that will correct over the next few quarters. The first factor is, of course, cost pass-through. And as mentioned earlier, a 6% increase is the highest we’ve seen. This is a standard part of our contracts that has no effect on profit dollars, but had an unfavorable impact to operating margins of 120 and 70 basis points versus prior year and third quarter, respectively. The second factor relates to the Engineering segment becoming a larger part of the growth. This will improve profit dollars and cash growth, but has a negative effect on mix since this business has a different margin profile due to the lack of capital intensity. Finally, the last factor is because energy prices have increased faster than price actions in the merchant and packaged business. This pricing normally lags one to two quarters and the higher inflation in Q4 caused this to push out another quarter. You can see in the table what the gas segment margin trends look like, excluding cost pass-through impact, up quite nicely year-over-year and down slightly on a sequential basis from this lag effect. I fully expect we’ll recover this inflation with underlying margins expanding in 2022. EPS of $2.77 in was 20% above last year and 1% above the third quarter. We also included a full year summary on Appendix Slide 8, showing sales and EPS growth of 13% and 30%. To Sanjiv’s point, this growth rate comes off a 2020 base, which also performed quite well. Full year and Q4 2021 EPS increased from 2019 by 46% and 47%, respectively, which emphasizes the continued growth of our business through any scenario. In fact, the business is well-positioned to outperform in all economic cycles. Our portfolio has ample resilient market exposure for recessions like 2020. High quality cyclical customers across all supply modes for expansion periods, like 2021, significant sale of plant capabilities to immediately benefit from capital cycles like we’re seeing today and sale of gas expertise, which has delayed capital cycle benefits, two to three years down the road. Simply stated, the Linde model can deliver leading performance regardless of the macroeconomic climate. The last point I’d like to make on this slide relates to capital management. You can see that ROC, which we view as the single most important metric for this industry, reached a new record of 17.7%. This doesn’t just happen overnight. It takes considerable effort from thousands of our employees to continuously deliver industry-leading profit and cash growth underpinned by a disciplined and consistent capital allocation process. And a big part of that effort went toward delivering the record operating cash flow of $3.2 billion, which is covered in more detail on Slide 5. The left side shows our quarterly operating cash flow trend. You can see that cash has increased each quarter for three straight years, and that 2021 was a record by growing 31% over prior year. The operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio reached 96% for full year 2021, well above historical levels. Part of this is driven by project prepayments in the $1.3 billion inflow of contract assets and liabilities, which is the accounting term to describe working capital for the engineering business. As stated before, engineering is a strong cash-generating business that delivers returns well within our investment criteria. These prepayments are from the record project backlog, which will benefit the income statement over the next three to four years. Due to timing effects, I expect 2022 contract assets and liabilities to be substantially lower than the 2021 level, but we still anticipate strong cash performance across the rest of the business units. Overall, I expect ongoing operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios in the low to mid-80% range. The right side shows how we deploy the $10 billion of full year cash flow. One-third was invested back into the business in the form of contractually secured growth projects and base CapEx, which represents both growth and maintenance investments. While a substantial portion of our business including packaged gases, health care services and engineering don’t require much CapEx to grow, so this only represents a portion of the future growth potential. In addition, we returned two-third or $7 billion back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our January 2021 share repurchase program of $5 billion is substantially complete, and we will review the future capital allocation in our upcoming Board meeting in two weeks. Overall, strong cash contribution from all business units enabled Linde to invest for future growth, while rewarding shareholders. I’ll wrap up with guidance on Slide 6. First quarter guidance is in the range of $2.70 to $2.80, up 8% to 12% from prior year or 11% to 15% when adjusting for the assumed 3% currency headwind. Sequentially versus Q4, this range assumes flat economic conditions with seasonally lower volumes, offset by higher inflation recovery. Q1 is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year, including for cash flow due to payment timing. Full year 2022 guidance is $11.55 to $11.85, representing an 8% to 11% increase versus 2021 and or 10% to 13% when adjusting for the 2% FX headwind. The midpoint of this range assumes flat economic conditions and thus, no base volume improvement. Consistent with our prior approach, this is not our economic forecast, rather, it merely represents the underlying assumption in the guidance range. You can insert your own view of the 2022 economy. And if it does better, I’d expect to be at the top end or above this range. And if we experience a recession, we’ll take actions to meet this commitment as we did in 2020. There remains a lot of uncertainty heading into 2022. And despite all the expert forecasts, nobody knows what will happen. However, we have an industry-leading business portfolio and contractually secured project backlog. So regardless of the economic challenges, we remain quite confident in our ability to continue delivering shareholder value. I’d now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I’d like to drill in a little bit on your engineering business. You had this kind of pop in revenue in the fourth quarter, and you have had this sale of plant chunk, the $6 billion project recently. But when you look over the last four years, revenue hasn’t changed much. Backlog hasn’t changed much, but your margins have doubled. Can you comment on what have you done to do that? Is that just productivity? Or is this a mix shift? And how has your view of the value of this business and the benefit to the broader operating units change since the last few years.
Sanjiv Lamba: Steve, I’ll let Matt take that question, and then I’ll add on to that.
Matt White: Sure. Hi Steve, so first, on your question on the history, the backlog on the third-party actually has declined if you go back a couple of years or the last year or so. But the margins have been able to maintain quite well because recall, we showed the segment of the third-party business. In addition, the engineering organization also works on our intercompany sale of gas backlog. They have the ability to gain absorption of the labor and build that and our sale of gas backlog that they support and perform will be part of the CapEx of the organization and the sale of plant backlog that they perform and execute become third-party sales and profits for the organization. So this was what something – as you probably know, we talked about even at the merger time, this combination of the companies bringing all of the opportunities, both sale of plant and sale of gas not only give our engineering organization a good backlog to work with, but also really helps with their very strong technical capabilities across growing in both areas. Now when you think about looking forward, I think the simple way to think about how to model this business, the sale of plant third-party backlog is translated dollar for dollar. So our sale of plant backlog is $1 backlog equals $1 of sales in the future. And as you probably know, the sale of gas backlog is $1 of CapEx. So it has a different ratio to sales. So for the engineering business, about a $10 billion backlog means we will get about $10 billion of future sales, and it’s usually over three to four years on how that’s recognized. And from a margin perspective, as long as they continue to have a good backlog of both third-party and sale of gas, it will allow them to efficiently manage their costs and obviously leveraging our global footprint in terms of what the hourly rates are. So hopefully, that answers your question.
Sanjiv Lamba: Let me just add on to that a little bit, Steve, in terms of how we see that business. So there are a couple of things that the engineering business allows us to do on the gas side as well, which make it quite unique and important for us. One is early insight into projects. So when one of our customers is looking at a large project, they will reach out to the engineering team and get some inputs. We get very early insight into that and obviously are able to leverage that. Now the next step from that is our ability then to be able to say whether we want a particular project to go down the sale of gas or a sale of plant option. And again, that optionality is something that comes intrinsically by having the engineering in-house. And last but not least, it is really a competitive advantage as we look at the transition that’s going to happen with clean energy. There is a whole new market opening up. And of course, right in the heart of that is technology, which is owned and proprietary to Linde Engineering and their ability to take other technologies and build them into solutions that will hold us in good stead as we look ahead.
Steve Byrne: Thank you for that. And one – quick one on your European business. Can you provide a split on revenue between on-site and merchants and cash? And the sequential price/mix increase of 4%, were you aggressive about pushing through price early in the quarter in order to achieve the results we did?
Sanjiv Lamba: Right, Steve. So the split roughly around the EMEA business, which kind of spans about 40 countries, but that split is roughly about third, two-thirds. A third of on-site whereas you know well, the pass-through kind of goes automatically from the contractual structures we have and about two-thirds of merchant and packaged, where, again, a lot of hardware goes in. And to your point, we’ve been – you might recall, Steve, that sort of about four quarters now, we’ve been talking about inflation. It isn’t new. And while it’s not well recognized, I thought it’s worthy of just a quick reminder. We operate in about 100 countries. Some of the best businesses that we have in many parts of the world, including Latin America, Asia and Europe, have been actively managing inflation over decades. It is not new to us. It’s a muscle that we flex from time to time, and it’s part of our performance culture, kind of getting into the details, digging in and showing we’re executing on pricing and productivity actions day in, day out. So that’s what the guys have been doing over there. We kind of treated as part of our ongoing business process, and they run that every day in that quarter. It isn’t something that we do at the end of the quarter or at the beginning of the quarter.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Good morning, Sanjiv and Matt. You just talked about your 300 decarbonization projects, you said potential of $4 billion in pipeline. How advanced are these projects? And when do they – when are they likely to get added to the backlog?
Sanjiv Lamba: Right, P.J. Thanks for that question. So obviously, we are very excited seeing the number of projects, the momentum that’s building up around that. Very important to always remind ourselves that these projects have long lead time and development. And we are seeing that on any major project, of course, even more so on some of these clean energy projects. Typically, these projects are divided into three – we kind of categorize them into three headings, if you will. There are a number of projects around mobility. You read about them every day. And many of these projects, of course, they are smaller in size relative to the other two segments, but many of these progressing at different paces. Large numbers in green, but a number of blue projects linked to mobility as well. The second bucket is really around industrial applications. This is where we are seeing either incumbent customers or new customers, look at blue hydrogen, green hydrogen, look at how they convert and decarbonize their own processes, whether it’s steel, chemicals, refining. It’s a long list. So all of those activities. Now being at the heart of that, and in most cases, incumbent in there, we are working actively with our customers to be able to help them understand their decarbonization strategy. And as a consequence of that, provide the input needed from our perspective to support that. The last segment is really where we are looking at the energy transition. So use of hydrogen in particular as an energy source, either through a carrier, so ammonia gets talked about a lot, or hydrogen by itself. And that’s a large segment, as you would expect, but is complex because it kind of has its own dynamic around larger. So as you’re dealing with kind of political structures and of course, a need for a global trade structure that allows for that distribution levels to happen. So we see development in all of these three. I think those 300 projects kind of fall neatly into there. And again, I have to say that while momentum is building up, and of course, you’re reading lots of announcements every other day, I know. I do, too. But I don’t really see many of those announcements translate into projects immediately. There is a lead time to that development. Do I see that the $4 billion that you referenced? Now remember, that $4 billion is probability adjusted. I mean if I was to open up the Pandora’s box and tell you what the absolute value is, we are talking $20-plus billion in terms of absolute value of those projects, but probably adjusted on a reasonably conservative lender basis, as you would expect, we think about $4 billion will come into kind of decisions, FID decisions for us in the next three years.
Matt White: And P.J., this is Matt. I may just add to that as well. Recall that our definition of project backlog is really the most stringent in the industry. So we have been executing right now some of those green projects as part of our base CapEx. If you noticed sequentially, it even it popped up here about $130 million, $140 million. So these are ones where we’re building density. These are ones where we’re converting to, say, blue or green on some existing hydrogen network. So they are happening. But to make our project backlog definition, it requires a very stringent approach, but we fully expect to see some there in the future, to Sanjiv’s point.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. And just a question on the flip side of the energy prices. So these high energy prices, does that accelerate your green blue hydrogen projects? And just with higher power costs, what is the cost of green hydrogen today? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: So P.J., that’s a fairly broad question. Let me just take a step back and mention something to you, which I think is important to remind everyone, which is that one of the areas around energy transition, and we are seeing a bit of pragmatism in Europe, as you know now, because the taxonomy is now describing both natural gas and nuclear as being in the green kind of zone, if you will. But one of the things to just remind us, natural gas will continue to be very important as we look ahead. So I see certainly momentum building up on natural gas, more investments, the capital cycle that Matt referenced in his comments earlier on, we see some of that playing out. And the projects that we are talking about in Linde Engineering as well, a lot of them serving that natural gas, growing natural gas business and development linked to that. So that is important just to recognize because we see that as part of the energy transition. You’ll see a role – a very important role that natural gas will play. Let me move on and talk about whether the energy costs are actually supporting this transition. And my view is, there are two transitions happening. I believe in the next decade or so, you will see scalable technology for blue hydrogen pickup now get applied now and actually create a transition to that ultimate greener energy transition that is often talked about. So I really see blue playing a big role. And really, the kind of power pricing that you referenced earlier on, doesn’t have a direct impact on that. And therefore, that momentum is on its own. On the green side, yes, as you see energy prices move up there is a bit of a challenge around that. And that will get factored in. Of course, all of this will normalize. The reality is what you see today isn’t what’s going to be for the next five years. So we should look at green hydrogen with that perspective. There is a lens of maybe a five to seven year development cycle, I’ve said this before. Our technology road map suggests that there’s a five to seven year cycle for that scale up to happen and for green hydrogen to stop, then still be at a premium, but a more acceptable premium to maybe blue as we look ahead.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Operator: We take our next question from Nicola Tang with BNP Paribas.
Nicola Tang: Hi, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the pricing dynamics. I think you mentioned that in your opening remarks that the cost inflationary pressure was bigger in Europe. So I was wondering why the sequential change in – or the sequential margin squeeze was actually larger in Americas than it was in Europe on an ex-cost pass-through basis. Is that to do with, I don’t know, Americas not being as effective at pricing? Or is it perhaps to do with the pricing dynamics in Lincare? And I guess, linked to that, could you talk a little bit about how the pricing dynamics in health care versus other industrial exposures and how the contract structures work? That’s the first one. Thank you.
Matt White: Hi, Nicola, it’s Matt. So first, we’ll start with saying there’s no structural concerns. I just want to make sure we’re aware of that and we understand that. And I think it’s important also to realize that – as you may recall in our last quarter, Europe right now is in the middle of some, we’ll call larger cost actions that they’re taking as well. And you remember, Americas and APAC had done those earlier. And we always said that EMEA would be a little later, and so they’re in the midst of those. So what you’re seeing in EMEA is a combination of, yes, higher inflation and pricing actions, but also in the middle of some cost actions that they’re taking, which will help the margin profile. In the Americas, I would not say there’s anything concerning or different. To your point, the health care profile on pricing will be different, right? That won’t price as fast to inflation. It tends to be a little more structured. Now that being said, at least in the U.S., they are getting a large inflationary price increase that will be effective here January 1. So that’s a normal part of the process. But I would say it’s more a function of how the cost actions are being taken in EMEA right now on a delayed basis, which is causing that.
Nicola Tang: All right. Thanks. And then just a quick one around volumes. It looks like all end markets were up sequentially apart from metals and mining. And I know it’s still a bit early in the year, but could you maybe give us a whistle stop tour of what you’re seeing so far across some of your key end markets? And I guess specifically comment on the metals and mining points.
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Nicola. Why don’t I do that? And what I’ll do is I’ll walk you through Q4 just to kind of build the base and then quickly talk about the outlook that we’re looking at. And I’ll talk specifically about metals and mining in China, as you know, that’s quite intrinsically linked. So let me start off with Americas as maybe the starting point. Overall, in Q4, you saw a strong growth about 7% up. It was pretty broad-based when I look at the market breakdown, metals, manufacturing, chemicals and refining, all cyclical end markets strongest. Followed, of course, by electronics and food and beverage, which also did quite well. And just very quickly, I’m going to cover refinery because I know a number of you are interested in that. Our refinery volumes are up higher than pre-COVID levels. Excluding start-ups, we are at about 15% up. Including startups, about 24% up when I look and compare the fourth quarter of 2019. Now sequentially, we saw chemicals and energy continue to be strong. Metals lagged a little bit in the Americas as well, largely as a result of customer turnarounds that happened in the last quarter. Manufacturing is slightly weaker, but that’s kind of what we typically expect in the third and fourth quarter. So nothing unexpected over there. The other way to look at the economy is what happens on the packet side of the business. And again, in the U.S. we saw good growth across all end markets, so which is really good to see. Both gases and hard goods saw double-digit year-on-year growth, pretty strong growth there. Sequentially, gases might have been about flat. Hard goods continue to grow. So again, that is good to see that. As I look ahead into the current quarter, I can tell you that we are seeing that fundamental demand stay strong. There are the supply chain challenges. And obviously, the inflation number that came out this morning will worry people, but we still see the underlying demand being pretty strong around the Americas and nothing that I can point out to that suggests any shift from what we’ve seen. Let me move on to EMEA and talk briefly. So again, broad-based growth in EMEA really led by industrials recovering metals manufacturing, high single-digit in Q4. We saw a nice recovery in food and beverage. I’ll thank everyone on the call who went out and bought a beer of pub because we were up 20% in the overall and in the UK in particular. So that is kind of good news. Sequentially, volumes are more or less flat, even though we had less work days in the quarter. And again, in EMEA, I see that trend holding for now. I can’t see anything other than some marginal adjustments on health care, where we had a bit of a spot in a few countries around medical oxygen, but we’re seeing elective surgeries pick up. So, I see a bit of offset in that coming into the Q1 as well. APAC, volumes up 7%, about what I’d expect, led really by electronics, chemicals and energy and manufacturing. This is where metals and minerals or mining for us was lower than last year. And as you heard the story before, curtailments in China, really the root cause of that. And again, sequentially, in APAC in Q4 as well, we saw they were about 2% down largely linked to metals and mining in China. Some customer turnarounds in chemicals as well. And then there was some seasonal adjustment for LNG – LPG volumes in South Pacific that kind of tends to happen every year. Just on China, again, recognizing that people are tracking this quite closely. If I look at January in particular and look at some data that we’re kind of tracking, I see steel a little bit holding back a little bit. I think in the first three weeks of January, it was down about 10% to 11%. The key production cuts and some constraints and curtailments that are in place, likely to be there till early March in provinces like Hebei, Tianjin, Beijing, Shandong, et cetera. After that, I expect that we’ll get back to last year levels, 2021 levels. And overall, for the year, I’d expect that we’d probably see something which is flat or slightly up. Also looking at, obviously, some of the Q1 numbers get adjusted for the Chinese New Year kind of impact. So, once we look at that, we find the other segments, electronics, holding its own pretty solid so far. Automobile production up a little bit, up about 6% of the first three weeks of January. Again, that’s a good signal. The last week of January, you have to ignore because that’s the week before Chinese New Year. So things start kind of shutting down, and that’s just a normal course of event. So, we’re watching closely to see what happens in China on the recovery next week onwards, that’s when the recovery post-CNY or post-Chinese New Year will happen. So we’ll kind of figure out how that plays out as we look ahead into the rest of the quarter.
Nicola Tang: That’s great. Thank you so much for the detail.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort: Thanks very much. Sanjiv, I want to go a little deeper on the pricing and the electricity and power costs in Europe. It seemed like there was quite a bit of investor consternation some market players were talking about four and fivefold increases in those costs. So, you guys did a remarkable job in the quarter. Do we have more to come? Is there a peak pinch point coming up in the first or second quarter? And then if you could, could you just talk about how you specifically introduce price through your three primary distribution methods? Thanks.
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. Thanks, Bob. So let me – maybe what I might do, Bob, is just take a step back and talk about inflation in general because it seems to be on everyone’s mind, talk about how we address inflation more broadly and then talk about the different supply modes and how we kind of work our way through that. So in gases, about 70% of our costs are really in three buckets: power natural gas the first, wages and distribution, the other two. Now really, energy cost increases are a part and parcel of the industrial gases business. I mean it’s something we manage every day. If power or natural gas costs go up, we make sure all our on-site contracts are passing that energy cost through. You can see that in our pass-through line, you see 6% year-on-year for the quarter, 3% sequential. And Matt said this earlier, it’s one of the highest in the decade. So that’s pretty high. But again, it’s part of kind of the norm of the business that we just run as we manage that on a day-to-day basis and pass it through. In parallel, our merchant and package businesses know what needs to be done. They’re out there in the field, pricing our products to cover these cost increases every day. There’s price escalation clauses, there are charges, surcharges, et cetera. So when you see that overall pricing line 3% year-on-year, 2% sequential, that kind of means merchant and package pricing is about double of that amount. I could tell you that across segments, I see a range somewhere from mid-single digits to low double-digit. Now clearly, not enough to cover the power inflation in the quarter itself, and we both referenced this in our remarks earlier. But we tend to have a lag of maybe one to two quarters to recover the full cost inflation. But you should know, we will continue to see pricing going forward, and we will recover that cost inflation as we’ve done over decades. So again, not something new. That’s kind of how we think about it. Wages is the other cost bucket I talked about. Something that we – I particularly keep a very close eye on and our team knows that productivity needs to offset cost inflation. I’m really pleased, and I’ve said this before with how we’ve embraced that productivity culture across this new merged organization, and I see progress in all fronts there. We allow this productive review in the next few weeks. I’m confident that the Linde employees across segments will have several hundred projects focused on efficiency focus on automation, leveraging technology to make our work streams even more efficient. So it’s an ongoing piece. It’s kind of in our DNA. It’s what we do and work through and wage inflation gets offset through a lot of activity that happens on the productivity side. Finally, distribution costs, I can’t say that we’re not seeing driver shortages and costs related to that. But I can also tell you that we have charges and surcharges in place today to mitigate that cost. Now more work needs to be done, clearly, particularly in hiring drivers, which is a bit of a challenge in the business but also in ensuring that each business is passing that cost inflation through. So again, all in, team is working to pass the cost inflation through. We currently see every element of that cost inflation is looked at by those teams, we reviewed at our GBRs every month. And they kind of do have done a fairly good job, but there’s more needed to offset the cost inflation in its entirety. And you should expect continued pricing and productivity to reflect that as we go forward. For the three different segments, I hope Bob I’ve given you enough color, but the on-site piece pass through it’s kind of direct action. On the merchant piece, there is a lot of work that happens on both the merchant and the package side, and we kind of leverage that on an ongoing basis. And again, going back into our history, if you go back, I don’t know, 20 years maybe, there’s never been negative pricing. We’ve always been pricing positive. And that’s just the way we run the business. And as I said earlier, managing cost inflation, energy cost increases in particular, part and parcel of an industrial gas business.
Bob Koort: That’s terrific. Very comprehensive, thanks Sanjiv .
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Good morning, gentlemen. First question, just around the guide, so $275 million, if you annualize I get to 11%, your midpoint is $0.70 higher than that. So can you just talk about as we go from Q1 through the next three quarters where that $0.70 comes from?
Matt White: Duffy, it’s Matt. First, as I mentioned in the pre-remarks, as you well know, Q1 is always our seasonally weakest just given some of the seasonality we see, whether it’s Chinese New Year, Brazilian Carnival, a lot of the events that happen in the first quarter. So you always have that component. Furthermore, our backlog is starting up. Our projects are contributing. They will continue to ramp forward and bring value. And we mentioned we still expect strong pricing throughout. So we fully feel good about that full year guide. We’re obviously giving our first quarter based on how we see the seasonality. I mean if you go back traditionally, Q4 to Q1, it’s usually flattish or even slightly down when you exclude things like FX. So I think you are seeing a little bit of improvement there. But as I mentioned, we’re taking a very neutral assumption on the macro and if we see some growth in the macro, that will be some upside to how we’re thinking about this. But right now, we feel quite good about that full year, and we should see some ramping and improvements in EPS, just given project contribution, pricing actions, cost actions, et cetera, as you normally see in a business like this.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks. And then could you talk a little bit more in depth about the health care business. How has it grown over the last year relative to the overall business? And more importantly, particularly like the home health care delivery business, how does it price, because as I recall, its mechanism is a little bit different with bids and stuff like that. So how does it price in a situation like this where you’ve got a lot of inflation?
Sanjiv Lamba: Duffy, I’ll kind of cover that as you kind of made the question in two parts, right? Let’s talk about the business that deals with the hospitals and where we supply products. And as you know, our teams did a fantastic job in the course of the year, making sure that very, very critical medical oxygen needs were met across the world. And that business – we said this before, we’ve seen those medical oxygen volumes start to trend down. We’ve seen normal elective surgeries trend back up, and we’re seeing that kind of offset each other and see our view of kind of long – mid to long-term growth in health care, mid-single digits. And we are seeing that business trend to that over that kind of horizon. You see about 3% growth year-on-year in the first quarter. So I don’t expect anything exceptional over there more broadly, but we do see that kind of trending to that mid-single-digit number. As far as home care is concerned, we, again, saw some peaks happen. And with the COVID infections going up, we saw oxygen pick up. When you think about volumes on the home care side that tends to get offset then because some of the other businesses that we have tend to kind of not get prescribed as much, and therefore, you see that offset in volume. We kind of saw that. We saw nothing unusual. We’ve kind of seen that for the pandemic right through, and we saw that right happen through this period as well. Again, just as a reminder, I think that business deals with maybe about 150,000 patients, if I’m not wrong, 150,000 patients that we supported through the pandemic, ensuring that home oxygen was available to them as they came out of critical care and so on and so forth. So again, a good way of just contributing to the fight against pandemic, if you will. Pricing on that, there is some history there, Duffy. But essentially, the CMS and a lot of the – basically, the – in the U.S., in particular, the agencies have recognized the critical need of that. And we haven’t seen that competitive bid piece play out in the last two or three years, more than that now – actually, three-years plus. And I think there is some degree of stability on pricing in there at the moment.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you guys.
Sanjiv Lamba: They do get an inflation adjustment that Matt pointed out earlier, Duffy, in case I have missed that.
Operator: We take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In one of your slides, you say that you’ve sourced more than 1/3 of your global electricity from low-carbon sources. Do your customers want you to do that? Do they want to pay a premium for electricity from low-carbon sources? And how do you manage the issue of passing through raw material costs if you’re accessing more from low carbon sources and that electricity is more expensive. How does that negotiation work with your customers? Can you expand on this?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure, Jeff. So this is something that we’ve been doing for some time, Jeff. So it’s not new. And there are various parts of the world where we have the ability to source renewable and low carbon energy and power, in particular, and we’ve been kind of doing that and passing those costs through. You’re right. In some markets, we are more advanced than others. The UK is a good example, parts of Europe, a good example, where these are well understood by the customers, and that pass-through mechanism has been built in around that, and they accept that. There’s a separate stream of green products that are now coming out. And again, we’re getting premium for that. This is a very small nascent market. So I’m not going to stress too much on it, other than to just tell you that there is a growing demand, small at the moment, but growing where our customers for their own requirements because they want to be able to certify their products – end products as being having a green component are seeking green products from us, which we are able to provide because of some of the sourcing that we do. And there, you do get some premium. Again, it’s not exorbitant, but there is some premium over a normal product that we’d be able to provide. Now as we go forward, a large number of customers across the world, in fact, are speaking to us about how green are we going to be longer term in terms of our power sourcing. And again, there are two components to that, Jeff, that we need to always remember. One is that the grid itself is greening and we do see that. And the other is how actively will we go and get renewable or low carbon power. And I think that’s – those are the two elements that actually bring up that number that you talked about, the third that we have today and growing. And again, as the grid green, there is a broader momentum around that. So that gets picked up and that’s kind of reflected in the grid pricing that comes through. And where we do active there, I think, clearly, we have a blended rate that goes to the customer and gets recovered. The only thing I can tell you is that today, we’re recovering fully on our energy costs and our power costs, even with this blend of 35% renewable and local.
Matt White: And Jeff, I would just add, when you think about low carbon, you have to think holistically. So while I know the first thing that comes to mind is always solar and wind, which clearly can be a little more expensive. You also have to think of hydro, right? In hydro power, we use extensively where we can. It tends to be lower cost power. And so by blending some of that hydro in and especially with some of the other new green opportunities, it can still give us a very attractive average cost of power.
Jeff Zekauskas: And then secondly, in the quarter, was there maybe $75 million or $100 million of increased energy costs that you weren’t able to recover from pricing that you expect to recover in the future? What’s your gap right now?
Sanjiv Lamba: Jeff, without getting to the numbers, the principle that I want to tell you is that we absolutely expect to recover the lag that we have from the previous quarter’s inflation that we’ve seen. And as a principle, you should expect that our pricing will ensure that, that lag is covered.
Jeff Zekauskas: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Take our next question from Peter Clark with Societe Generale.
Peter Clark: Hi. Yes. Good morning. The first one is on productivity actually. It never ends, of course. I saw on the APAC slide, it’s being stepped up, if I remember rightly, obviously, APAC started quite early after when the merger started. So just wondering what’s going on there? And then within Europe, you alluded to the fact, productivity, of course, is a help in the fourth quarter. Am I right in thinking there’s still a bit of positive momentum in Europe? So when we go maybe Q2, Q3, you get over the lag, you’re expecting a little bit of a margin bump coming through in EMEA? Thank you. That’s the first one.
Sanjiv Lamba: Why don’t I start with Europe first. So the answer is, yes, there is a lot of activity going – ongoing on productivity generally, but more importantly, in Europe, specifically in a number of high-cost countries. There is a specific cost program that the European business is pursuing. You saw us take a restructure charge. I think it was the quarter before, and that is going through. So that will have consequences, of course, positively so on the margin that you’ve just referenced. And as far as APAC is concerned, you’ve heard me say this before, a lot of the businesses in APAC kind of embraced that productivity piece and have built a lot of momentum around that. There is an active activity at the moment globally, but APAC kind of trying to take a bit of leadership on this around seeing that a significant portion of that productivity comes from digitalization efforts. We believe digitalization provides the right booster for our productivity at the moment. And again, I’ve set some internal goals that they are pursuing quite aggressively, and I’m pleased to see the progress they’re making on that.
Peter Clark: Okay. Thank you. And then Matt, you alluded to the fact the backlog is ramping up this year. I think you have the target now for the backlog providing mid-single digit to EPS. Just wondering if 2022 is going to be one of those years or the first years of that, and then potentially what that might mean for the topline kicker from that, because I think 2%, I think in the fourth quarter you alluded to. So presumably it’s going away 3% towards 4%, I don’t know? Thank you.
Matt White: Sure, Peter. And to your point, the 2% I alluded to would be specifically on the sale of gas because we were talking about the base volume. So when you think about the total backlog and totality of sale of plant plus sale of gas, you’re absolutely right, mid single digit is how we think about it, that’s clearly through 2022, and we can see that in several years out, just given the size of the backlog and the time to work it through. So we feel very good about that, and that’s something we reinforce and will be part of our continued performance and outlook.
Peter Clark: Good. And I am looking forward for the new share buyback. Thank you.
Matt White: So am I.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
Bhavesh Lodaya: Hi. Good morning Sanjiv and Matt. This is Bhavesh Lodaya on behalf of John. Thanks for all the color on the pricing and the inflation side. A quick follow-up on the volume side of things. Are you seeing any impact from the ongoing higher pricing either through demand destruction or just delays in the volume recovery in the economy? And is that something that could come back once prices moderate?
Sanjiv Lamba: So the simple answer to that Bhavesh is no. We are seeing underlying demand growth continue to be there. You saw that in the Americas, up 7%. You saw in APAC, up 7%. EMEA plus 2% and growing. So I can’t see, I can’t reference any demand disruption. I think we are on a solid kind of demand pattern at the moment. Impact really comes from supply chain issues and logistics and things like that.
Bhavesh Lodaya: Understood. Fair enough. And then looking at your backlog, so you’re clearly being very active in the semiconductor electronics space. Those customers are investing a lot in the capacity for multiple years now. Can you add some color as to how the electronics part of your backlog looks like now? And then how do you see the share of electronics as a percentage of your sales go from the 18% that you show right now?
Sanjiv Lamba: Absolutely. So it’s my favorite topic, so I’m glad you asked. So from a market perspective, I’d say it’s one of those end markets that I referenced earlier on saying that we won $1 billion of projects in the last year to serve top end customers, the top 1, 2, 3 in electronics to end markets with those wins. I’m also very pleased to say that I am confident that electronics will probably be the strongest growth contributor to our sale of gas backlog for the next couple of years at least, this year and maybe another two. So again, it’s an area that our technology and operating expertise carries a lot of weight. We have customer relationships that are very critical. It’s currently only 8% of our sales, Bhavesh, so not 18% but 8%, and I expect that to continue to grow, and I certainly see that at double digit.
Bhavesh Lodaya: Got it. Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. On the sales gas backlog at a high level, do you see this increasing over time? Or do you think it will stay in this roughly $3.5 billion plus range?
Sanjiv Lamba: Hey David. So the way I’m looking at the backlog, and I kind of referenced a little bit around what we saw on the electronics side and what we see happening there. I’ll talk a little more about proposal activity because that feeds into that question, but this is my view. We’ve got a backlog of about $3.5 billion at the moment. We have about $1 billion of start-ups this year, mostly at the back end second half of the year, if you will. So $1 billion of that is going to come out of the backlog, and I’m glad it does because that starts generating revenue and profits for us. I’m seeing a fair amount of proposal activity as we speak. And that really gives me some encouragement to say, I expect that we’ll fill that backlog either be at this level or maybe a little bit higher by the end of the year. Just where is that coming from? So we’re seeing strong electronics opportunity pipeline. And I fully expect, as I said in a minute ago, that electronics will continue to be a strong contributor to our SOG backlog for this year and a couple more. So that’s kind of a good starting point. Chemicals demand also remains reasonably strong. We kind of see some projects coming up in that space that are – in addition to our more traditional projects, we’re also seeing methanol and ammonia projects come up in that space. So again, seeing a number of companies evaluate, the investments in those segments. So happy to see that progressing as well. On refining, we’re seeing requests for blue and green hydrogen studies ramping up significantly. Customers are also reaching, obviously, how we can help them kind of capture carbon. And if we can provide some services around that. So again, we see some opening up there as well. And then I mentioned to you the 300-odd kind of decarbonization projects overall, if you will, all of which kind of look like they’re moving forward. Some of them will come for decisions into the backlog this year. But of course, they have their own lead times that kind of have to be worked through.
David Begleiter: Very great. And just back on health care, Sanjiv, anybody you parsed out the benefits from COVID this year that might not repeat next year or in 2022?
Sanjiv Lamba: David, the way I’m thinking about this is I am seeing that trend down for sure and we are seeing normal health care volumes. So what happened was in hospitals, in particular, all surgeries came to a stop and the hospitals got dedicated or really primarily served COVID patients. As COVID infections and hospitalizations in particular, are going down, there are a number of very critical elective surgeries that have been postponed, which are now coming back and which need oxygen for their procedures. So we’re seeing that ramp back up. And that’s probably the best way to think about that, where we’re seeing that offset intrinsically in the health care volumes by itself.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. I have two quick ones. Some of the questions assumed or implied that the pricing would catch up to the cost gap in – within a quarter or two. I just want to clarify, is that true? Or do you think it would take longer than that? And secondly, as you look at the longer term with the energy transition and the uncertainty around the industrial architecture and how that might be rearranged, does that affect at all your interest in doing larger kind of portfolio optimization, streamlining the number of countries you’re operating in?
Sanjiv Lamba: Hey, Laurence. So the simple answer to pricing is that whatever gap there is, we will recover that. So that’s kind of how we operate and look at this, and there is no gap at the end of that process. And hopefully, that helps. Talking about energy transition and industrial architect, it’s a great question. It merits a longer discussion. But in a nutshell, the way I describe it to you is, we think of the energy transition, and we see opportunity arise as a result of that, and we’re seeing that either through the blue ammonia, blue hydrogen route in due course, developments around green hydrogen, green ammonia as well. And we’re seeing different industries open up and different opportunities open up as a consequence of that transition. Coming to the portfolio rationalization piece, we kind of look at that anyway, irrespective of the energy transition. If there is some overlap there, obviously, that will get factored in. But irrespective of that, we kind of constantly look at our portfolio to try and understand positions that we feel give us the leverage that we want and look at. And you’ve seen that strategy being executed over the last year where we’ve exited a number of businesses, but also we’ve bought out minority shareholders in others where we know that we are able to do a better job and we can focus the team to kind of deliver on what it needs to deliver rather than get distracted by listing requirements. So all of that kind of plays in every day as our kind of strategy gets executed on that.
Laurence Alexander: Yep. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today’s question-and-answer session. Mr. Pelaez, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: We’re seeing a nice job, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today’s call. If you have any further questions, you know where to reach me. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Linde plc, Third Quarter 2021 earnings teleconference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today. Today's conference is being recorded after the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Juan Pelaez, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our 2021 Third Quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer, Matt White, Chief Financial Officer, and Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Operating Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.  The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Steve will provide some opening remarks, and then Sanjiv and Matt will give an update on Linde's business outlook and third quarter performance, after which we will wrap up with Q&A. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Angel: Thanks, Ron and good morning, everyone. Linde employees delivered another solid quarter, continuing Q2's record EPS performance despite increasingly challenging market conditions. Operating cash flow and return on capital reached record levels. and our project backlog nearly doubled, providing a strong foundation for high quality long-term growth. We also stepped up our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gases emission's footprint, and Sanjiv will share that roadmap with you. But frankly, this isn't something new, it's what we committed to our shareholders since the merger, and have been delivering on ever since, irrespective of the macro environment.  Most of you know this, but I think it bears repeating; our operating culture runs deep at Linde. Our people take great pride in demonstrating continuous improvement across the key operating metrics in their business. The best day of the month for our management team is when we review the operating performance of each of our regional business units. This is what we do for fun in Dan Berry, among other things. I'm sure you've seen the announcement earlier this week where I will become the Chairman of the Board and Sanjiv will become CEO effective March 1st.. This appointment is the combination of a diligent three-years succession planning process in which Sanjiv clearly demonstrated he was the right choice to lead this Company going forward.  I will continue to work to provide guidance both from the perspective of a director and a significant shareholder. But my primary responsibility shifts to chairing the Board of Directors while Sanjiv takes over day-to-day management of the Company. Supporting Sanjiv is a highly capable and experienced leadership team. I have been CEO for 15 years, and I have never felt better about how the Company is positioned. Obviously, our strategy is working well, and the team is executing at a high level. Some say we are a well oiled machine, I wouldn't disagree. We are a Company for all seasons and I'm confident Linde's best days lie ahead.  Before handing off to Sanjiv, I would like to take a moment and thank [Indiscernible] for his partnership in bringing our highly successful merger to fruition; and our directors and investors for their continuing support. Lastly, I want to thank our employees worldwide, for creating the leading industrial gases and engineering Company in the world. I will now hand the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you, Steve. I'm honored to be given the opportunity to lead this outstanding Company into the future. I appreciate your confidence and support over the years. Before I jump into the slides, I wanted to build on Steve 's comment of a seamless leadership transition. Here at Linde, we are proud of our industry-leading performance which starts with living our core values while maintaining a disciplined execution culture. As CEO, I fully intend to build upon our foundation. My focus will be on areas that are aligned with the interest of our shareholders; profitable growth, optimize the business, cash-generation, and of course, the truth serum for our industry, ROC. Linde will remain focused on the things that create value for Linde owners such as strong pricing and productivity culture and active commitment to sustainability.  A disciplined investment philosophy, a shareholder-friendly capital policy, and of course, pursuing high-quality and sustainable growth initiatives with emphasis on ROC. Ultimately, it's about being the best performing industrial gases and engineering Company in the world. This is differently, you can expect a seamless transition with minimal change. Now with that said, let's move on to Slide 3 for an update on our growth initiative. Last quarter, I mentioned some key growth drivers including the secure project backlog, a creative base capex investments, and the strength of our growth in low capital intensity areas such as healthcare, food and beverage, engineering, and our packaged gas business.  Today, I'm happy to report that our project backlog has increased from $7.5 billion to $13.4 billion or up 81% sequentially from the last quarter. You will recall this backlog only includes contractually secured incremental growth with fixed payments to ensure target and returns. We're also beginning to see a return of the capital cycle, especially in upstream operation such as natural gas production, that bodes well for our overall pipeline of opportunities. On top of that, the electronic sector continues to be very active. We recently announced a $600 million investment -- sale of gas investment indeed, to supply a world-class [Indiscernible] in Phoenix, Arizona.  This is supply only the first phase of this project, and we expect to see further opportunities as that area builds out. Overall, I'm pleased to see how the entire Linde team has come together and is leveraging our combined strengths to secure high-quality growth opportunities, through our leading high density industrial gas network, combined with the world-class engineering capabilities. This backlog, combined with our supply network density, enables profitable and secured growth for years to come. Now, before moving to the quarterly results, I want to update you on Linde's new and more ambitious greenhouse gas emission goals.  A good way to start this, is to first explain the roll our products play in people's lives, and the overall economy. You will find this on Slide 4. We make products that are critical for society. Products such as medical oxygen for hospitals, ultra high purity nitrogen for semiconductors, liquid nitrogen for food-freezing, krypton to insulate windows, and hydrogen to produce cleaner fuels, to give you just a few examples. In order to make these products, we expect to have a total of 39 million metric tons of scope 1 and scope 2 emission's this year. As you know, the production of gases requires significant amounts of electricity. When such electricity is generated using hydrocarbons, we're penalized for those indirect emissions called Scope 2 emissions.  We also have Scope 1 emissions, which are significantly lower than our Scope 2 emissions, but are significant nonetheless. And these emissions are largely as a result of using natural gas to make hydrogen, which is used by refiners to produce cleaner fuels. Our gases play a critical role in the economy. In addition to saving lives, improving energy efficiency, increasing shelf life, our products also help our customers eliminate or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, we generated a total of 37 million metric tons of emissions to make products that helped our customers avoid more than twice our emissions or 85 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. In other words, without Linde's products there would be significantly higher net carbon emissions in our world.  At Linde, we have been doing our part to support our planet for many decades, but we know we need to do more. In 2019, we set a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of Linde, 35% by 2028. We are well ahead of that goal and expect to exceed it, which is of course good news. But an intensity goal doesn't fully address the absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We are determined to continue on our mission of making our world's more productive, enabling our customers to de -carbonize and commit to reducing our own carbon footprint. With that in mind, I'd like to announce Linde's new medium and long-term emission goals, which you will find on Slide 5.  The first goal is to achieve a 35% reduction in our scope one and scope two emissions by the year 2035, or simply 35 by 35. To achieve this goal, we must materially reduced our scope on emission's, which are driven by hydrogen production. We will do this by focusing our efforts on carbon capture and sequestration, developing blue and green hydrogen production, and progressively transitioning to a zero emission fleet. Our scope to emissions are related to electricity consumption. Today, we consume approximately 45 terawatt hours of power, a third of which is from renewable and low carbon sources. In order to achieve the 35 by 35 goal, we will triple our renewable and low carbon power sourcing by 2035 through new PPAs and by supporting renewable energy projects with off-take agreements and even co-investments. To put this goal in perspective, the amount of renewable energy we will plan to purchase is equivalent of all the power consumed annually in New York City.  That's a big number. Of course, in addition to that, we will continue improving the energy efficiency of our plants as well. These goals are being embedded across the entire global organization being reviewed as part of our operating rhythm and will be incorporated into our annual variable compensation. This is what gives me the confidence in our ability to deliver these goals, which is no different than how we would approach anything of importance in our Company. Now, in addition to the 35 by 35 goal, we are also committed to pursuing our goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050. We will do our part to achieve this goal, but we also need strong policy support and regulatory support. Let me summarize this journey on Slide 6. We have defined a roadmap to reach climate neutrality. The roadmap is underpinned by numerous initiatives and milestones, which will be embedded into our operating system, providing us the greatest opportunity for success. Going forward, we will continue to share our progress and showing accountability and transparency for our stakeholders. I'll now turn it over to Matt to walk you through the numbers.
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 7 for an overview of the third quarter results. Sales of $7.7 billion increased 12% over last year and 1% from the second quarter. Cost pass-through, which represents the contractual billing of energy cost variances, primarily in the OnSite business rose 3% over last year, and 2% sequentially. Recall that cost pass-through has no effect on profit dollars, but will impact profit margins as we grows up or down sales and variable cost. Foreign exchange was a 2% tailwind versus prior year, but a 1% headwind sequentially, as most currencies have recently devalued against the U.S. dollar. Excluding these items, underlying sales grew 11% over prior year and 1% sequentially.  The 8% volume increase over last year was broad-based across all geographies and end markets as we continue to see recovery from the pandemic. Sequentially, volumes are flat as contribution from project start-ups were mostly offset by lower volumes in China. Pricing levels are up 3% from last year and 1% from the second quarter, as we continue to adjust merchant and packaged gas product pricing in line with local inflation. Note that some of these contracts have lagging recovery mechanisms, which may not take effect for 2 to 6 months, depending upon the terms and conditions. Operating margin of 23.6% is a 150 basis points above 2020, but 60 basis points below the high mark set in the second quarter.  Excluding the impact of cost pass-through, operating margin would have increased 220 basis points above last year and had a negligible decline sequentially. As mentioned, merchant and package cost recovery can lag 1-2 quarters. So going forward, I expect continued pricing momentum. EPS of $2.73 is up 27% over last year from higher volumes and price over a relatively stable cost base. As both Steve and Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has a strong productivity culture, which enables consistent profit growth irrespective of the economic climate. This is also evident in the 16.7% return on capital, which represents another record as profit continues to grow double-digit percent over a flat capital base.  The reason we've been able to maintain such a steady capital base, is due to a combination of disciplined capital management and healthy cash-generation, which I'll cover on Slide 8. You can see it to the left, our operating cash progression, resulting in a record level of $2.6 billion in the third quarter. The three main drivers are stronger earnings, timing benefits from last quarter, and engineering contract prepayments. In light of the record sale of planned backlog, I anticipate further project prepayments into the next few quarters.  As far as how we allocated year-to-date cash, the pie chart to the right shows $2.3 billion invested into the business and $4.8 billion distributed back to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Note that investments exclude sale of plan since we are paid in advance for engineering projects, which means that we are committing much larger amounts towards contractually secured growth, than what's shown on this chart. In addition to generating significant surplus cash, we have access to very attractive capital through the debt markets. In September, we issued almost EUR2 billion at 5, 12 and 30-year maturities with all-in coupons of 0%, 0.38% and 1% respectively. Overall, the combination of excess cash generation and low cost incremental debt gives us a high degree of confidence to maintain shareholder-friendly allocation policies over the long term. I'll wrap things up with guidance on Slide 9. The fourth-quarter EPS guidance range of $2.60 to $2.70 is 13% to 17% above last year, and 38% to 43% above 2019. Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's important to distinguish true multiyear growth from mere recovery of 2020 recessionary conditions.  Versus the third quarter, this range represents a sequential decrease due to normal seasonal declines, plus an estimated 1% foreign currency headwind. Underlying volumes are assumed to be roughly in line with the third quarter. But if current conditions hold out, expect to be at the upper end of this range. This quarterly update results in a new full-year guidance of $10.52 to $10.62 cents, which represents a growth rate of 28% to 29% over 2020, and 43% to 45% over 2019. In summary, another solid quarter despite some challenging conditions. And regardless of the macro, we remain confident in Linde's ability to continue delivering industry leading performance. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. We will take our first question from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort: Good morning. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you guys could comment a little bit on hydrogen markets and your engagement there with customers and partners, how that may have evolved over the last several quarters. Maybe from the context from the outside just seems like there's a massive broadening participation as people start reaching for that opportunity. Just maybe give us some insights into how you've seen that evolving it, Linde. Thanks.
Steve Angel: Thank Bob. I'll take that very quickly. I agree with you that there has been significant and continuing momentum in the space and I'm very pleased to suggest that we are seeing a reflection of that in the activities that we are actively pursuing. I'll start off by just describing what the opportunity pipeline looks like because that's reflective of the level of activity that Linde is seeing, and then talk a little bit about the particular areas where we see some of that momentum reflected now. Starting off with the projects that we're looking at, as you know, we run this monthly call on the hydrogen council that Linde runs internally. We've got about 260 projects in our pipeline.  We've got a probability weighted -- a conservatively probability weighted number in terms of investment decisions of up to 4 -- 4+ billion now. And these are decisions we expect to see happen in the next 3 years or so. In the past, you've heard me say that we expect to see us investing about a billion a year, roughly in the space, and then on top of that, there may be some megaprojects that come along as well. So that's just to give you a sense of the level of activity that there is happening around that space. Now remember, and I've said this before, Bob, so you'll recall. Linde has a unique position in what is happening in the evolving space around clean energy. We've described to you previously, under de-carbonization, we look at carbon solutions and we look at hydrogen in the hydrogen space. We obviously are very mindful and interested in the developments around blue hydrogen. We see that as a very important transition in this clean energy road map that lies ahead. And this is where we're seeing significant pick up in terms of activity. We are currently involved in a number of projects which have a range of investments, and those are progressing well.  And again, for projects in the space to make sense, you need 3 things to be happening. You need the technology provider, in this case that is us for carbon capture. You need partnerships to ensure that you have been looking at sequestration effectively with partners who have longstanding experience and knowledge of that space. We're currently actively pursuing those as well. Of course, Todd, very importantly, you need an offtaker, you need a partner who is willing to stay in the game and actually off stake the blue hydrogen that comes off that and is able to create some value as a result of that.  For us those 3 things are very important. And again, I'm pleased to say that we are seeing those partnerships actually gather a lot of momentum as we move forward. I'll stop there for a moment and give you -- see if that answered your question.
Bob Koort: That's very helpful. What about the competitive intensity as that landscape has been populated with more and more companies, maybe trying to edge it on the turf that has historically belong to the industrial gas companies?
Steve Angel: So the way I'd answer that, I think Bob, is just to remind you a lot of -- so firstly, lots of announcements. I think you see them, we see them every day. And every morning I wake up to this long list of announcements that are happening. A large number of people who make those announcements have either never seen or heard of hydrogen before this. Most of them don't even understand that we have a colorless molecule that obviously is now defined by very, very many colors. But anyway putting that aside in terms of experience and expertise, the reality is, there will be a number of players who will make a difference in this space, and as part of that, you will see a range of outcomes. You will see us competing where we need to, and you will see us partnering with a number of those as well.
Sanjiv Lamba: This is an area that requires strong partnerships for that initial momentum and the ecosystem development to really happen. and I see that development happened where we are speaking to a range of partners across different areas helping move this along. I don't particularly see this as a space that you're going to see the intensity of competition being any different to what we see otherwise.
Bob Koort: Very helpful. Thanks, Sanjiv.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning. First, just want to say congrats to Sanjiv on great promotion and thank you to Steve for the decade and a half and from investor's standpoint, maybe even more in the way the transition was handled, almost picture perfect. Thank you, guys all for that. I guess my question is around Lincare and maybe the medical business in general. If you go back before COVID started in, just analyze how that business is developed with COVID as the driver, how do you see that business structurally different today and how much is it growing through that period relative to the rest of the business?
Sanjiv Lamba: Duffy, thanks. Let me get into it and I'll start off by just taking a step back and outlining the healthcare space that we operate in, and also reminding everyone that we have strong leadership in that space. We think of our healthcare business in two different areas: we look at hospital care, where we are the primary provider of medical gases to hospitals; and of course, a home care business, where as you referenced Lincare is a very, very important player in the U.S., but we obviously have smaller home care businesses elsewhere in the world as well. Thinking structurally above that business, let me just say to you, there are two things happening as we speak. Obviously, you've heard us talk about how we've -- how that businesses supported and save lives and supported hospitals and patients at home over the last 18 plus months now. So clearly, it's played a very important role, [Indiscernible] in particular, in the U.S. was almost seen as a second line of defense supporting COVID patients at home through the respiratory offerings that we have. What has happened as a consequence of the pandemic is that a number of regulators and governments have, in the best way to describe it, as woken up to the realities of how they need to manage this more professionally in terms of storage, in terms of piping, in terms of infrastructure necessary for these high levels of medical gases and oxygen in particular to be delivered to their infrastructure and network. We have been participating in many of those conversations. In fact, most governments have reached out to us seeking support and help in structuring those conversations. And we are obviously leading many of those conversations across the world today, where we are helping government and regulators make sure that they have a well thought through infrastructure program and a development process around how they will manage this this is going forward. A kind of pandemic preparedness a little bit late in the day but nonetheless important to make sure for the future. The reason I mentioned this is because this means, as we move forward, we are going to see continuing activity in the space. We will be participating in those activities and expecting a level of growth out of that. We've said this before, David you've heard us described mid-single-digit growth for our healthcare business overall. And I still maintain that we will see that obviously in the Lincare world in particular tuck-in acquisition of something that we are very interested in excited about.  We'll continue to see those come through, adding onto that mid-single-digit or contributing to that mid-single-digit that are referenced earlier on as well. I do see this a solid secular growth trend. I see it progressing with that strong mid-single-digit growth that I described earlier on. And I see us seeing areas in the world where we will see that probably grow -- not probably, we'll grow at a higher pace, Asia being one such example. Again, because of the strength of our footprint there, we have the ability to make sure that we leverage that footprint for that incremental growth in Asia as an example.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. And then maybe just a quick one. As we start to look into 2022, when you look at just a new project growth coming onstream, how will that impact 2022 relative to what we've seen over the last couple of years?
Sanjiv Lamba: All right. So I have to say I expected that question, so that's good. Now, allow me to take a bigger step back and just go back to what we said maybe a couple of earnings calls before. We committed to delivering a 10-plus percent EPS growth for the midterm. As you can imagine, I feel pretty confident about that today as I'm sitting here. It's obviously supported by this very strong backlog that you just referenced. I have to say that this strong backlog will provide us with mid-single-digit EPS growth, if you like, for the next 4 years or so. So that's a pretty strong contributor right there for you.  Now, on 2022 specifically, specifically, I'm going to say to you that in about 3 weeks time, we're going to spend 3 whole days with every region around the world going through our planning meeting. Steve mentioned to you how we had fun in Danbury, this is going to be one of those fun events. We will review, we'll dissect, we'll analyze their numbers, and then in the end we'll agree with them what they need to deliver for 2022. Some looking forward to coming back in January and giving you an update on the outlook and our guidance for 2022, once we've had this meeting.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Nicola Tang with Exane BNP Paribas.
Nicola Tang: Thanks, everyone. And congratulations to both Steve and Sanjiv. I first wanted to ask a question on China. I think Matt, in your prepared remarks, you talked about [Indiscernible] weakness in China. I was wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing on the ground there, in terms of direct and indirect impacts from energy control measures, I guess both in terms of today -- the impact today and in terms of -- with respect to future investment opportunities. And then the second question was on engineering. And congrats on this very big project. I think you used to talk about a mid or low to mid-teens through the cycle margin. But we've been tracking above that for some time now. I was wondering whether there's any reason to assume that this new business would be at a different margin to what we've been seeing in the recent past? Thanks a lot.
Juan Pelaez: Sure. Hi, Nicola. I can take this one. Starting with China, yes. To your point, we did see some volume curtailments as you would expect with the power outages. We do feel very confident about our customer base. They're still paying the m-tops. These are Tier 1 customers. This is something you've seen as you probably know in prior times in China, when there are some centrally managed slowdown. So from that perspective, yes, there were reductions on a sequential basis. Now, if you look at the APAC segment, you actually see volumes are up 2% sequentially. And the primary driver there is because our backlog pretty much offset any of that China sequential decline. And then the rest of our APAC business still performed quite well on growth, including some seasonal growth that we tend to see in the South Pacific. So from that perspective, yes, we had some of that. We anticipate a little bit of that to continue here into the fourth quarter. So when we talked about volumes assumed to be flat sequentially into our guidance range. It does take into account some continuing just volume softness based on this. But overall we feel very good about our asset base. We see this as temporary and to some extent, we tend to come out stronger on these things with our customer base, so we'll see how that plays out. And on the engineering, you're exactly right. We have been operating mid-teens or a little better, and as you can imagine, as you know, this business has pretty much a negative working capital. What you see on the margins can be a pretty good indication of the type of returns you get or can even be a little better just based on the cash profile. Very good business that we have, we're very excited to have this backlog. It will contribute to growth. We tend to focus more on the E&P side as well, which helps with the risk management. From this perspective, we still see margins in this, I'll call it, low to mid-teens and we'll see how it plays out though over the cycle. You will always have timing in how you recognize the percent completion. Quarter-to-quarter, it's always tough to gauge on any particular one, but over the multi-year process, we still think that low double-digit to mid-teens is still a reasonable estimate through this business as it goes through the cycles.
Nicola Tang: Thank you. And if I may ask a follow-up question around energy costs and not specifically related to China, but more globally. Obviously, with your business it's clear in terms of the pasteur effect or the [Indiscernible] pasteur effect. But I was wondering if you're seeing any impact on your customers deciding to idle or reduce production at their own facilities because of their own higher operating costs?
Matt White: Yes, sure. I can handle that one Nicola. As you could imagine on the onsite business, we have our fixed payments, whether it's a facility payment or an MTOP. So from that perspective, we tend not to really have much risk to the production volumes. Given that it's not really anything I would be overly concerned with. In fact, if anything, what we've seen, especially on our more industrial customers, they tend to run in harder. You could think steel, you could think refining, given the environment they're and the margins that they're making on some of these products as far as the merchant and realized the package, it's a high rent business, so the volatility of the customers demand will really only affect the gas molecules.  And what we're seeing, especially in Americas and parts of Europe still seeing pretty strong growth across that package business, so I think that's been quite good. But on the merchant side, now we really haven't seen any significant negative changes. It's been up pretty much across the board. And you can imagine, the customers want to produce. They want to make as much product as they can in this environment, given their opportunity to get some pricing. So from that perspective, we haven't seen any material effect on that. There may be some small pockets, but nothing that's coming up to the aggregate level.
Nicola Tang: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tony Jones with Redburn.
Tony Jones: Yes. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to come back on the margins. On an x cost pass-through basis, margins are up all regions in some cases materially. Just wanted to check whether there are any positives in there that we should be thinking about that could wither as we go into 2022. And we're getting now also to a stage where this is about as good as it gets. Thank you.
Matt White: You answer that.
Sanjiv Lamba: Yes, I can answer that. Tony that's, right. You can see the margins moving up experts through your nearer margins are up. And a strong showing by all the segments within that. I think we see that momentum or what we've been working on playing out in Q3. Now, I don't really -- as I mentioned earlier on, we're going into the spanning cycle on 2022. I have to say, one variables as we think about this is, how does inflation play out and how does -- how do energy cost play out in the year ahead. I don't really want to be forecasting that to be honest. But what I do want to give you is some assurance on the pricing which then clearly then flows into the margin piece and addresses your question, which is, you can expect us to always be keeping pace with inflation, global inflation. And that really is a reflection of how we will do that management around the pass-through elements in particular, and pricing beyond that. And that's what we'll then come back through the leverage we have down to the operating margin that you will see. So hopefully, you will come back and tell you in January what we think is the outlook for 2022 with a bit more precision. But for now, you can expect us to keep base on the pricing side with any cost inflation that we're seeing.
Steve Angel: Just to add a comment to what Sanjiv said, this is Steve. I think as we go forward, I don't like to ever hear the word peak margins because I don't -- never have believed in peak margins. And when we say our best days are ahead, you got to keep in mind that we are going through a period where there has been a tremendous amount of cost that came through the system, mostly in the form of power. If you were to look at EMEA, for example, costs increased 25% to 30% between Q2 and Q3. So that's a lot of cost that comes at you at once. We instantly passed that through as I mentioned on the on-site piece, but it takes a few months, up to 6 months to be able to recover all of that through the merchant and the package business.  But if you think going forward over time and you heard us describe this model before, we take the top line or we're able to leverage that through pricing and productivity to deliver increased EBITDA margins over the long term. And we've been able to do that for many years and that's really going to be the model that we will be in going forward especially as we clear this immediate wave of cost inflation that's coming through the system and we deal with that in a very positive way in the coming quarters.
Tony Jones: Thank you, that's really helpful. And if I could, just a small follow-up on the 35 by 35 targets. I appreciate that, also the update there. We've heard from some chemical companies that there's extra costs or CapEx required to get sustainability targets. Is that going to be the case for Linde? And maybe if so, you could help us think a bit about what that could look like. Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Tony, as we put those targets up and we've built a roadmap around that clearly, you would have seen in our description of how we want to achieve that. We are working -- Our mission here is to support our customers in that decarbonization attempt and ensuring that we have the technology and the solutions necessary for that. Now we make those commitments, keeping in mind the broader decarbonization trend that is happening. And of course in our support of that, we will need to make investments along the way, which we look at on a project-by-project basis. And each of those investments, we've said this previously, obviously need to live up to our investment criteria.  They will of course, be supported by incentives and carbon pricing carbon penalties, as the case might be, which actually makes that economic case necessary for that transition to successfully happen as we move forward. I fully expect us to see those economically feasible cases, workout. Ones that will actually have to meet our investment criteria as we support this broader transitions for our industry. As you know well, Tony, whatever we emit ourselves, is really there to ensure that we are helping our customers either abate, avoid, or completely eliminate emissions. And that goal continues to be what we'll focus on going forward.
Tony Jones: Thank you, that's great.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Peter Clark with Societe Generale.
Peter Clark: Yes. Thank you. Again, congratulations to Sanjiv and Steve for that one hell of a deal, and I guess the share price reflected the thought that went in the transition there. I've got 2 big picture questions really. Looking at the engineering backlog and the way it's grown, I think, Steve, you were commenting not so long ago that you saw a 50-50 as a very nice mix in terms of what was the internal, what was external. Obviously, if the cycle is picking up with schooling. Now, we're at 75, 25. Just your thoughts from that. I accept obviously, you're looking at your return criteria, etc. but just your thoughts on that as we go through the cycle. And the second one is your comments about best days ahead, hopefully. Obviously, return on capital now is 200 basis points above where [Indiscernible] were 10 years ago at the peak. Just wondering, your thoughts from a return on capital, obviously, a lot of momentum to support that, but how you see this on a structural basis as we move forward. How we [Indiscernible] hopefully higher now with all the benefits of the merger against what we thought we could get in gases prior to that? Those are my 2 questions. Thank you.
Steve Angel: Well, given I'm not going to be the CEO past March, first, I really don't want to provide too much long-range thinking about return on capital, but I think if you go back to what I said about being able to take growth converted to higher levels of profitability, good capital management, over the time we should be able to march the return on capital number up a little higher. With respect to the 50/50 comment, if you think about when we book -- [Indiscernible] gas projects, they typically are in the hundreds of millions of dollar range. If you look at the TSMC project, that's $600 million of capital investment, that would be tied for our largest with Samsung.  When we see [Indiscernible] gas it tends to be -- that's a very big project, and clearly, we land ed some very large projects, third-party projects with Linde Engineering. And that obviously, shifted the waiting in terms of whatever that is 75%, 80% of the total backlog is third-party sales and is driven by these very large projects. Matt alluded to this, these very large projects had very strong contractual terms. They are very high quality of contracts, I will say. We have cash flows that -- incoming cash flows that certainly are well ahead of our cost outlays as we work through these projects. So they're excellent projects and we're delighted to have them.
Peter Clark: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Looking at EMEA in Q3, can you quantify the amount power costs that were not passed through or re captured during the quarter?
Matt White: Yes. David, this is Matt. That's not a number we're going to provide publicly. But I think if you look at the sequential margin profile and you adjust for the stated cost pass-through that obviously associates itself with the on-site business, some of those differentials could -- of the remaining amount are things that we would want to be gone chasing related to some timing-related. And as you can imagine, EMEA has a much larger package and merchant percent than on-site. so that will also play into having a larger proportion of costs that need to be captured on a delay. And one thing I just want to be clear on is, this lag is normal.  This lag is inherent in the industry. We have faced this lag since our inception, going back decades. It just so happens in this particular quarter, the movement of the energy prices, the movement of some of these numbers are faster in a shorter time period. So given that, you're going to have some recovery, that'll be next quarter and the quarter after. But EMEA would be probably disproportionately larger than most other regions with that lag, just given the packaged and merchant exposure.
David Begleiter: Got it. And given that, would you expect price mix to accelerate further in Q4 from the 3% we had in Q3?
Matt White: As you could -- as I stated in the prepared remarks, yeah, we absolutely anticipate and expect the pricing momentum to continue and this is something that, as we go and recover this, that will play into it, so that's our expectation.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. The backlog and first sale of plant went up 6 billion sequentially. Can you talk about what it is that you're going to build? If you can talk about the customers that would be great if you can't. But how did it grow so much? And does that mean that your CapEx over magnitude is now going to be, I don't know, 5.5 billion higher than you thought over a number of years to execute that? And then lastly, so if you're getting, I don't know, 480 million into your Cash Flow Statement from prepayments, I take it that that then will -- you'll fund that with capital expenditures later on. So in a certain sense, your cash flow from operations is overstated. Can you talk about those issues?
Matt White: David, I could start with the cash and then -- and Sanjiv could talk about the backlog project itself. Just to make sure we level set and get the accounting correct. This is sale of plant, so this never touches CapEx. This is under percent completion accounting, so what happens is, the backlog that we have actually translates essentially one-to-one to sales, $1 backlog equals $1 of sales. And as we construct it, it goes to inventory, and then when we meet the criteria, it's released out of inventory to sales. Therefore, it never actually hits CapEx given the nature of how this structure works. And then as the prepayments come in, they sit on the balance sheet as a liability. And then, obviously, we work and deliver the performed work which then goes against that liability, to relieve that liability as we deliver.  So this is a classic percent completion accounting style. Given that, and maybe let's talk about the cash flow real quick. In this business, in this industry of engineering and percent completion. When you're in a declining backlog, what tends to happen is your cash outflows are obviously higher than your inflows because you are delivering on the work, the engineering, the procurement, and you basically think of a book-to-bill ratio. So as your book-to-bill ratio starts to drop, you're going to have more cash outflow than inflow. Now that trend has reversed. We've actually had more outflow than inflow over the last few quarters because we were building off a backlog that was shrinking. Now it has grown dramatically. That process is reversing.  As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a few quarters we expect some prepayments, given the size and increase of this. And then we'll work them down over the next several years as the outflows go. But you still have more backlog that if you win, it can mitigate that. So that's how to think about this, it's not in CapEx, that's why I said in prepared remarks, the growth that we have is much greater than what's being shown in CapEx because of this delivering. As Sanjiv had mentioned, we're going to be probably mid-single-digit in terms of our contribution. So hopefully, that makes sense, but I can hand it off to Sanjiv to talk about the project.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. Jeff, let me just talk through the project a little bit and give you a little bit of color on that. We have -- the 6 billion incremental two large wins that we're talking about are the reason why you're seeing this significant buildup in our backlog. We're very happy with these invests -- with these projects, I have to tell you. They are with a very high-quality customer. I am going to name the customer now just for you, which is Gazprom. It's a customer with whom we have excellent relationships. We have got great experience thus far. We've got solid contract terms which makes us pretty comfortable around taking on these large projects. Also as Matt referenced, strong cash flows. I want to remind you also that these cash flows tend to come in, the inflows are ahead of any commitments we make.  We tend to be net positive as far as our cash goals are concerned. And of course, it's in an area where we've got good experience of execution. Again, we put all of that together. That's the project. Now, what are we building? Let me just give you a little bit of color on that. We are building some GPPs, this are gas processing plants for Gazprom at the site, Ust-Luga and we're also building in a separate project also at that same-site, which is a separate win, but an important one also, is an LNG plant for them. I expect natural gas, developments will continue given the energy challenges that the world is seeing. And this is a major milestone as Gazprom have continued down the path of investing in that space.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. And then secondly, I think your cash balance was $4.7 billion. Is that too much? What should your normal cash balance be as you manage your cash flows.
Matt White: Yes. Jeff, I can answer that. When you're getting paid to take commercial paper 65 basis points, you do end up a little bit of a grossing up of your cash and your CP. So yeah, we're still getting paid up till 5 years on the curve with Europe, so our cash balances are swelling a little bit. Now those are U.S. dollar cash balances, so they are earning a return. But we're also earning a return on what we're borrowing. So at this point that is causing a bit of a swelling. But as you've seen, between our projects that we're undertaking, between some of the shareholder-friendly actions we're taking, we're going to keep working those cash balances down.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Geoff Haire with UBS.
Geoff Haire: Hi, thanks very much for the opportunity. I just want to ask a slightly longer-term question on maybe the Sanjiv. Obviously, the sustainability targets you've put out are great. But I think you did mention that to achieve the 30 by 35, you need government support. What happens if you don't get it? What can you do yourself without any government support, particularly thinking about green hydrogen, and other areas.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Jeff. It's a good question. I think that when you think about the sustainability targets that we've put out there, '35 -- by '35, there is -- you have to think about the framework within which this is happening. Clearly, there are activities that we can undertake and we are undertaking today which will continue to move in that direction. These are efficiency programs, this is about fleet replacement, etc. There are a number of initiatives that are ongoing and we'll continue to work towards which will execute towards that. But it's also correct to say that even today that our government initiatives -- the government incentives available, so we're not suggesting that there is a complete void over here and then we need to complete remake off that.  In the U.S., we have the 45-Q that is being effectively utilized to look at investment profiles like this. Now, I have to be honest and tell you that I'd much rather that 45-Q, which currently provides $45 to $50 per ton of CO2, be anywhere between $90 to $110 per CO2. That's where I would see the inflection point at which momentum for development of these projects would significantly ramp up because there had been economic case for it. In Europe, clearly there's the ETFs, the trading scheme that is currently valuing CO2 anywhere between EUR60 to EUR65 per ton. So again, as we see that move forward where there is a plan. Similarly in Canada and South Korea and in Australia.  I could name a number of countries where these incentives or penalties are coming into place today. So we are working in that environment. We think that more support is necessary, but there isn't a complete lack of support. So a number of our projects will be relying on the support infrastructure that's available through the incentives and penalties, to leverage off that to continue down the decarbonization trend. And of course, as we look longer-term to carbon neutrality, in our assumption when we think about our roadmap, clearly we've got some levels of support available. The range anywhere between $100-$200 per ton of CO2 in equivalents term, longer-term to make sure that we get to that level of climate neutrality that we're talking about as being the goal that we achieved by then.
Steve Angel: I'll just put a point on Sanjiv's excellent response to that. If you think about decarbonization and the cost of capturing and the cost of sequestration, it can vary $80 to 120, something like that. And to really tip the scales in terms of capital investment, to decarbonize you're going to need something like that in terms of a carbon price. Up until now the 45Q can work in certain projects, it's $50 the low carbon fuel standard California provide s some support too. But as we look forward to really make meaningful strides to decarbonization, you're going to need a stronger carbon price. That's our view.
Geoff Haire: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning. On your slide 18 or slide of blue hydrogen, is that where you're seeing some order activity today? And then looking at your joint venture with ITM in electrolyzers, how do you see blue verses green hydrogen backlog, let's say in the next 5 years? And your industrial customers wanting to go to blue hydrogen first before thinking about green hydrogen.
Sanjiv Lamba: P.J. the way I'm going to answer that question is to take you back a step and just remind you of some of the messaging that we provided in the previous earnings calls. So I've said before that when people think about what hydrogen is most appropriate, one of the things you have to think about is the strength individual countries have, the assets that they have. Where countries today have hydrocarbon assets, have natural gases as an asset, we firmly believe that they will pursue the part of blue hydrogen because that is the most meaningful -- that's the most meaningful way to move forward on this transition. The reason it's meaningful is because it's to scale, it can be done today and we're not waiting for technology developments to happen. And I'll talk about [Indiscernible] in a minute, but you'll hear me reflect that comment over there as well. The answer is where we see that natural gas resource available in the U.S., in Canada, Australia, Russia, Middle East, we believe -- we know that those countries are actively pursuing and we're looking at a number of counter-parties over there as partners, looking at some of those developments ourselves. And the Slide 18 gives you a sense that Linde Engineering 's technology portfolio allows us to be able to flex any technical solution. We are uniquely positioned to provide that technical solution for our blue hydrogen output whether it's using an SMR, whether it's using an ATR, or whether it's using gasifier. We have the ability and technology to both provide the technology packages, execute them, and operate them ourselves because of the expertise we have. That's as far as blue hydrogen is concerned and I do see a lot of momentum building up in that space and we are very active in that space as well. Let's talk about ITM and order of in taken backlog going forward. Now, you're asking me to project 5 years out. I have to tell you, the only thing I'm going to project 5 years out is to tell you that the technology roadmap that we have going with ITM through our joint venture with them is to make sure that that product scales up and that product then has the capital efficiency and operating efficiency in scale up to be able to then execute projects of a reasonable size. I'm going to give you a very quick example of that.  So to date, as we are building [Indiscernible] as you know, you've heard us announce this before. We are building a 24 megawatt electrolyzer complex there. Those 24 megawatts will come from two megawatt modules, that's the largest PEM electrolyzer module available in the world today. We're working with ITM to scale that up. We are hoping to scale that up based on a technology roadmap in literally months to 5 megawatts and then beyond that to 20 megawatts, etc. At that point in time, a 100 megawatt module -- again, projects that we're actively working on today that are getting some preferential positioning as far as some European funding is concerned as well.  Those will then move from 50 units of 2 megawatts, which you can imagine on the most efficient structure, to maybe 5 units of -- or 20 units of 5 megawatts, or 5 units of 20 megawatts, as scale-up happens along the way. The fact that that scale-up is happening, the fact that the technology road map is providing that capital efficiency and economies of scale is happening right now and preparing us for what's likely to happen in the next 5 years. I don't want to speculate at this stage as to what that likely backlog might look like 5 years down the road, but clearly I'm encouraged by the developments I see.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you for the detailed answer. As you look at this technology road map, and green hydrogen cost coming down, where do you see that? Steve had commented on some numbers, maybe a year ago. And what about this production tax credit of $3 for green hydrogen, how would that play out? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: P.J. that production tax credit is actually very -- it'll be a very good supporting mechanism. We talked earlier on about in the previous question about how we see the incentive support the development that $3 per kg will be a good support mechanism. We obviously have to read the rules and it hasn't yet come through, so I'm looking with some eagerness to that coming through and getting an understanding of how those rules come into play. But that would be encouraging. Clearly, we believe that there is an opportunity here for us to move forward. Steve mentioned to you in the past that if we get hydrogen, blue or green. Green, obviously, more challenge in this reference, at about between $1 to $2 per kg.  It's at that point that you see an inflection point and you see widespread adoption of technologies utilizing hydrogen, and really hydrogen becoming a reasonable fuel in the portfolio of fuels we'll have. We'll always have fossil fuel, at least for many decades ahead. But it'll be a more important part of that portfolio fuels and energy basket as well. Steve, you want to add something?
Steve Angel: Okay, Sanjiv, I'll add something. Just to build on that, if you were to look at the cost of hydrogen today and you were to use the U.S. Gulf Coast, which obviously we produce a lot of hydrogen, we use a lot hydrogen in the U.S. Gulf Coast, gray hydrogen is about a $1.30 kilogram, and that's at 5-50 natural gas. Carbon capture would add another 40-50 cents, maybe you're in the 1.17 range, and if you think about green, it's like about $4.5 a kilogram. And out of that probably 2.50, you call it, is the renewable power cost.  And so if renewable power was free, then you would still have $2 and we all know renewable power isn't free, so we have some work to do to bring those costs down in terms of capital costs, operating costs and as you were to work that down below that $2 number, then you've got a chance to have something competitive. So you did the combination of low-cost renewable, low-cost capital, low-cost operate, low-cost capital, and better efficiencies, and then you can drive that number lower. And I would say ideally below two, but certainly in that range would be, is what's needed.
P.J. Juvekar: Great, thank you for the color and congratulations.
Operator: And our last question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Andrews, please go ahead with your question.
Steve Angel: David, it looks like he has an issue. I think with that we can wrap it up.
Operator: Okay.
Steve Angel: For everyone online, thank you so much for attending today's call. For your reference, the copy of our transcript will be posted on our website within the next 24 hours. Thank you for listening and if you need anything else, let me know. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 Linde Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Juan Pelaez: Crystal, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending our 2021 second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Chief Financial Officer; and Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Operating Officer.  Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv and Matt will now give an update on Linde's business outlook and second quarter performance, and we'll then be available to answer your questions.  Let me turn the call over to Sanjiv.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Linde employees, once again, produced stellar results in the second quarter, achieving multiple new records, including a 24.2% operating margin, a $2.7 earnings per share, and 15.7% return on capital. Volumes grew 15%. Pricing increased 3%, along with global recent inflation. And we continue to optimize the business through many productivity initiatives. I'm really proud of how the Linde team delivered industry-leading performance, despite the many challenges we constantly face. And I expect to continue this performance for many years to come. Last quarter, I presented to you the Linde strategy, which outlined the leavers that we use to grow EPS, more than 10% per year. Given the results so far, I think it's safe to say we are well on our track. That said, I believe it's also important to have a clear path to future revenue expansion, which I'd like to discuss on the next slide. So, on slide three, you'll see that when previously I had highlighted to you that Linde has a unique advantage of being able to offer its customers a sale of gas or sale of plant option. Our engineering capabilities are a clear competitive advantage, allowing us to participate in almost every type of growth opportunity, while maintaining our investment criteria. Going forward, we are therefore going to present the sale of gas and sale of plant backlog combined. This quarter, our total project backlog stands at approximately $7.5 billion, representing contractual growth with high-quality customers and secured cash flows. Now, in addition to this project backlog, in parallel, we also invest around $1 billion per year on base business growth opportunities. These are great opportunities to deliver high-quality long-term growth, but they're either under $5 million in spend or don't contain contractual fixed fee elements for secured incremental growth. Base growth projects typically also have shorter execution times, a margin accretive and support our network density strategy. Some examples include the clean energy projects we announced earlier this year, the hydrogen liquefier in the U.S. Gulf Coast that we recently started up and, of course, more than 25 small on-site projects that we have already run this year. We saw glass, pulp and paper, mining and other growing end markets with these small on-sites. In addition, the business continues to leverage a dense network, with winning new merchant and packaged accounts, which further enhances the quality of our business. I stated we currently have approximately $7.5 billion of contractually secured growth projects, which we'll execute over the next three to four years, plus $1 billion per year of incremental base growth CapEx. The revenue expansion from these investments exclude organic growth already been captured from our existing dense supply network across a diverse spectrum of end markets. Of course, the growth demonstrated how we leverage this through the current economic recovery that you're seeing. As I sit here today, we are currently reviewing a pipeline of hundreds of prospective projects, not included in this backlog, which easily represent more than $10 billion of potential investment opportunities, including a significant number of electronics and clean energy projects and, of course, sale of planned projects. Both sale of gas and sale of plant are great ways for us to grow, while maintaining our investment discipline. Given our strong execution capability, I remain bullish on Linde's outlook and growth prospects. Regardless of what happens with inflation or macro economic trends or the pace of secular growth drivers, we have a proven business model that can generate compound value growth for our shareholders today and decades into the future. Now, before I hand it to Matt, I want to make a comment on our ESG goals. I mentioned to you in last quarter's call that we are developing new ambitious ESG goals, which we expected to share in the near future. We've been diligently working with our business leaders around the world to determine these targets and more importantly, to incorporate them in our operating rhythm. Based on that progress, I expect to disclose these new ESG goals before the end of the year. I'll hand over now to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and guidance. Matt? 
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to slide four for an overview of the second quarter results. Sales of $7.6 billion are up 19% from 2020 and 5% sequentially versus prior year volumes increased 15% across all supply modes and end markets. Manufacturing, chemicals, and metals drove this increase, since Q2, 2020 was the low point for cyclical markets. Sequentially, volumes increased 4%, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of volume expansion, demonstrating our leverage to the economic recovery. Price increased 3% versus prior year and 1% sequentially, as all geographic segments continue to manage inflation. This is also evident in the 2% energy costs pass-through related to on-site contracts. Operating profit of $1.8 billion increased 39% over prior year and 9% sequentially. Operating margin of 24.2% was 350 basis points over last year, despite a 50 basis point headwind from cost pass-through. This represents the eighth quarter in a row we have increased operating margin more than 200 basis points from a combination of volume expansion, pricing actions and productivity measures. EPS of $2.70 increased 42% from 2020 and 8% from the first quarter.  We've also provided the Q2, 2019 growth rate of 48%. As mentioned last quarter, I believe it's important to distinguish true growth, which this clearly demonstrates from mere recovery. ROC, which is one of the most important metrics in this industry, rose to a record 15.7%. It has increased every quarter since 2018 from steady profit growth over a prudently managed capital base. In fact, Linde has consistently proven the ability to deliver industry-leading high-quality growth by following a disciplined capital allocation model. Slide five provides more color on that capital allocation model, including overall cash management. You can see the progression of operating cash flow on the table to the left, with the first half up 27% over last year. Note that we had $300 million of higher cash taxes this quarter when compared to Q2 last year. Since this is only timing related, I expect operating cash flow to improve year-over-year and sequentially in the third quarter. To the right, you can see how we allocated capital for the first half this year. Stated simply, we want to grow the business, invest back into the business and reward our shareholders with increasing dividends and share repurchases. I think the pie chart below confirms this approach. We invested $1.5 billion into the business and returned $3.2 billion back to shareholders. I'll wrap up with guidance, which you can find on slide six. This slide is similar to last quarter, including how we set the guidance ranges. Third quarter guidance is $2.60 to $2.70. This represents 21% to 26% growth over prior year and 34% to 39% growth over 2019. Compared to Q2, this assumes no sequential improvement in the underlying economy and a 1% foreign currency headwind. For full year 2021, we are raising prior guidance by $0.50 to a new range of $10.10 to $10.30. This $0.50 increase is from the Q2 outperformance and the higher Q3 guidance range. In other words, and consistent with last quarter, we have not updated the fourth quarter at this time. Rest assured next call we will provide an updated and more meaningful fourth quarter guidance. And if volume trends are stable or improve, we'll be at the upper end or above this range. Until that time, we remain highly confident in our ability to grow 2021 EPS at least 23% from last year and 38% from 2019, while positioning Linde for industry-leading long-term value creation. And now, I'd like to hand the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Sanjiv, you map this 15% of volume growth in the quarter, what do you think that was versus the industry? Did you gain share do you think this quarter versus competitors?
Sanjiv Lamba: David, thanks for that question. So, as you saw, solid growth and we mentioned across all end markets as well. The reality is we saw that economic recovery come through. We've set as part of our strategy. We'd leverage that economic recovery. That's what we're seeing happen around. I would say that in some markets we have seen some share gain, but that's kind of an ongoing business transactional element that we see all along.
David Begleiter: Very good. And Matt, thinking about share buybacks, how should we think about buybacks in the back half of the year?
Matt White: Yeah. So David, as you know, from our capital allocation policy, we'll continue to sweep excess cash towards buybacks. So, year-to-date, we've been over $2 billion. We're on a good pace. And as I mentioned, I expect Q3 cash to be higher. So, I see no reason why we need to deviate from kind of our current pattern. But obviously, our priority continues to be to invest in growth, which we're going to do. And as Sanjiv mentioned, we have a lot of opportunities there, but we'll also be repurchasing shares pretty much every day in the market.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tony Jones from Redburn. Your line is open.
Tony Jones: Thank you and thanks for letting me ask questions. Good morning. Yeah. I've got two, actually. One was on volumes. So, if I look at say Q2, 2019 and then sort of adjust for the price and cost pass-through this quarter has just reported, sort of implies volumes are up about 3%, 4% versus that Q2 in 2019, but slightly down in Asia. Firstly, I guess, is that right? Does it maybe imply some further optionality in Asia-Pacific? And can we use that sort of underlying 3% to 4% volume growth versus 2019 the next couple of quarters? And then a second question, sorry. If I'm asking quite a few things here. CapEx in the cash flow and also as a percentage of sales, looks like it's been trending down for awhile, but the project backlog looks really solid. How should we think about that? Or is it just the post-pandemic timing effects of investments? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Tony, thanks. Why don't I jump into the CapEx piece and then I'll ask Matt to just talk through the volumes and reconcile them. Just on CapEx, I think one of the reasons we are providing that pipeline view today was to give you a sense of how we see that opportunity. I've said in the past, I've seen some improvements and proposal activity across both sale of gas and sale of plants and on the sale of gas side, that proposal activity, particularly coming from electronics as an example, and, of course suite of clean energy projects and the more traditional markets as well, including chemicals and us and others. So, I do expect to see that CapEx reflecting the pipeline opportunity that we just defined. So, I don't see -- I mean, the changes are marginal anyway, but notwithstanding that I see absolutely no concerns around how I expect that pipeline to flow into backlog. Matt?
Matt White: Yeah. Thanks. And Tony, yeah, just to answer the volume question, your calculation is close, but it's about 5% globally is what we would have seen Q2 volumes versus 2019 from this quarter. And Asia-Pac actually is leading, it's more around 8%. So, I'm not sure if maybe in the deconsolidation or how you calculated that. But the volumes in APAC were about 8% above Q2, 2021 versus Q2, 2019. And we're pretty much off mid single digits across the board for all the regions. So, I would say we're seeing the right patterns and the right traction and obviously price 3% to 4% as well when you look at that metric versus 2019.
Tony Jones: Thank you. That's great. Good detail.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bob Koort: Thank you very much. Good morning.
Sanjiv Lamba: Good morning.
Bob Koort: Yeah. I wanted to ask about the Jurong Island project that was going to start up in 2023. How's that progressing, I think it's your biggest ever investment? And what have you learned if anything about building those gasifiers? Thanks.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Bob. So, one of our larger investments as you rightly point out, that's progressing well. Obviously, there has been some COVID impact on our schedule as well as of our customer, that's still on track to getting largely mechanically complete by the dates that we'd originally set out plus or minus a few weeks. And to be honest, Bob, we've been running gasifiers at that Singapore site for decades. So, really, none of this is new for us. From an engineering point of view, we've been building gasifiers for decades as well. So, there's a lot of that organizational learning that we've been able to put into that project. So, it's coming along quite nicely.
Bob Koort: And as a follow-up, if I might, you guys have an interesting seat in the whole gasifier hydrogen economy, that's developing. I wonder if you can give us your latest thoughts on which way that's going. Is it going to be globally distributed hydrogen from single complexes in the best electricity areas? Is it going to be locally produced hydrogen? Is it going to be ammonia, any updated thoughts on how you see that ecosystem evolving?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. Sure. Happy to provide that, Bob, and that's a great question. So, it is, as you rightly point out, a very fast developing dynamics space, and we start talk more and more about clean energy more broadly. But just talking about the specifics of what you've asked. So, our view is, when we think about our strategy, we believe local execution and locally driven strategies are where we see the most value creation in terms of our business model and in terms of how we kind of attempt to take that strategy to execution, where we are demonstrating that the South Korea, local market, where we are putting a liquefier in, building a whole ecosystem around liquid fueling for heavy duty vehicles. So, that's kind of broadly our strategy. Now, I must add to that with all of that obviously, we also recognize there's a portfolio approach that we would be taken to this. And we do expect to see that there will be some larger installations that that would feed markets, which may not be entirely local, which might have some export content to it. But we do see the distributed model as being certainly both more effective and creating greater value, but supplemented in cases by some larger production facilities, but you have some obvious competitive advantages. I mean, we've talked previously about how you could get in Northern Africa as an example, very low cost electricity that allows you to put a large complex, green hydrogen production facility, and the best way to get that hydrogen to market, as an example, would be to then take it from that large complex and buys it across to Europe, if you put. And again, you'd have to repurpose some of the existing pipelines and make sure that cost effectively gets to Europe for it to have some traction there. So, that's one example that we think, you would see -- changes that happened in Chile with the -- the desert has -- is similar advantage of very high-quality solar, the ability to take that put into renewable power, generate green hydrogen, and then move it to markets close to it. Does that give the color you were looking for?
Bob Koort: Yes. Perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicola Tang from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Nicola Tang: Hi, everyone and thanks so much for the interesting some color around the project backlog. I wanted to ask a little bit around that. What's the backlog itself -- pretty solid at the $7.5 billion. The size of the backlog itself hasn't really been growing. If anything, I think it was more like $9 billion or $10 billion a couple of years ago. If you talked about those hundreds of projects where like, potentially $10 billion, can you talk about the potential timing of adding those into the backlog? As existing projects come online, and then, that will drop out the backlog. Do you expect to see growth in the backlog, or actually it will be more stable at current levels on a sort of net-net basis? And then the second question similarly around the backlog was, I was curious, Rajiv, you mentioned that you're seeing project activity or potential project activity in traditional sort of industrial areas. I was curious to understand, what areas -- what you're seeing that pickup in activity? Yeah, and then I've got a next step, but I'll pause that.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Nicola. So, let me start over with the backlog. And then we come back to the project activity pickup that I referenced. So, as you said, the backlog is $7.5 billion, it gets impacted by startups that we have. So, we are going to have some startups later this year, and we'll see that that impact flow through -- you've actually got some press releases that we had recently around some of those as well. Now, in terms of timing of the projects coming into the backlog, as you know, we don't often control that timing, more often than not one controls the timing, because you kind of doesn't let us announce many of these wins, but notwithstanding that, you will see in the second half an improvement in that backlog come through, because we are very close on a couple of projects, which we think will be formally closed out, but just contract signed before we can bring them on. Again, Nicola, you know this, but I'll just recap it. Our conditions for putting something as a backlog are very stringent. They have to be secured by a contract. It must be more than $5 million, obviously for the larger projects, that doesn't matter. And it needs to have a guaranteed cash flow profile, which ensures that, that backlog then has incremental, guaranteed incremental growth. So, those conditions have to be met and we see a number of projects that will flow into the backlog later this year. And then some obviously in the early part of next year as well. So, I've been reasonably confident on the developments that we are going to see in that backlog, both on the sale of gas and the sale of plant side. Now, I'll move on to the proposal activity. So, I'm going to talk about one area in particular where we see a significant amount of activity. And you've heard me references before, Nicola, at one time as a surprise, which is electronics. And really you've been hearing in the press, obviously a lot about chip shortages, but the reality is, that industry has been looking at ramping up its production capabilities for about 12 months now. And there are a whole sub projects that are all in various stages of development by TSMC, by Samsung, by Intel, by GlobalFoundries. There's a long list of people who are going to be investing in that space. And therefore, a large part of our time at the moment in that proposal activity is being spent around electronics area in particular, Nicola. Now, in addition to that, we're also seeing some chemicals projects. We're also seeing even -- and it might surprise some, but even in the seal area, we're seeing some projects. The one other area Nicola, which kind of is really linked to clean energy, but where we seeing refining, chemical, even steel companies engage actively with us, is around reduction in their emissions, or in the case of refining, what can we do around carbon capture and making -- reducing their emissions? How can we help them create technical solutions? I've said this before in the last call that, we have a full suite of technologies around this. We have the ability working with partners to provide a holistic solution to many of our customers in that space. And again, we're seeing a lot of activity pick up on that and move forward.
Nicola Tang: That links quite nicely to my last question on sort of the decarbonization point. I was wondering if you had any initial thoughts on the use for 55 proposal and potentially what it means for Linde and/or the wider gases industry, I suppose? And whether there's any sort of progress on CO2 framework on the U.S. side and somebody, what can that mean for you?
Sanjiv Lamba: So, Nicola, you've heard me say this before. That's for decarbonization more broadly and the hydrogen economy, particularly the pickups, we need a couple of three things to happen, obviously regulation with deep. We've seen that happen very much in Europe. I think your point is absolutely valid that, we see Europe provide the kind of penalties and incentives, the guidance sticks, which are allowing momentum to build in that space quite actively and aggressively. So, that was good to see. We are participating in that, whether it's gypsy funding, whether it's other incentives, whether it's the broader coalition that is looking at contract for differences to make sure that we're leveraging facilities elsewhere to support European economies. I've also said -- and of course, just to make the points in the U.S., we are encouraged to see progress happening in that area as well. Now, that the U.S. currently offers 45Q, our view is that that is inadequate for any substantial momentum to build up in the space, but I'm encouraged by -- conversations going on in the House. And hopefully the Senate that'll move some of the incentives and proposals forward in that space. So, I'm looking forward to seeing developments there quite closely. So, I guess, the other couple of things that need to happen, which I think, create the momentum that we need. And I am at the risk of repeating myself from the last call, we do need to see that the technology roadmaps ensure that the technology for either green and blue which is currently available and scalable, creates the cost curve that is necessary for large scale adoption to happen. That remains -- I won't say that the challenge that is actively being worked on, but there is a timing challenge to that. And I know take years before we get to a point, but green in particular, has the ability to have a cost-effective solution available at scale, good solutions that are available today. We provide many of those ourselves, but I recognize that there was still a scale up, that is currently lacking in the green hydrogen space. And finally, I think we need to be working very closely with making sure that the endpoint consumption in this case, if we're talking about heavy duty, vehicles, buses, or trucks, or indeed trains and ferries, that technology development in that space is happening actively. Hence the number of partnerships that we do to make sure that we're right in the middle of those developments, and we are encouraging and promoting them as much as possible. So, I know I've provided the border answer than you were looking for, but I think this was worth recapping, because these are the things that are ensuring that the momentum that we see today sustains, and you actually see investment and development in that space.
Nicola Tang: That's great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Your returns on capital have moved up, which is natural given your cost reduction programs and the growing economy. Have your returns on capital though in your on-site projects really changed over the past couple of years? That is, are the returns on capital and an on-site going up or staying the same?
Matt White: Jeff, this is Matt. How are you? So, our investment criteria is the same. So, we've maintained that throughout and therefore, how we look at the projects and the expectations we have, remained the same. But to your exact point, given the density model that we have, we're getting significant growth on this business on a non-capital intensive basis. And then, we continue to deliver on our projects, startup our projects and execute those projects, which deliver on the expected returns that we entered into them on. And the combination of the two is giving us a significant acceleration in return on capital. And at this point, we continue to see this happen and as long as these trends continue, it should bode well for that metric going forward.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you for that. And in your -- in the hydrogen area, when you contemplate various projects, are any of the projects that you contemplate involved with ammonia being made in some jurisdiction, whether it's the Mid East or Australia or somewhere else that is -- are you working with any possible builders of those projects or you're not doing that?
Sanjiv Lamba: Right. Jeff, so, our headline that by saying yes, we are. And I want to kind of give you a slightly broader picture as well, I guess, just to give you a sense of where we stand on the hydrogen piece. So, as you know, I've mentioned this before on a previous call that we run our Linde hydrogen council. We meet every month, we review all the projects. The last -- the last review we had a couple of weeks ago was, saw 240 projects across that whole range of opportunities in that space, adding up to, what we call, probability related CapEx, so value about $4.1 billion. So, again, these are -- some of these are larger projects, obviously large -- we see a large number of mobility projects, which tend to be somewhat smaller. But to your point, one of the areas where we've seen both the increase in the number of projects, as well as large size projects is the space of carbon capture. And beyond that, we then look at hydrogen and ammonia as being two elements, which kind of get added on downstream to that. So, the answer is yes, we were working with a number of different customers and players who are looking at the ammonia loop. Jeff, you may also be aware that Linde has its own ammonia loop technology out of Linde Engineering. So, we've done a number of these ammonia loops elsewhere, including in the Middle East and in Eastern Europe and in the U.S. So, we have that unique advantage of being able to tie all of those technologies in and provide those solutions, which makes it very attractive to many of our customers.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning, Sanjiv and Matt. Sanjiv, does your deal with ITM give you any advantage in winning green hydrogen projects, since you have the PEM technology through the joint venture, and can you sort of give examples of that?
Sanjiv Lamba: Yes. PJ, hi. So, yes, of course. So, the deal with ITM is unique in many ways, PJ. The first that we are an equity investor in ITM, that means we are still in the game with them. But more importantly, we have a joint venture with ITM, that there is Linde Engineering/ITM joint venture called ILE, which is where all the scale up on larger projects above a particular size happens. And that is what gives us the unique competitive advantage of having access to grade them technology and being able to support ITM in scaling that up for large projects that we're looking at and pursuing. And again, we are seeing good developments in that space. A lot of proposal activity, PJ, as I referenced earlier on. We are very close in a number of cases in those discussions with some select customers. So, really pleased to see that ITM linkage and find ourselves leveraging that quite actively, as we develop these projects.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. Great. And sticking to green hydrogen, you also had a deal with Plug Power to use their fuel cells to convert some of your Class 6 and Class 8 trucks over to hydrogen. Can you give us an update on that? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: So, PJ, we are working with Plug Power and we work with Plug Power in many different ways. We supply most of the hydrogen requirements today, as an example, while they don't have their own facilities up. We are also looking at a collaborative development in a number of other spaces, which hasn't been announced yet, but we are kind of progressing on different fronts over there. One of the things that we have agreed with Plug Power and I must admit here with a few other players as well is that we will be trialing on our trucks fuel cells and then we'll be moving our products to hydrogen. So, we already have a plan in place for the U.S., for Europe and South Korea to be progressing with those trials and seeing how they move forward. So, again, a lot of activity happening in that space. We are really waiting with bated breath, PJ, to get these trucks on the road.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Clark from SocGen. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. The first question is around -- it’s a actually following on from the first question you had about the market share. Particularly looking at the U.S. packaged gas business, because I know there's differences in mix. I know the biggest competitor out there has a lot of hard goods, a lot of construction, but you've been seeing double-digit growth now in that business in the first quarter, you probably accelerated and what you saw in the first quarter, in the second quarter, and they're still actually down particularly dragged back by the hard good. So, I'm just wondering, are you taking some share, or is it all about mix and maybe regional? And then, the second question is around the investments. Obviously, you're very excited with all the organic investment you have, and the potential for that. I'm just wondering on the potential acquisition line, are you just not seeing many potential targets that fit the criteria on return, given what you can do internally with your money? Thank you.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Peter. A great question. So, I have to admit, Peter, I am thrilled with the U.S. packaged gas business in the way -- that team is really moving forward at the moment, but they've received double-digit growth, both on gas and hard goods. We see strong sequential growth on both of those elements as well. So, I know I've read, some of our competitors talking about that space, but the reality is we are certainly growing very strongly in that space. And I see us kind of moving forward. Anecdotally, obviously, people will tell you that we are taking share, but I don't particularly want to comment on that. That is anecdotal, but you can look at the numbers. And I think, the comparison will kind of tell its own -- get you to the right conclusion. So, again, very strong performance over there on both hard goods and gases. If I move on to investments and talk a little bit about the acquisition space. So, one of the challenges, Peter, as you'll appreciate, given where we stand in our size and having come -- lift through three years of regulatory approvals on the merger, we are very sensitized to how large acquisitions can happen. So, we are left with a much smaller pool of opportunities there. We will do tuck-in acquisitions in most of our markets any day, a good high-quality tuck-in acquisition, we will go after and we will do that, as soon as we find them. And, of course, they have to live up to our investment criteria requirements, as you know well. The larger ones become a little more challenging, particularly as we've got to kind of understand the requirements from local regulatory environments or antitrust, et cetera. And that's where typically something larger trips up. So, do I expect to see us doing acquisitions moving forward? Yes. Will you see a large number of tuck-ins happen? Most likely where we find those opportunities come through, we will certainly pursue them, all day long if we could.
Peter Clark: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Haire from UBS. Your line is open.
Geoff Haire: Good morning. Just have two quick questions. First of all, in the margin improvement that you report, can I just check, does that include any benefit from rising energy costs? And if it does, could you possibly break that out? And then, just looking at the operating cash flow, which has obviously flattened Q2 year-on-year and down sequentially, you've mentioned higher cash taxes. Are there any other movements within the cash flow in the quarter that are -- and have a negative impact?
Matt White: Okay. Hi, Geoff. It's Matt. I can answer that. So, I think your first question, just to make sure I got it right. You were asking about margin related to energy. Can you repeat that one again? I kind of lost.
Geoff Haire: Yeah. So, obviously you've got big margin improvement that you've been reporting, almost every quarter since you've come -- you've merged. I'm just trying to understand is, within that margin improvement, you've obviously had rising energy costs. Does not give you a benefit to the margin as well? And so, I'm trying to look at what the margin improvement would be net of rising energy costs?
Matt White: Yeah. So, on that one, the actual -- the rising energy costs will dilute your margins and that's what we call cost pass-through. So, we isolate costs pass-through. And obviously what that is, it's as simple grossing up. So, you'll see the sales and cost of goods rise equal dollar amounts. So, therefore, it has no effect on our variable contribution or gross contribution dollars, but it will have a negative effect on your margin, because you're simply doing a gross up effect. So, we isolate that out as cost pass-through that is primarily natural gas and electricity energy. So, those components tend to drive that. Obviously, as inflation you're seen in those type commodities rises, we will pass them through, but they will dilute our margins. So, for example, year-over-year, I'd mentioned while we're up to 350 bps on our margin, that includes a 50 basis point headwind related to this cost pass-through. So, excluding that, we would have been up 400 basis points year-over-year. So, we are passing it through as our contracts enable, but it will be diluted. As far as operating cash flow, yeah, to your point, the $300 million that was incremental year-over-year, it's about $250 million sequentially, with the impact of taxes and that is purely timing just when payments were made. In addition, working capital, probably was about $100 million or so unfavorable, part of that is growth and we are growing. So, we're consuming a bit of working capital. But when I look at our cash conversion cycles, our DSOs, they're quite good across the board. Another piece is simply engineering timing. As you saw engineering was consuming a bit of their backlog. What that is on a cash cycle? You tend to have more of a negative downside, but as Sanjiv mentioned, we have a high degree of confidence of our entire backlog, including sale of plants. So, we feel that's something looking forward will turn around and I feel pretty good about where our Q3 cash flow will be and making some of this timing backup, both on working capital, as well as cash taxes.
Geoff Haire: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Markus Mayer from Baader Bank. Your line is open.
Markus Mayer: Yeah. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions from my side. First of all, on your nitrogen business, given the recovery of the oil price, was there already a positive effect on your nitrogen fund or recovery business? And if not, what kind of oil prices you think you need to or your business need to see a recovery there? Can't be back to 2013, 2014 levels. And the second question will be on the effect of startups you expect this year and also next year that we can basically strip out the underlying business together, this new business.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Marcus. So, your question on nitrogen and recovery using nitrogen, as you know, we've got a couple of large customers who do that. That's been fairly stable through this period, so we haven't really seen a significant volatility in that. It's been stable and works right through. The geology is, Marcus, that as you are using nitrogen for enhanced recovery, you are then in that process linked to that you can't really step out or provide a lot of volatility, it doesn’t great for the field. So, you see that it's fairly stable levels.  In terms of startups, yes, we do have a number of startups happening. As you know, from time to time, we kind of release -- provide a press release that covers some of those. I don't want to name them, but we do have a few happening towards the end of this year. And yes, beginning of next year as well, there'll be a few more startups that'll happen.
Markus Mayer: But the kind of magnitude of growth, can you give us some kind of indication?
Sanjiv Lamba: So, one way to think about that, Marcus, is I'll bring you back to something that we've said in the past, and just gives you a correlation, which is when I think about our EPS growth, I'd say, our backlog and therefore that really -- that backlog getting converted into startups provides us roughly a two percentage point over a three-to-four-year period. That's what we like you to see from the backlog that we currently have. And that's one way to think about how that startup impact comes through down to the EPS level.
Markus Mayer: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, two of them tied to the same topic, which would be inflation. So, obviously, we're in a really kind of almost hyperinflationary market. Can you remind us in terms of the backlog that you've got and the projects that are in that backlog, how much of the equipment, the materials, et cetera, have already been locked up so that you don't have to worry about inflation? And what percent is maybe not necessarily locked in at this point that we have to kind of think about?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. John, so, when we get into a point of securing a project, whether it's on the sale of gas or the sale of plant side by then, we get into a very -- a fairly detailed costing mechanism. And we lock in our costs at that stage with all the OEMs in particular, but other vendors as well. So, when we are in the backlog stage of, most of our costs are already locked in pretty much. So that should give you a sense of how we stand. As we are seeing inflationary trends now, we already factoring that all -- those into the proposals that we're developing and providing to customers. So, again, we have good mechanisms in place, a lot of experience of having managers, John, to make sure that that coverage is very strong and innovate diligent process or rigorous process around it and our engineering team.
John McNulty: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just kind of tied into that, given this inflationary environment, it does look like your European business, your Asian business, we saw some price acceleration. Is that something -- given the inflation levels that we're seeing, that we could see further acceleration from the pricing that you're putting through. And I know it's pretty lofty already, but can we see even more of that, just given the environment, how should we think about that?
Sanjiv Lamba: So, John, that's a great question. And as we've kind of shown, 3% overall pricing comes through -- you'd know that a large part of the pricing comes through the merchant and package business and very little about really comes through the on-site line. So, therefore, you can do the math and you'll get to a number that says mid single digits on average, on pricing across those different segments, particularly from merchant and package. Now, our team has done a fabulous job of making sure that we remain ahead of the curve as far as inflation is concerned. We've been telling you this for about two quarters now, and I expect that team to continue to do that as we move forward. So, for us making sure that we are working that pricing. We were having those conversations with our customers. As we see those inflationary trends continue to come through, it remains right on top of mind for us.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Just a question, the $1 billion of base CapEx that you talked about, could you just talk to us about sort of what -- how sort of robust that menu of opportunity is? And why you choose it to be a $1 billion versus why isn't $500 million, or $2 billion? Is it -- as far as I can see, how does the returns there compare to the traditional CapEx backlog?
Sanjiv Lamba: Sure. Vince, that's a great question. I'm glad you asked that question, because I've been itching to talk a little bit about small on-site, so that's a good lead in there. So, let me pose -- just describe that. So, essentially, when we have projects and I think small on-site is a great example to just illustrate the point. Here we have -- we have long-term contracts, so these are contracted. We have kind of secured cash flows in there. But individually, these are less than $5 million each typically, what we call our small on-sites. And they have shorter execution timelines. They were accretive, good, solid returns. These are projects we'd love to do every day. And the reason I want to particularly talk about it today also is, because in the first half of this year, there's 20 -- more than 25 of these projects already. We've signed up more than 25 small on-site projects already. Now that's a 50% jump over last year. Same period last year, 50% higher than that. And I love this project, because great, solid return, good strong execution. These are packaged plants, so we can go in there and work on them very quickly. And which is why we get that execution advantage as well. And I think the other point to just make over here and while I -- most points, I think, we think about the merger being over and that's true. But here's an example of revenue synergies that we talked about, we never really got a -- we never really put a number to it, but this is a good example of how the revenue synergies from the merger are flowing through. That we brought in two suites of technologies, giving us a really strong position in that space. And we'll leverage that actively in kind of winning these deals that you see us put through. Now all of these come through that base CapEx. So, am I excited about that number of $1 billion? I am. There isn't a cap to it and that flexes with what the business does and what the needs of the market are. And clearly, we will flex that with what we see in the market demand. All of needs this -- those investments have to meet our investment criteria. That's all it needs. Good quality projects any day, anytime, happy to do, small or big. I hope that have sense.
Vincent Andrews: That was great. And maybe just as a follow-up and I might be reading more into this than I should. But now that you're combining sort of the sale of gas backlog and the sale of plant backlog, it feels to me, you're just sort of bringing the sale of plant business a little bit more to the front of the stage than perhaps spend in the past. I see clearly that that's a lower margin business, but it's a -- obviously a CapEx light business versus the sale of gas. So, I'm just wondering, am I correct that you're kind of thinking about the engineering business having more prominence on a go-forward basis? And do you have a plan there to sort of improve the margins and the returns, or is there more we're going to be hearing about it in the quarters and years to come?
Matt White: That's a great question. So, let me just take a step back if I may, and just talk about the concept of how we think about our business and opportunities, right? So, the starting point for us is, we want to be able to participate in the full range of opportunities that we see in the marketplace. And to do that, I have a unique competitive advantage, which I am going to leverage, which is the ability to offer an attractive sale of gas model or in some cases where that customer looking at those two models is not particularly keen on that to be able to offer and get the business with the sale of plant model, right? So, either proposal for me works quite well. Now, the profiles are a little bit different. You're right in saying that, doing an EPC type structure for us is asset light. It is ROC accretive. It's cash flow positive for us. So, we do think, our engineering capabilities and the fact that we have those capabilities executing day-in and day-out at a tremendous level is a really strong competitive advantage that we have. And we want to make sure we leverage that as much as we need to. Now, I do want to just make sure that you understand and recognize that we aren’t giving prominence to one or the other. These are two -- these are kind of two options I have and I use those options where I need to, and where I can exercise them and do what's best for the organization. Now, there are two kind of underpinning principles in there. One, I want to be able to approach every opportunity in my space that I have the advantage and the ability to execute on. And two, I want to maintain discipline and my investment criteria. And I think this is that unique advantage that we get, bringing the two together.
Vincent Andrews: Excellent. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter there. Historically, inflation environments tend to be good for industrial gas demand. And I'm just curious, given where we're at in this inflationary cycle, do you think there could be sort of a step-up in the multiplier for demand for industrial gases as we head into the next couple of years?
Sanjiv Lamba: Hey, Mike. That's a good question. So, when we think about inflation, typically we spend most of our time talking about what happens with the pricing side, but you're right. Inflationary environment, we actually like inflation as you've heard us say before. Largely because on the pricing side, we have the ability to pass -- much of that inflation through our contractual structures onto the customers. And also, it's a good opportunity for us to open the conversation on pricing. Now, typically when we see Inflationary environment, we do see some industrial activity pick up and recoveries happen and constraints that lead to that inflationary environment, that's where we play actively. And yes, I think in some areas we will see some of that play out into demand -- on the demand side as well.
Mike Sison: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy: Good morning. Sanjiv, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the Snam deal that you announced in December of last year to develop clean hydrogen projects in Europe. How has that partnership going in the early days? Is the paradigm to move inexpensive energy from Northern Africa up to the European continent? And if so, what are the barriers, if any, to making more substantial capital investments in that arena, does it have to do with technology and production economics, or perhaps more on the commercial side? Maybe you can flesh out how you see the future there.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Kevin. That's a really good question. So, the partnership with Snam is gone vile and we are like-minded in our view of how the market needs the hydrogen in Europe, in particular mainland Europe needs to be met and that kind of common understanding and common appreciation of what needs to happen is critical for that partnership development to move forward to getting something substantial happen. Now, as with all the things, Kevin, these things take time, and there is, as you are aware, a lot of funding activity happening in Europe as we speak. And as part of that, I think we are waiting and watching to kind of see how that develops. So, that's in terms of how the partnership itself is moving forward. I want to just take a bit of time and talk about your other part of the question, which is, what do we see as elements that will either encourage or create barriers for some of these substantial developments to accelerate and get momentum. And here -- and unfortunately, I'll be repeating myself a little bit here, but I said earlier on that -- to Nicola's question that, you need a couple of things to be happening in tandem, right? One, you need to see the regulatory environment, with some -- come into place, in Europe we do have that. But I must admit at the same time that it is complex. I want to bureaucratic, but it's almost out of -- has a number of administrative controls. It goes through a country process for us then at the European Union level, and then some allocations will happen. And there's a whole suite of activities that need to happen before some of that funding and incentives become actually available for you to be able to go out and make these substantial developments happen. So, there is a whole piece that, is just -- it's part of the process. On the technology side, the other piece that I mentioned, you need a roadmap where you can develop on the assumptions and Europe is kind of chosen the part of green. My view is that scale will happen on blue hydrogen before it happens on green. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that that is true today and will be true for a number of years to come. Technology for scaling up on blue exists today. Linde provides that whole suite of technologies today to be able to do that. So, on the green side, which is very -- Europe is kind of move forward and I want to select it, but certainly lean towards, we will need to see that technology development to scale happen. I think that is a technology roadmap. That's kind of three to five years out. You need low cost renewable energy. Again, that's a development that's in progress and not available everywhere in Europe, as you know, which is why this whole concept of Africa becomes so attractive and Northern Africa in particular. And you also need effective technology roadmap for the electrolysis to be able to bring that capital efficiency up to a point to -- capital down efficiency up to get to a point where you can then create a cost advantageous position for green. I see those as -- both work in progress. We are actively involved in all of those activities as we move forward, but it is still work in progress.
Kevin McCarthy: Very helpful. Thank you, sir.
Operator: Thank you. And we will take our last question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Can you just elaborate on the discussion around pricing? Are you seeing existing on-site customers start reopening contract negotiations or renewals earlier than normal to get in front of the inflationary cycle?
Matt White: Hey, Jeff, or Laurence, sorry. It's Matt. I would say no. Things are pretty consistent with as you would expect. I mean, normal pattern is usually two to three years prior to the exploration. You begin to talk about the renewal and any type of inflationary environments usually don’t have any impact on that.
Laurence Alexander: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Juan Pelaez for any closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Crystal, thank you. And thank you everyone online for participating today's call. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Linde Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Juan Pelaez: Crystal, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for attending our 2021 first quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Chief Financial Officer; and Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Operating Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Sanjiv and Matt will now give an update on Linde's business outlook and first quarter performance, and we'll then be available to answer your questions. Sanjiv, all yours.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Juan, and good morning, everyone. Once again, the Linde team delivered another stellar quarter across all fronts, 32% growth in EPS, 57% growth in operating cash flows, operating margins expanding 320 basis points and of course, ROC at 14.5%. And of course, very strong progress across our ESG goals of reducing carbon intensity and making strides in gender diversity. Matt will walk through the more -- through the details on the financial numbers. But frankly, they speak for themselves. A few months ago, we marked the 2-year anniversary of the merger. So I'd like to take the opportunity to recap both our performance and also provide you a medium-term outlook on expected financial performance going ahead. Let me move on to Slide 3. Slide 3 shows our 2018 to 2020 growth relative to key competitors across 4 major financial metrics: EPS, operating profit margin, operating cash flows and, of course, very importantly, return on capital. From my perspective, these are the 4 most important financial metrics to determine performance in this industry. And it is, of course, quite clear from that slide, as you see, that we have led across all 4. In fact, I'd say with some pride that Linde has the undisputed best performance in the entire industry since our merger. Our employees have accomplished this while integrating 2 global companies during possibly the worst pandemic in a century. But of course, this is nothing new. We have been the industry leader for almost 3 decades now. And I want to move on to Slide 4 and talk a little bit about that history of over 25 years from 1993 to 2017 as the last full year before the merger. The compound annual growth rate of Linde's sales, EPS, dividend and operating cash flow exceeds both competitors across the board. We have a long history of generating compound value for our shareholders while sustainably and profitably growing the company. And of course, Linde's outperformance extends beyond just our industry. On the right-hand side over there, you can see the EPS CAGR that we've had over the same period against the broader S&P 500. So it's clear we've been the industry leader for many years, and we fully expect to continue that trend for decades to come. Our midterm strategy, which is on our next Slide 5, provides a road map on how we plan to get there. Most of you have seen this strategy before. It's fairly straightforward and simple enough that we can summarize it on one page. It starts, of course, with optimizing our base business of industrial gases and engineering. I've said this before, our unique operating rhythm provides a real competitive advantage on how we extract value year in and year out, irrespective of the macroeconomic climate. We've, of course, proven this in the prior recessions and some black swan events, including the most recent COVID pandemic. So while our resilient business model provides downside protection, we also have the ability to leverage and any economic recovery due to our exposure to the cyclical end markets, primarily here through merchant and packaged gases. Of course, the pricing structure here also helps as it closely correlates with inflation. You've already seen some of that demonstrated in the last few quarters, and I anticipate further upside if the economy continues to recover. Finally, we will continue to grow by capitalizing on future opportunities. Linde has demonstrated the highest compound growth rate in the industry across all key financial metrics, and we expect to maintain this distinction. Currently, there are secular growth drivers around 2 of our key markets that comprise about 30% of our sales. These are health care and electronics. You're all familiar with what is happening in the electronic space today. Our customers are looking to expand production of chips to meet soaring demand while improving and strengthening local supply chain logistics. We are an integral part of this development as industrial gases are a critical component to successfully operating a modern fab today. I fully expect electronics to comprise the largest portion of backlog wins over the next couple of years as we continue to see high levels of interest for new customer builds. Furthermore, the health care market continues to grow as well, combination of demographics and trend towards telehealth. As you know, our health care business, particularly the home care business, served as a critical second line of defense during the recent pandemic. And, of course, we expect future trends to create new growth opportunities, allowing us to leverage our leading dense network to support momentum towards a distributed health care market. The combination of these strategic elements should enable us to grow annual earnings per share on average more than 10%. That is something we've demonstrated throughout our history, and we feel confident we can continue for the long term. Now you will notice, I said 10% EPS outlook excludes the impact from the transition to clean energy. Currently, we view the benefits from this transition as incremental to our EPS outlook. Clean energy, of course, is a hot topic, as you all know. In fact, I haven't quite realized how many global hydrogen experts there really were until only 6 months ago. However, producing, storing and supplying hydrogen to enable cleaner fuels is something we've been doing for decades. In fact, hydrogen has been one of our fastest-growing molecules over the past 10 years. So given this, I'd like to use the last few slides to provide you a view on the overall clean energy market, explain why Linde is exceptionally well positioned to succeed and share with you our overarching strategy going forward. But before I start, I want to state that we are not providing specific guidance on either expected sales or wins from clean energy at this time. This is a rapidly evolving landscape with many countries taking different paths. So the pace of the transition is just too uncertain to make multiyear detailed projections. However, what I can confirm is that Linde has the experience, the technology and the asset network to be a significant player in the transition. To further elaborate on this, I'd like to provide you our view of the clean energy market on the next slide, Slide 6. It's safe to say that nobody really knows how the decarbonization market will ultimately play out. So it may be helpful to start with an overview of the potential opportunity. We think of clean energy transition in 2 main pieces. The first being how we can provide solutions to managing carbon and the second relating to clean hydrogen development. Now we already have a number of significant applications that reduce, capture, sequester or clean and monetize gas streams for use. A good example of this is our current carbon dioxide business at about $1.3 billion, serving several key end markets. Looking ahead, we see more opportunities for our technologies and solutions to enable our customers to reduce their carbon footprint through capture and removal of their emissions. Furthermore, we believe blue and green hydrogen will both play an important role in the transition to cleaner energy. In theory, the total available opportunity can be represented by the current $6 trillion of hydrocarbon market. However, that will be served by a blend of solutions, and it will take years to evolve. So as an example, one estimate assumes clean hydrogen will reach $100 billion by 2030, or say, roughly 1.5% of today's hydrocarbon market. But time will tell. Given the uncertainty, as I said before, I'm not going to provide you a specific estimate or time line today, but I do want to reiterate that this is a significant opportunity for Linde and something we see as an upside to our base business. So with this as a backdrop, it may be helpful to understand what Linde brings to the table regarding technology, asset network and experience which you can find on the next slide, Slide 7. Whether it's production, distribution or application and services, we have over 50 years of experience as an owner and an operator of billions of dollars of hydrogen infrastructure. We are agnostic to how that molecule is made, whether it's through reforming chemistry or by electrolysis. We have the technology and the operating expertise for all of them. Furthermore, we have the largest and the most dense hydrogen distribution network in the world. This will be crucial to ensuring a safe, reliable and cost-effective energy transition. Our technology, many proprietary applications and extended service capabilities, position us exceptionally well for this opportunity. And finally, we also have the ability to leverage our engineering business to integrate various technologies into solutions and to offer sale of gas or selectively, sale of equipment, providing us a unique competitive advantage. Overall, we have a very long and successful history supporting the transition to clean energy, and I believe we are incredibly well positioned across the entire value chain as this initiative accelerates. I'd like to wrap up the clean energy discussion on the next slide, Slide 8, with a view of our overarching strategy and give you some key supporting examples as well. The strategy on the left is something we've mentioned before. It represents a proven approach to profitably growing an industrial gas business, including hydrogen. It starts with leveraging a leading integrated asset network. In addition to that, we execute locally market-driven strategies. We believe many of these initiatives will vary by country. We also expect to continue to advance and grow our technology leadership in this space across the value chain by leveraging the expertise of our engineering team as well as developing partnerships that provide us access, insight and hopefully accelerate opportunities. Now on the right-hand side of the slide, you'll see 3 projects we recently announced. I just want to remind you that these are part of our base CapEx and, therefore, not included in the $3.5 billion backlog. Now these projects are over $350 million for green and blue hydrogen infrastructure in South Korea, Germany and the United States. Just to pick on the example in South Korea. We are partnering with one of the largest industrial conglomerates to build out a liquid hydrogen infrastructure to fuel municipality buses there. We continue to evaluate a significant and growing number of opportunities from large megaprojects to very small ones. But irrespective of the size of the opportunity, we will always maintain our disciplined approach to pursuing projects that meet our investment criteria. This summarizes our midterm strategy and how we currently see the clean energy market. But this is something I'll provide more updates on in the future as it continues to evolve. Now before I hand over to Matt, I want to make one final point on our ESG initiatives. Simply said, ESG is embedded in our culture. It's part of our operating rhythm and it's part of our compensation philosophy. It has been an integral part of our values and forms the foundation of Linde's mission statement, making our world more productive. I'm pleased to say we are currently tracking ahead in many of the initiatives we laid out in early 2020, including carbon emission intensity reduction and increasing gender diversity, but this isn't enough. We know we need to do more. We are therefore in the process of thoughtfully developing more ambitious ESG goals, which I expect to share with you in a future call. But until then, you can be certain that we will continue to improve our performance in this area. So with that, I'd now hand over to Matt, who will take you through the financial results and our guidance. Matt?
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to Slide 9 for an overview of the first quarter results. Before I jump into the numbers, I'd like to remind you that we deconsolidated a joint venture in APAC, which reduces sales and operating profit by about 3% but has no effect on EPS since we are maintaining a consistent ownership position. This deconsolidation is shown as a divestiture, and we provide further details in the APAC segment results, which you can find in the appendix. Total sales grew 7% from last year and were flat sequentially. Underlying sales increased 5% from prior year and 2% sequentially. Volumes continue to recover, growing 3% over last year and 1% over the fourth quarter. Sequentially, negative seasonal effects and temporary outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast from Storm Uri were more than offset by a broad-based increase in volumes. Industrial production levels have consistently risen in most geographies, which supports volume recovery in the packaged and merchant supply modes. And note that while Uri had a temporary negative effect on sales for the first quarter, profit impact was immaterial due to our contractual structure. Referring to our end market trends in the appendix, every end market grew sequentially and over prior year, except for food, mostly due to restaurant closures and seasonality in GIST, our distribution business in the U.K. Pricing improvements of 2% is in line with globally weighted inflation, since the majority of our contracts have mechanisms in place to adjust for local cost inflation. Operating profit increased 25% over prior year from a combination of higher pricing, incremental volumes and a lower cost base. Furthermore, operating margins expanded 320 basis points, which marks the seventh consecutive quarter that we have expanded operating margins more than 200 basis points. EPS of $2.49 grew 32% from last year and 8% sequentially. You can see the wider than normal growth rate differential between operating profit and EPS, which is mostly driven by the joint venture deconsolidation. We had another strong quarter in capital management, with operating cash flow up 57% and return on capital reaching 14.5%. ROC levels have been trending well as we continue to grow earnings by double-digit percent while maintaining a disciplined and focused capital allocation process. CapEx is down 5% from prior year as temporary declines in project backlog spending more than offset increases in growth projects categorized as base CapEx. Approximately 40% of base CapEx is for growth, including the clean energy projects Sanjiv mentioned as well as the majority of small on-site wins we announced yesterday. Overall, these results clearly validate our positive leverage to the economic recovery while offering significant downside protection as evidenced in 2020. Slide 10 provides an update on our capital management process. It starts with cash generation, which you can see on the left side. Linde employees have done a great job focusing on cash conversion and thus making more capital available for the company to deploy. Available operating cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less base CapEx, has exceeded $1.5 billion for the last 2 quarters. And while we continue to generate healthy levels of cash, how we spend it is equally important, which is shown on the right half of the slide. Our capital allocation process is simple and consistent. We have a mandate to maintain an A credit rating and raise the dividend every year. After which, our priority is to invest in growth that meets our criteria. And then any leftover cash is used for stock repurchases. The pie chart represents how we spent the first quarter operating cash, investing $0.8 billion to grow and returning $1.4 billion to shareholders. This approach provides balance, but more importantly, forms the foundation of the strategy and earnings outlook provided by Sanjiv. I'll wrap up with guidance, which you can find on Slide 11. The second quarter guidance range is $2.50 to $2.55. The midpoint represents an increase of 33% over 2020 and 38% over 2019. I believe it's important to provide the 2019 comparison to properly distinguish between true growth, which this demonstrates, from mere recovery which other companies may be showing. This guidance includes an estimated year-over-year FX tailwind of 4% since Q2 of 2020 was the low point on foreign currency weakness. Sequentially, this range assumes stable economic conditions with a moderate improvement related to normal seasonality. In other words, the Q2 guidance range does not assume any improvement in the underlying economy from Q1. Note that preliminary April results came in better than our internal estimates. So if these conditions persist, Q2 EPS would be at the upper end or above this range. The updated full year guidance range is $9. 60 to $9.80 or $0.50 higher than what we provided last quarter. The midpoint of the range is 18% above 2020 and 32% above 2019. I'd like to explain how we approached full year guidance especially as it relates to the half year comparisons. At this point, we have updated full year for the better performance in Q1 and the latest Q2 outlook of which this first half year combined was approximately $0.50 better. However, we have not updated the second half guidance. In other words, we left the second half alone until we get a better sense of the recovery pace. Rest assured, we will capture any improvement in the economy as we have recently demonstrated. Furthermore, we will provide a more detailed update next quarter. However, today, we are refraining from adjusting the back half until we get more visibility. Of course, if economic conditions hold or improve, we will be above this full year range. But for now, we believe this is the most prudent approach given the global uncertainty. I'd now like to turn the call over for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort: I appreciate the comments, Sanjiv, on the hydrogen markets and obviously, a lot of uncertainties how it all develops. I was curious, you put forth maybe an implied green hydrogen price in the future that's still 2 to 3x the price of gray hydrogen. And I'm just curious, do you think the world is going to need some carbon tax or some other ways to incentivize adoption of green hydrogen? How do you sort of see that developing?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Bob. That's a great question. I'm sure a lot of people are discussing that very fact as we speak, Bob. So you're absolutely right. Today, we do see that differential between green hydrogen to gray and blue hydrogen. Obviously, blue hydrogen somewhere in the middle, providing a more immediate scalable option. But green hydrogen, for it to kind of get to a point of inflection where adoption really happens, essentially, 3 things need to happen. The first, regulators across the world need to get to a view on what carbon tax, what carbon pricing or other mechanisms that create that incentive to go and do something about it are put in place. We can talk about what that range might look like, if you like. But that's a necessity. The second is, you've got to see the technology evolve and get down to a point where you're seeing significant reduction in costs. There are 2 costs for green hydrogen, as you're well aware, Bob. One is obviously renewable energy becoming cheaper. I know there's a lot of work happening in that space. And equally, we're doing a lot of work on the second option, which is about making sure that our planned CapEx comes down. So working through ITM on the PEM option as an example, but also making sure that efficiencies around that, the membranes improve sufficiently to give us a little bit of lift there as well. So all of those 3 things need to happen, Bob, for really adoption to happen, the inflection point that I referenced earlier on.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. First of all, I want to thank you and give a shout out to your employees in India who helped tremendously in getting oxygen to hospitals during this tragic situation. So, thank you there. And then my question is, as commodity prices go up for all kinds of commodities, with strong demand in metals and chemicals and general manufacturing, if your customers are seeing inflation, is it -- does it help you to get price as well from those customers? And then your pricing in Americas seems to have accelerated in 1Q compared to last few quarters. So can you just talk about this pricing dynamic?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, P.J. So I appreciate that shout out. And with family in India, I'm kind of acutely aware of how challenging the situation is there. I want to take maybe just a couple of minutes, P.J., before I get to your question to just talk briefly about how proud we are over here on our team in India who are currently working round the clock to support hospitals, patients, saving lives. Everything they do, it's kind of focused on that. The teams also kind of reworked their whole operating philosophy to produce more than 3,000 tonnes per day of medical oxygen. That's almost tenfold of what we were producing and delivering just 4 weeks ago. So a huge amount of work has gone in there. We've deployed about 1,200 drivers on the road, serving about 1,000 hospitals in the country. There's been phenomenal work being done on that. I thought it's appropriate that I just take a moment to kind of cover that. Of course, being a global corporation, Linde globally has been able to help as well. We've air lifted 40-plus ISO containers. They are now helping the supply chains in the country and another 40 to go in the days ahead. Governments have obviously taken on many of our ideas. You've seen the Oxygen Express that's going around India. Also, that's something that we've helped put in place and using the armed forces, in many cases, to move oxygen across various locations in the country. So a country in deep, deeply challenging situation, but we're doing all we can as is appropriate. I also want to just maybe quickly add a quick word of appreciation for our teams in Brazil, Mexico, other Lat Am countries. Obviously, they didn't get the same kind of press. But the reality is they were faced with similar challenges and have done enormously good work to support hospitals and patients. So, I'm really proud that our teams across the world are doing their bit to support our communities through this pandemic. Now P.J., I'm going to kind of more specifically talk to your question on inflation. And our view on inflation, as you know, we price to a weighted average on inflation typically. And as we think about inflation, our kind of natural conclusion there is that we will see prices going up as inflation happens. And we are -- as you know, have a great track record of being able to do that consistently. In fact, even when inflation wasn't quite there, you've seen us perform on our pricing. Our history on pricing is positive if you go back 20 years as well. And that's kind of the DNA that the team carries to move forward on the pricing piece. So fully expect to see that happening as inflation does come into play.
Matt White: And P.J., this is Matt. I may just add one or 2 things to what Sanjiv said. I think as a reminder, as you well know, any commodity cost or inputs we have, we pass all them through. That's contractual. And then the only second thing I'd add is what we've seen in these patterns before -- and 2011 is a good example, I'd say 2006, '07 are a good example and even 2016, when you do see some rebound in commodities, our customers' volumes tend to increase a lot. Their consumption of gases also tends to go up. So we'll see to what extent you can see that as well. I mean we're starting to see parts of it. But that also tends to be a positive tailwind with just overall industrial activity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tony Jones from Redburn.
Tony Jones: I wanted to ask about margins, and there are 2 parts to the question. So first, you reported margins, which continue to surprise. We've got 100 basis points or so with sequential improvement. I wanted to just ask, is this now a sustainable level? I know you call out the deconsolidation effect, but are there any temporary gains we need to adjust for with OpEx down now around $2 billion? And then the second part of it, and maybe it's more important, is this as good as it gets? Or do you think there's further potential for margins to improve as you get further product improvements over time?
Matt White: Tony, this is Matt. I could probably handle that and see if Sanjiv has any other input. So I think on the margins going up, yes, absolutely, we see it as sustainable. There's nothing temporary. And just to confirm, the deconsolidation had no effect on margins. Even if you look at the APAC in the appendix where we show kind of the effect, you can see the margins are pretty much the same. So the deconsolidation had no effect. And again, I'm referring to operating margins, obviously, as well here, operating profit. So we absolutely see it as sustainable. This is something that -- this is the hard work that everyone in the world is doing. This is about putting together quality business and making sure we run it efficiently and effectively. And as far as, as good as it gets, we get asked that question every quarter. But I would say this, and I've said it before, just look at the segments, right? When you look at the geographic segments of Americas, EMEA and APAC, there's nothing that is fundamentally different between those 3 segments. We do the same thing. It is a very homogeneous business. They supply across all 3 supply modes. They have end market distributions that aren't drastically different. So that kind of defines what the opportunity set is. And if you go back to 2018, Americas was 23%, EMEA was 17%. Now EMEA is over 25% and America is 28%. So you're seeing the improvement across the board, APAC as well, almost 25%, was 17%. This is part of what we're doing to run this business, and I don't see any temporary aspect. And I would say whichever segment is leading is kind of showing the way.
Sanjiv Lamba: The only thing that I'd add is actually both EMEA and APAC are heading for that Americas margin, right? They're pretty competitive guys out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicola Tang from Exane BNP Paribas.
Nicola Tang: First, I wanted to ask a little bit about the second half outlook. I know we completely hear you on sort of the volume assumption or the sort of lack of volume assumption, I suppose. But if I look at how you've guided, it sort of implies an H2 EPS growth of only about 5% versus, I don't know, 30-plus in the first half, which I was just thinking it seems a bit aggressive just thinking about the productivity gains that you just talked about and support from the buyback, I guess, even the FX tailwinds before you even think about volumes. So I was just wondering if there was anything I was missing there in terms of the H2 versus H1 dynamics on a year-on-year basis? And then the second question is on the other H2 on hydrogen. Thanks a lot for that detail on clean energy. Actually, again, I hear you in terms of the timing being uncertain and some of the opportunities being long dated. But when you look at those pipeline of projects that you're sort of evaluating, in which part of the sort of value chain in hydrogen are you seeing the most project proposals at the moment? Is it broad-based across the sort of production and the distribution and fueling end, or is it in a specific kind of activity?
Matt White: Okay. Nicola, it's Matt. I can take the first one, and Sanjiv will take the second. So as I mentioned in the pre remarks, we really -- we just didn't touch it. Obviously, there's a lot of companies not even giving guidance today. We have a very high degree of confidence in what we're laying out and that we can deliver on that. But as far as the second half right now, we felt we would just leave it alone, adjust the year for what we've demonstrated and our view on Q2. But rest assured, 3 months from now, we will update that back half. And as I mentioned, if conditions hold, well, then, yes, we're going to do better than this. Obviously, if they improve, we could also do better. But for now, we just felt we'll take it kind of quarter-by-quarter, a little bit of a wait-and-see approach. And therefore, I wouldn't really look into too much other than that on the second half at this point.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Matt. And Nicola, now moving on to the exciting H2 part of the question that you asked. So let me just take a step back and give you a sense of the projects we're looking at and then dive a little bit deeper and tell you where we see some of that kind of buildup that you were asking about. So we're evaluating at the moment between 210 to 220 opportunities individually. Some, as I mentioned, some very large megaprojects and down to the smaller ones as well. And we see, obviously, many of them progressing, some maybe not. And there'll be others that we will probably not want to do because they don't meet our investment criteria, so we'll be kind of selective about that as well. Now we see that spread focused in 2 specific areas primarily. I think mobility driving a lot is kind of well ahead, if you like, in its development. And then carbon capture and sequestration picking up, particularly in geographies which have oil and gas assets and, therefore, want to understand how best to manage the energy transition through this piece. To your exact point on which part of the value chain we see, I think in mobility, it tends to be a little bit of a balance between what we see around production versus distribution and dispensation. We have technologies across the entire value chain. So in many ways, we are really fortunate to have the ability to kind of be able to provide that holistic solution to our potential customers. On CCS, obviously, it tends to be a lot more on the production side, which is where the blue hydrogen piece, in particular, as a consequence of CCS, comes into play. I hope that gives you enough color to what you were asking for, Nicola.
Nicola Tang: Yes. Absolutely. That's great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: On the same point, just on -- you're looking at your project CapEx going forward, how much is focused on clean energy and/or hydrogen this year? And how do you think that will trend or increase over the next perhaps 3 to 5 years?
Matt White: David, this is Matt. So I think right now, there's very little to any. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, most of the clean energy are in the base CapEx. So those 3 projects we highlighted are all base CapEx. And to Sanjiv's point, you're seeing a lot in either areas of mobility. This is more distribution assets or assets around the density that we're building in certain areas. So that is something that when they do come into the backlog, obviously, we'll note that. But at this point, the vast majority of what we're doing right now is part of that growth in the base CapEx.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on merchant pricing, how much merchant pricing are you realizing this year? And given the inflation we're seeing overall, will that -- should that be increasing over the next few quarters going forward?
Sanjiv Lamba: So David, on merchant pricing, we're kind of seeing low to mid-single digits in -- across the different markets that we talk about typically. Americas and EMEA tend to lead, as you've seen from their pricing numbers, and APAC is a little bit behind. But they are hearing this call and they know that I'm looking to them to show some improvement sequentially in the next quarter as well. So we're kind of seeing across the board pricing kind of move up. Now your point on inflation, I think I mentioned this earlier as well, David. With inflation, our pricing will go up. That's been traditionally how we've seen our pricing move. And we are well prepared and there are -- there is enough conversation within the organization already in terms of how we will be managing that. So I'd expect to see with inflation, pricing continue to move in line.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: I wanted to just follow up on that one, if I could. The pricing in APAC, in particular, has kind of been flat at 1% for the last 4 quarters, even though at the beginning of that period, volumes were kind of down 9% and now they're up 10%. And I understand it's not a commodity business. But generally, when you're getting that kind of volume increase, asking for price gets a little bit easier. Is there something offsetting your ability to get price there, where maybe somebody who owns their own oxygen units is dumping more on the market as they're ramping up their steel production or something like that? So how should we think about APAC pricing in particular, given the strong volumes we're seeing there?
Sanjiv Lamba: Duffy, thanks for the question. I'm glad you asked it because my APAC team will be listening to this as well. So there is nothing structurally different that should fundamentally change the pricing targets that we've handed out to our teams over there. The market is a little bit different in terms of the distributor kind of model that is in some of the larger geographies over there. And in some cases, the level of on-site we have. But putting that aside for a moment, our view is pricing in APAC should hit the 2% target that we have as a corporation. And at the moment, I see progress happening. The 1% is disappointing. They know that. And my expectation is, sequentially, we'll see at least a 1% improvement in Q2, and I'm hoping to see 2% year-on-year in Q2 as well. So nothing -- there is nothing holding them back from that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: In listening to Matt's description of prices going up 2% but there being inflationary pressure, does that mean that the price cost benefit in the quarter was 0? That is, prices went up 2% and costs went up 2%? And secondly, do you have an update on your project with Exxon in Singapore? That is, have you begun to spend for that?
Matt White: Jeff, I can take the first one, and Sanjiv here will take the second one. So as you well know, the spread of our price less cost inflation of productivity is a very important metric that is part of our operating rhythm that we look at, at every country at the lowest levels of detail because that spread is very important, how we manage that spread as the compound decades go. And every country is different, right? Every country has different inflation profiles, but the spread is something we constantly look at. So given in the first quarter here, obviously, we have the price at the top of the house at 2%. On our cost front, they were lower, as you probably saw, especially on the fixed cost just due to some efficiencies we were able to achieve. We're also achieving efficiencies in the variable cost. So the spread was probably a little wider in this first quarter. But nevertheless, on a go-forward basis, we always have to make sure we manage that spread, and we feel quite confident in our ability to do it. And also the things, the large commodity inputs since we pass them through, they don't create as much issues on that as you might see in other types of industries. So for us, it's really managing a lot of the fixed costs and the operating costs and the SG&A, which is part of what we do with this rhythm.
Sanjiv Lamba: And Jeff, let me move on and talk a little bit about the Singapore project that you mentioned. So as far as our project is concerned, we have obviously been impacted by COVID on the schedule itself. But we have been executing the project. We've been spending on the project. We have commitments in place, and the project is currently underway. Our first modules, in fact, very large modules, have now reached the site and are in the staging area. So progress happening as we speak.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Sanjiv, you were talking about having a couple of hundred clean energy projects that you're looking at and you lay out a pretty clear case on the Slide 7 about Linde's expertise and capabilities in that whole supply chain. There's one area that I don't see mentioned that would seem to be an advantage for you, but I welcome your comment on that, and that is access to renewable power or maybe restated, the contracts that you have with power suppliers, it would suggest that you would have a meaningful advantage there in terms of electricity pricing from renewable power versus the many new entrants that are getting into this business. Can you comment on that?
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks, Steve. That's a great point you make. And actually, we should probably have mentioned that on that slide. So well suggested. There are -- the way we think about renewable power, and you're absolutely right. We are one of the largest consumers in most countries where we operate. And therefore, we have, if you like, the collective ability to go and have those conversations with our power suppliers. And now what tends to happen on renewable power, if I can just take a step back, is to tell you that the grid by itself and many of these suppliers, as a consequence of conversations that we're having with them, are actually moving and the level of renewable power within the grid itself is continuing to grow. So that's good that we are seeing action from these larger players. In addition to that, obviously, we then go out specifically and sign up PPAs with renewable power kind of developers who, in some cases on a one-on-one basis, in other cases on a shared basis, we would then get into long-term contracts with, often providing them support for their broader project as well. And in each one of these cases, because of our incumbency, we have well-established methodology as to how we get pricing on that renewable power, whether it's in the circumstances of a grid or whether it's on specific PPAs as well. So that is a competitive advantage, you're right. And obviously, our incumbency provides that, and it's something that we focus on quite a bit as we move ahead.
Matt White: Yes. And Steve, it's Matt. I can just add a few things as well. So as you may know, today, about 1/3 of our power is renewable already. So we've already been quite active in that space, and it's not something we built overnight. This has taken many years to get to that point. And as we mentioned, we will give a more wholesome ESG or fulsome, I should say, ESG update in the future. And this is an integral part of our ESG initiatives, especially around managing Scope 2 emissions is the renewable power effort. So this is something that we absolutely are actively doing. We have been doing for quite a long period of time, and we'll give further updates as it relates to that on our initiatives for ESG. And to your point, given our position, we are able to help these investments, and it's something we're actively working on and looking for today.
Steve Byrne: And can either of you comment on where you think you are in the achievement of the cost synergies that you initially laid out? With the merger with Praxair and Linde, do you think you've reached you're coming to the end of that process? Or do you think that you got a long way to go?
Matt White: Steve, there's never an end to being efficient and productive. So it is -- there is no end. It's something we have to continue to do and it's integrated to our culture. But as you know, we measure ourselves on our performance. How did we deliver? And that's always -- we gave you a number, as you know. But in the same token, we said, judge us on our performance. How do we expand margins? How do we grow EPS? How do we manage return on capital? How do we generate excess cash? How do we grow? Looking back in the 2 years, as we started this presentation, I think we've demonstrated, on a relative basis, that we've done a pretty good job. We've got a good start for the last couple of years. And so this is going to be the foundation for what we're going to continue to do going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: I wanted to dig into the release that you had put out the other day on the small on-site contracts for 2020 to maybe get a little bit more color around it. Can you speak to whether this was a lot of oxygen units for COVID or if it was more a sign that this recession is maybe a little bit different and the snapback from some of the smaller customers out there was maybe quicker? And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that, would you say that business is a little bit of a leading indicator for how we should be thinking about the larger scale projects and the demand for those?
Sanjiv Lamba: John, thanks for that question. I must admit that we are really proud of our small on-site portfolio. And something that we believe provides a really fulsome growth kind of opportunity for our businesses across the world. So there are a couple of ways to kind of look at that portfolio and see how that correlates to what we're seeing in the market. So we're seeing that growth not coming from COVID. There is no linkage to that at all. Most of these units are VPSA units, which are slightly lower purity, typically going into industrial processes. We do that for pulp and paper. We've seen a fair amount of growth in pulp and paper. We are seeing growth in some other segments -- ancillary segments around metals as well and glass and many others in fact. So I mean it is a widespread portfolio that supports a large number of different industries. I would say to you that it's a good pointer to industrial activity generally. I don't see a particular correlation for larger projects, if that was your question. But we do see this kind of correlate to industrial activity. And as people move, their consumption increases. These come into play.
Matt White: I was just going to add one quick point to that. I think it's probably a little bit to Steve's earlier question. I mean, as you know, we never gave revenue synergies. That was not something we committed a number to. But this area was an area where when we brought both companies together, it really filled out the product line portfolio of the small on-site plants. And this is an area where I think we've had a very strong execution given the combination of the technologies and capabilities from the merger of the company. And I think the success rate kind of speaks to that.
John McNulty: Got it. No, it makes sense. And I guess maybe, again, as a follow-up to that, when you -- I know normally -- I guess, if there is such a thing around recessions, it takes about 18 to 24 months for kind of the larger-scale projects, the project backlogs to start filling back up again. I guess, given the snapback that we've seen in a lot of the industrial economy, does it look like in the conversations that you're having, is that going to be a little more short-lived in terms of how long it takes to get that kind of flywheel working on the big projects again? How should we be thinking about that?
Sanjiv Lamba: So John, just kind of commenting briefly on the level of activity we are seeing because that, in many ways, is that leading indicator. So we're seeing proposal activity increasing. We're seeing that increasing in the U.S. We're seeing it increasing across Asia. I think about China, South Korea, India, a couple of the ASEAN markets as well. So we're seeing a lot more projects. Now, a part of these projects are electronics. You've heard me talk about electronics before, what a strong growth we've seen in the quarter. And my expectation is that we will see a lot more of electronic project growth happen as we see these new fab buildups happen as well. They are progressing well. They are all on track, and you've seen a number of announcements, I'm sure, from TSMC, Samsung, Intel and so on and so forth. So those are all looking to be on track and part of that activity. I also have to say that the other piece I'm a little more -- I'm a little more positive on is the more traditional markets, steel, chemicals, refining, also project activity actually picking up over there as we see. So I'm not going to comment particularly on if we are seeing potentially this as a snapback. I see this as fundamental underlying activity picking up and translating them into projects that people are pursuing, and we are getting a chance to participate in.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale.
Peter Clark: I've got 2 questions. First one for Sanjiv, I think. About the productivity being embedded, obviously, in the PLC. Is the story now on productivity more about not adding costs back if the volumes continue to grow rather than savage cost cutting as such? Because I did notice, obviously, Q4 -- we'll get the Q1 numbers later in terms of the headcount and the severance costs. But they did slow, obviously, in the fourth quarter from the pace earlier in the year. And then for Matt, on the cash flow, I mean, the Q1 performance now is what we would normally see in the legacy companies, usually in Q4, which is normally the strongest quarter. I'm just wondering how that progresses through the year, given that you always make more money in the second half?
Sanjiv Lamba: Peter, thanks. I'm going to give you a quick view on productivity. So you've heard me say this before, and I think Matt kind of made a very good observation earlier on, which is that we are always going to be very, very focused on managing our cost base. Our total cash fixed cost is something we kind of discuss every month at the business reviews that we carry out. So adding cost back is something we kind of manage actively. I think it doesn't necessarily translate into productivity because for productivity, we want to see that incremental action as well, which makes it tough. But it is in the DNA of the organization, Peter, and you've heard me talk kind of passionately about the fact that every individual in our organization has got a mandate to go out and look for productivity every day. It's thousands of projects, which add small benefits but actually flow into the entire productivity part that we put together. There's one other thing which I think is now enabling that or helping us accelerate that, and that's around digitalization. And again, hopefully, you've heard me speak about this as well before. We're using digitalization, not as a significant tool that's going to create Earth-shattering new discoveries for us, but it's something that we apply in our business to deal with pain points every day. Our organizational model is embedded within the organization. So digital kind of expertise is being built up within every business across the world, and we are encouraging them. And in fact, I track it every quarter to ask them what percentage of productivity is coming from digital work or initiatives that we put in place. So that is an enabler that I see in actually ensuring our productivity stays on track. Matt?
Matt White: Yes. And so Peter, on the cash, yes, pretty solid Q1 cash. I think starting with -- when I think about operating cash flow kind of as a percentage of our EBITDA, we were almost high 80s this quarter. Normally, to your point, Q1 is seasonally lower. So I think it's a combination of a few things. I mean first of all, obviously, with EPS growing at 32%, half of the benefit just came from earnings. So as we continue to have strong earnings growth, that should flow right through the cash flow. The other half of the year-over-year improvement was mostly working capital as we had nets everywhere else. And we're just seeing strong performance around the world in terms of collections, management of payables, inventory, just managing the asset and liability base quite well. Engineering had a very strong working capital performance as well as they continue to manage their projects incredibly well under different -- difficult circumstances. As you look forward into the second half, I think it should just be a continuation of an earnings driven with tight working capital management efforts. So If we can continue to see kind of the strong results, that should flow through to cash. I mean cash is an integral part of our compensation. It's something that we track very diligently each month, and we're seeing the benefits, I think, of that effort, and we should continue to see the benefits of that effort looking forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Haire from UBS.
Geoff Haire: Just 2 quick questions. First of all, I was just wondering if, Matt, if you could help us sort of think about what your pricing assumptions are within the guidance for the second half of the year? And then also, obviously, you had very strong pricing in Europe and North America relative to at least one of your peers. I was just wondering what was driving that and how sustainable that is.
Matt White: Yes, Geoff. So probably as stated before, I guess, 2 points. Number one, we fully continue to expect to price to weighted inflation. And since the second half guidance, we really didn't touch, it would be based on kind of a 3-month ago view. But as you know, last quarter, we had about a 2% pricing. This quarter, 2% pricing. Now you don't see the first decimal, but we are seeing a bit of improvement as inflation kind of picks up. But that's what the expectation would be. Just continue to price to the weighted inflation is what our views are when we look forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Just wanted to follow up on the green hydrogen discussion. I heard sort of very clear and very confident point of view on the opportunity set and, in particular, that it would be in excess of the 10% compounding that you anticipate sort of from the core business. And I guess I just want to better understand, as we think about sort of our CapEx that we're putting in our models in the sort of the medium to long term, how much do you think that would scale up and overall, what implications that would have to broader capital allocation?
Matt White: Vince, it's Matt. So I think a couple of things. First, as we mentioned, right now, the vast majority of these projects are falling under base CapEx. And we would anticipate to continue to see growth in base CapEx primarily around either distribution, infrastructure-type assets to support and some production assets, whether it be electrolyzers or other kinds of hydrogen -- smaller hydrogen-producing assets. So from that perspective, I would model that 40% or more growth portion of the base CapEx might accelerate related to these initiatives. If there are any backlog projects, they would likely be announced in terms of being additions to the backlog. But I would say from a CapEx spend and benefit, we're not changing our investment criteria, it's the same. How we approach these is the same. And so I would just model it, just like Sanjiv said, it's incremental to the greater than 10% EPS growth rate that we're looking to do. And what we find and can add into this should be accretive to that over the coming years here.
Vincent Andrews: So we don't need to take a CapEx forecast into the high $3 billion or anything like that?
Matt White: No, that would only happen as a function of any large projects. And I think from that perspective, we'll see. If they meet our investment criteria, yes. But that's something that we'd mentioned that we've got over 200 projects we're evaluating. And when we meet our investment criteria, we'll spend, and we should want to spend that CapEx. But we've shown, I think, with our metrics, that we keep our discipline and keep our approach, we should get the right growth and the right results.
Operator: And we'll take our last question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.
Kevin McCarthy: Matt, in your prepared remarks, you made a comment that April results exceeded your internal expectations. I was wondering if you could comment on what accounted for that variance, if anything stood out in terms of region or end-use market? And then secondly, if I may, you mentioned Uri was a drag on sales. What was that drag? And how did you insulate the profit from being impactful? I appreciate you have contracts, but I would have thought maybe there would be a slight impact in your merchant and/or packaged gas business. I'm wondering if you just simply recover by the end of March or if you're able to offset through electricity sales or otherwise.
Matt White: Kevin, it's Matt. I can do the first one and Sanjiv will take the second one. So my comment related to April, it was fairly broad-based. I would say, for the most part, what we've been seeing is recovery in developed markets on an industrial front. Some developing markets are still, in some areas, going through some challenges. But the expectation is probably by the back end of the quarter, we hope to see some industrial activity rebounding. But I would say it's, for the most part, incremental industrial activity, especially in certain developed markets that you're seeing in North America, especially places like Asia. It's really what's driving it, pretty much a continuation of what we've been seeing.
Sanjiv Lamba: And Kevin, moving on to Uri then and just kind of briefly giving you a sense. So again, I think it's a good opportunity for me to just mention that our team in Texas did an outstanding job. They've managed to ensure that we shut down and started up safely, quickly. We were able to support our customers. And even in some cases, some of the players who are not our customers to just make sure that they remain safe and helping them with their start-ups as well. So our customers really have actually started up and are operational now, whether it's refineries, chemicals, all of them back online. And we're seeing volumes back to pre-COVID levels in some cases as well, particularly on the chemical side. Our bulk customers, again, I think we saw a quick turnaround over there post the winter freeze and again, with some support from us, our customers are back up and running. We see levels back to January already in that space as well. Refinery is probably the most specific one where you know that they have a longer lead time to startups. Even there, we were quite pleased to see that they were up and running in 3 or 4 weeks. And today, hydrogen volumes are about 12%. I think they're about higher than where we were earlier in the year. So again, it's been pretty good in terms of how that overall piece has been managed. I guess the point that the guys in Texas said to me, which I think holds here as well, is we're used to seeing storms, hurricanes, freezes. This is not new. This is something that we work on every year, and we've got a team that fully understands that and getting plants back online is significantly important, making sure our customers have the product available to keep them safe and ready to go. Now contractually, obviously, we are well protected, as you've just remarked. So that's one of the reasons we don't see a significant exposure, while we see some top line movement. But again, from March to April, we've seen that uplift come back fairly quickly as well.
Operator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Juan Pelaez for any closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Crystal, thank you. And everyone on the line, thank you very much for participating today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out. Have a great rest of your day. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-05 10:00:00) =====
Presentation:
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2020 Linde Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Juan Pelaez: Chrystal, Thank you. And good morning, everyone, and appreciating attending our 2020 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Chief Financial Officer; and Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Operating Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Steve and Matt will now give an update on Linde's fourth quarter performance, and we'll then be available to answer questions. Steve?
Steve Angel: Thank you, Juan. The entire team responded exceptionally well in a year dominated by COVID. Our frontline workers in particular deserve special recognition for what they accomplished and what they continue to do for our customers, our patients and our communities. Despite the challenges of Covid, our key safety metrics continue to trend positively. We always say safety first here at Linde and our people certainly walk the talk in 2020. We ramped up our health care capabilities around the world. We develop new protocols to treat COVID patients and their homes freeing our needed capacity and overburdened hospitals. Since March we had treated 90,000 COVID homecare patients and unfortunately that number continues to grow. And we did that while caring for our existing base of some 1.6 million homecare patients. We kept our plants running reliably and maintain service to our customers. We started up new plants in challenging circumstances with minimal delays. With the help of virtual tools, we transition from central to distributed operations almost flawlessly. In light of the inequalities in our society exposed by COVID-19, we contributed an additional 1.5 million to our communities beyond our normal level of giving. We demonstrated the resiliency of our business model. We quickly adjusted cost structures in line with local market conditions. We utilize our strong commercial terms and conditions to shield us from volume disruptions. We capitalize on more resilient growth opportunities in healthcare, electronics and food freezing. We delivered strong financial performance for the full year. Matt will provide more detail on the financials but let me share a few highlights. Ex-FX we deliver 13% earnings per share growth on minus 2% sales. Our EBIT percent rose 260 basis points to 21.3%. Gross operating cash flow grew 21% to $7.4 billion. And the single most important metric to me return on capital grew 180 basis points to 13.4%. We run significant projects serving new semiconductor fabs, the largest of which has yet to be announced and is not yet included in the $3.6 billion Sale of Gas backlog number you see in the presentation. We won 36 Mall on site projects in growing markets such as pulp and paper, lithium ion batteries, and precious metals. We advanced our sustainability initiative. We are the only chemical company in the world who has been recognized in the world Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 18 consecutive years. And MSCI recent we upgraded our ESG rating to an A rating. This time last year we announced a new greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction goal of 35% by 2028. At this point, we're nearly halfway to achieving this goal. And we continue to develop applications that enable our customers to address their environmental challenges. We're currently working on several carbon capture utilization and sequestration projects that we expect to come to fruition in the coming months. We made progress on our clean hydrogen initiative. We wrapped up our JV with ITM to build PEM, Proton Exchange Membrane electrolysis plants; we formed a dozen partnerships with fuel cell electric vehicle manufacturers, energy companies, and renewable power producers. We closed several important projects in China, South Korea and Germany. We made significant progress on our diversity goals for women globally and minorities in the US. We conducted our second employee engagement survey, and the results were very positive and improved year-over-year. We maintain a strong compliance program. Establishing a strong culture of compliance is a fundamental responsibility of every leader in our company. We didn't ring a bell or anything. But the merger integration is over, thanks to the outstanding work of many people from both legacy companies. In short, we accomplished a great deal in 2020 and performed at an exceptional level, especially when considering the environment. Now I've just made a lot of we statements. And now I have one more. We are well positioned for another outstanding year in 2021. Now I'll turn it over to Sanjiv to provide more details on the business trends and outlook.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. As Steve mentioned we had a strong finish to a challenging year. However, not all end markets have recovered and growth rates have been quite varied. Given the current uncertainty around the shape and speed of the economic recovery, I'd like to walk through the current business conditions. The key trends by end market that you can find on the next slide slide 4. This slide represents our global end market sales, excluding engineering source for the last quarter. And the first point I'd like to make to you over here is that our sale are well balanced, about 40% in resilient markets, like healthcare, electronics, food and beverage, and the other 60% in cyclical end markets, such as metals, manufacturing, chemicals and refining. Clearly, the resilient end markets provided both stability and earnings accretion throughout the year. These growth rates are more aligned with demographic and consumer trends, and of course, incremental application technology. This is especially true for merchant and packaged supply modes. In fact, our strategic focus towards developing an integrated supply network across all three supply modes of on site, merchants and package enables us to efficiently serve all these customers. In healthcare, which is about 20% of our sales, we continue to make considerable investments around the world to serve patients in both hospitals and homes. We have expanded our medical grade oxygen capacity. We've introduced inhaled nitric oxide alternatives in the United States and Canada provided specialty gases for research and drug discovery, and of course, increased co2 supply for dry ice production for the storage and transportation of vaccine.  Furthermore, we've been better prepared our homecare organization to safely and reliably care for millions of high risk patients right through this pandemic. It is of course difficult to say how much longer we'll face these challenges. But I can say with some confidence that we will continue to do our part to support and care for our customers.  Moving on to food and beverage which comprises 10% of global sales, now this end market includes production and distribution for both out products and retail. Growth trends have been more prominent in both food freezing, dry ice for transport, and specific trends like oxygen for aquaculture co2 for greenhouses. I anticipate these trends will continue based on the rise of food delivery services, concentration of food production stuff, and of course a growing demand for high quality ready to eat meals. Now, although the beverage market has been negatively impacted, particularly by the closure of restaurants, especially in North America and the UK that business has partially recovered through diner takeout trends that we see, along with increased bottler demand. Overall, we see this as a stable market, with some upside when there is return to restaurant dining. Moving on to electronics, which is 10% of our sales. We also consider this a resilient market since it tracks closely to consumer trends rather than industrial cycle. And also because we supply critical products, such as high purity nitrogen, and specialty gases and complex mixtures. Now these products enable our customers to make smaller and increasingly more powerful electronic devices irrespective of their technology platform. This is of course one of our fastest growing markets, both in the Americas and Asia Pacific, as more investments are made into these integrated circuitry, memory, display, and solar panels. Some recent examples of onsite project wins include the recently announced Samsung win in South Korea, and there are other tier one fabs in Taiwan, China and Singapore as well. In fact, this is a market where I expect that most project backlog opportunities in 2021. And as we are, of course pursuing actively a large number of projects that should result in an additional win or wins being announced this year itself. Overall resilience end markets provide a healthy foundation for future growth, while offering downside protection as evidenced by our financial performance during 2020. Let me move on to the bottom half of the slide, slide 4 that shows the cyclical markets. Some of those you can see are denoted in yellow, since they were negatively affected by the economic downturn especially in Americas and EMEA. But many of these markets are underpinned by fixed fee payments such as onsite contracts in metals and chemicals, or cylinder rental payments and manufacturing. Gas volumes are however exposed to industrial growth trends. Of course, this is also the part of our portfolio that will see the most leverage the recovery in the economy. Metal and glass represents about 13% of our sales. Carbon steel production has been increasing in China, but of course, a lot more volatile in developed markets like Europe and the US, especially when those mills are linked to auto production. However, quarter four saw some of the highest in 2020 due to catch up demand after pandemic production shutdowns and of course, depletion of inventory and steel mills as well as end customers. We're also seeing some recent trends in the space including the efforts to decarbonize steel production, such as the use of oxy fuel combustion to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency. We also see recovery in flat steel from a rebound in auto production. Of course, if we see any significant infrastructure stimulus spending, the metals industry will definitely benefit. We, of course, continue to have confidence in our portfolio of high quality customer assets, which have successfully navigated economic headwinds for many decades. Moving on to chemicals and refining that represents 19% of our sales globally, and is well balanced across the different segments. Now similar to metals, we have focused efforts on partnering with high quality assets. And therefore our customers are some of the lowest cost producers in the world. Production activity for 2020 ended below pre pandemic levels. But so far this year, we've seen refining capacity, utilization trend up to low 80s in the US. The Gulf Coast refining system is a well integrated and still has some of the lowest cost feedstock in the world. Our current chemicals and refining backlog of projects are leading global companies and protected with strong contractual terms. We have recently announced and we signed a new project with Wanhuain Hungary. And of course continue to explore new opportunities as our customers work to reduce their carbon footprint. A good example of this is the increasing trends in biofuel production, requiring additional hydrogen for hydrotreating and hydroprocessing. So while 2020 represented a challenging year for these customers, we see upside potential heading into 2021. Then we move on to manufacturing, which at 19% contains a variety of markets including aviation, automotive, falcon paper, and general manufacturing, but also some growth market like commercial spaceflight. Now overall trends have been down due to weaker general manufacturing. As many small to medium sized manufacturing customers have to shut up from operations for extended periods. And while aviation has decreased with overall travel industry, we continue to see strong growth in commercial spaceflight, albeit of a very small base. In addition, we've seen falcon paper customers add more capacity to serve consumer retail demand, which has enabled more small onsite oxygen plant win, that especially true in Latin America and Northern Europe. But for most part, manufacturing end markets correlate with industrial production, and thus would be expected to move up or down with those threats. For the overall gases business, we have a good balance of both resilient and cyclical end markets. 2020 has already demonstrated the downside protection and stability in our business. And while we remain somewhat cautious in our outlook, we are well positioned to leverage any recovery in 2021. Let me move on to engineering. Our engineering segment represents approximately 10% of our consolidated sales. It's a longer cycle business so quarterly trends don't quite provide the full story. The last year was a culmination of a multiyear growth trend for order intake, most of that primarily related to gas processing, and petrochemical expansions. So for 2021, we estimate a net decrease in the sale of equipment backlog from a lower capital cycle spends. However, as clean energy projects continue to develop, I expect these to steadily become a larger part of the engineering portfolio. Irrespective of the near-term outlook, we have a high degree of confidence in the sustainability of long-term margins and cash generation in this business, driven by a captive sale of gas opportunities, unrivaled technology portfolio, and focus on higher quality engineering and services. So let me wrap up by sharing some of my priorities for 2021. On safety and compliance, which is always first in Linde, we must maintain a best in class performance, and a culture with continuous improvement across all our KPIs. For sustainability, we must further progress in the goals we set last year. In particular, our focus will be on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions intensity, and of course increasing gender diversity. Price and Cost Management is a hallmark of Linde, we will build upon the current best practices on pricing and productivity, while also remaining laser focused on cash management. We will also remain quite nimble adjusting each local business to its environment for optimal results, yet always remaining prepared to capture any growth opportunities that create our investment criteria. I'm sure you've heard us say in the past, ROC is a truth serum for any capital intensive industry. And I truly believe that. We've instilled a culture of Linde where capital isn't free, where we have to be good stewards of shareholder capital. And to do so we need to continuously optimize our base CapEx while also pursuing all good investment opportunities. That means projects, acquisitions and Decaps as well. Our approach to growth remains disciplined. We will pursue all growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria. Double digit, unlevered, after tax IRR with reputable customers who have competitive assets and in regions where we have confidence we can enforce our contracts. For such opportunities that we target I'm confident we will win more than our fair share. Thus we continue to improve the numerator, the after tax operating profit and maintain a long term and disciplined approach to investing. I expect to see our ROC continue to grow.  With that, I'd now hand over to Matt who will take you through the financial results and guidance. Matt?
Matt White: Thanks, Sanjiv. Please turn to slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter results. Sales of $7.3 billion were 3% above last year, and 6% higher sequentially, year-over-year gas volume trends have started to stabilize, with an increase of 1% from 2019. This is driven by contribution from the project backlog as most of our customers have started up as anticipated. Organic volumes were stable with prior year, as increases from electronics and healthcare were mostly offset by slight declines in manufacturing and refining. Sequentially, volumes increased across all geographic segments and most end markets. The engineering business drove a 1% decrease in sales from prior year. As this is a longer cycle business, so quarterly trends are less indicative of overall conditions. Currently, projects are being completed faster than order intake, thus resulting in a slightly lower backlog of $4.7 billion, which is about 1.5x to 2x annualized sales. Despite the lower fourth quarter sales, the team improved EBIT margin 110 basis points, and ended the full year with margins above 15%. Looking ahead, we expect engineering EBIT margins to average low double digit percent throughout the cycle.  Pricing remains healthy at 2% as most business units are keeping up with local inflation. Proper contract management is an integral part of our operating model and therefore provides long-term confidence in the ability to maintain positive pricing in any environment. Foreign currency was a 2% tailwind, as the US Dollar weakened against most currencies in APAC, and EMEA, although the Americas still has a headwind due to weaker Latin American currencies. The combination of stable volumes, higher pricing and strong productivity and cost management resulted in operating profit of $1.6 billion, which is 20% above last year. But 22.2% margin is 320 basis points above 2019 and represents our sixth consecutive quarter of expanding operating margins more than 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $2.30 increased 22% from prior year and 7% sequentially. The incremental growth rate versus operating profit is primarily due to the lower share count. Operating cash flow of $2.4 billion was our highest quarter yet ending at 12% above last year, and 29% above the third quarter. In fact, it represents another quarter where the operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio exceeded 100%. We had a strong finish in working capital, especially in the engineering segment, but I'll speak more to that on the next slide. CapEx of $1 billion was 1% above last year and 30% higher sequentially. As a reminder, project CapEx represents opportunities over $5 million in spend with returns supported by long-term contracts. These projects often take three or more years to build so spending patterns fluctuate from construction and delivery timing. Therefore, a better indicator is the sale of gas project backlog which stands at $3.6 billions similar to the third quarter.  Base CapEx has increased from both periods, primarily due to quality growth investments that meet our return criteria, but not all requirements to be included in the project backlog. Example investments include small onsite, specialty gas plants, hydrogen mobility, and expanding medical gas capacity. Ultimately, all capital decisions roll up to ROC, which continues to trend in the right direction with Q4 ending at 13.4%. You can see a continual improvement from substantial earnings growth on a stable capital base. As Sanjiv mentioned, we as management are stewards of shareholder capital. So this metric is the best way to define long-term success in deploying that capital. To build off that, I'd like to spend some time reviewing the full year 2020 capital management on slide 6. As you can see, on the left side, full year operating cash increased 21%. This was driven by a combination of higher earnings, lower merger costs, and better working capital management. Cash from operations grew steadily over the two year period despite the challenges related to the pandemic, including the second and third quarters of 2020. The right side represents how that capital was deployed. Linde has a stable and predictable cash allocation approach irrespective of any short-term disruptions around the world. The underlying mandate is an A credit rating with a growing dividend each year. In fact, just two weeks ago, we announced a 10% dividend increase for 2021 to mark our 28th consecutive year of increasing dividends. Our capital priority is to invest back into the business. It can be for projects, Decaps or acquisitions. We view them equally under our consistent investment criteria. All growth must meet a proper risk reward balance. Because mistakes in this industry can result in long-term losses that exceed the initial investment. During 2020, $3.5 billion met our investment standards, and I expect this number to increase over time. Finally, any excess cash leftover after dividends and investments is used for stock repurchases. And you can see that number was $2.4 billion for 2020. We recently approved a new $5 billion stock repurchase program, which further validates our confidence in the ability to generate significant excess cash flow. The path to long term compound value generation requires annual growth of earnings and cash flow with a consistent, disciplined capital deployment model for both a good and challenging years. Furthermore, building local density in diverse end markets provides Linde downside protection with significant leverage to grow cycles. 2020 validated the resilience of this model in a tough year, and we look forward to demonstrating how we can perform in a recovery. I'll now wrap up with guidance, which you can find on slide 7. Initial EPS outlook for full year 2021 is $9.10 to $9.30. This represents an 11% to 13% growth rate with an estimated 1% FX tailwind. Excluding FX the 10% to 12% range assumes minimal economic benefit at the bottom end and a low single digit economic growth at the top end. In other words and consistent with prior statements, we have confidence we can grow EPS double digit percent with minimal help from the economy. And while we don't provide revenue guidance, I do want to mention for modeling purposes, that effective January 1, we have deconsolidated, a 50% joint venture in the APAC segment. Our ownership and economic interest remained the same. However, we had some incremental shareholder rights that expired in December which both parties agreed not to renew. The effect of this deconsolidation will be shown as a divestiture and we'll reduce annualized sales approximately $600 million at average op margins. Note this change will not affect EPS due to the proportional increase in equity income. Stated simply, this is merely an accounting change that will not impact our economic benefits. Turning to the first quarter, we are providing EPS guidance of $2.20 to $2.25, or 16% to 19% growth rate, including an assumed 2% FX tailwind. This range assumes a normal seasonal decline from the fourth quarter, including Chinese New Year and Brazilian carnival. At this point, we are not assuming any meaningful improvement in sequential volumes from Q4. And while we started 2021, with a stronger January than anticipated, we're not in a position to update guidance at this time. Consistent with prior quarters, we believe it's prudent to remain cautious on the outlook as the pandemic evolves. But rest assured if there is any economic upside, we will capture more than our fair share, as demonstrated by the second half of 2020. And if the economy does improve more than our baseline assumptions, we will likely be at the upper end or above this guidance range. I'd like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
BobKoort: Thank you very much. Good morning. I wanted to ask a bit about the forward looking to 2021 in context, obviously did a tremendous job in 2020 on a cost basis, I think your operating profits climbed over $500 million and your sales are actually down almost a $1 billion. So you had -- you broke the calculator on the incremental margins. How should we think about it going into 2021? And what might underlie that earnings output that you guided us towards is in terms of a sales evolution relative to an EBIT evolution. And these are operating profit and do you see some of the expenses that maybe were diminished in 2020, rolling back in 2021, as the world moves towards a more normal business operating condition.
SteveAngel: Okay, thanks, Bob. This is Steve. Thanks for the question. First of all, I need to give a shout out to my daughter today. It's her 30th birthday. So Happy Birthday, Logan. She only cares about the share price by the way she won't be listening in. So Bob, as we think about continuing to expand margins. Obviously, that's in our sights that are built into our plans. We're given clear guidance on double digit earnings growth. And as Matt described, even at the low end, there's no real volume expectation and at the higher end, there's a low single digit volume expectation. So obviously, we're going to lever up the EBIT quite a bit off of a pretty small volume assumption, and then we'll lever that further through share buybacks; and I didn't really go back and calculate the number, but clearly, it's going to be another significant move. That's the plan in terms of EBIT margin expansion, and I think, as Matt probably said a couple times we don't really know what's going to happen this year. I mean, we are looking at January, obviously, the results are pretty encouraging. One month doesn't make a quarter and one month certainly doesn't make a year so we certainly have to be a little more cautious in terms of what could happened in the second half of the year.
MattWhite: And Bob, this is Matt, I'll just add one thing to that as well, I mean, long range, we look at the equation of price, productivity cost inflation to be in accretive component to how we think about our earnings and our margins on a go forward basis. So this is beyond the merger. This is beyond anything like that. We don't anticipate temporary cost savings that popped back or anything to that extent, as we've discussed in prior calls. So we see this as a compound value opportunity, as Steve mentioned, and this doesn't assume much volume help at all, at this stage on the organic, obviously, we will have our backlog volume. And then we'll just have to see what happens to the economy, we will take it quarter-by-quarter, and we'll keep giving updates as they occur. But January was better than what we expected. And we'll just have to see how it plays out in the next two months. And we'll give you another update come our next call.
BobKoort: And can I ask a hydrogen question, you're building the PEM electrolyzer in Luna. And I assume some of that gets shoved into your pipeline network. How do you distinguish sales prices for green versus mingled hydrogen through that pipeline to your customer base?
SteveAngel: Well, I mean, we obviously think coming off the electrolyzer that volume that we're selling through the pipeline system to some existing chemical customers. And we can identify those molecules that are not a problem. It's clearly at a premium, a substantial premium. And just while you're on that point, talking about, this project, this is kind of the quintessential industrial gas supply project where we have multiple modes of supply in one targeted geography which is in Luna. So we have gas molecules going down the pipeline, as we just discussed, we have gas molecules that will be going into tube trailers, to supply train stations to supply buses. We're liquefying some of those molecules to distribute to trucking and general industry. So it really is a typical integrated supply system. It just happens to be around green hydrogen this time. And it's in a location where we already have a strong presence to your point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nicola Tang from Exane BNP Paribas.
NicolaTang: Hi, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. And I want to ask a little bit about the backlog. I think back in Q3, you were flagging that actually, the backlog might decline to 2021, just related to capital cycle corrections, but you actually sound quite upbeat today thinking about the opportunities. And if I looked at your CapEx guide for 2021, it looks kind of flat versus 2020. So I was wondering if you actually seen better project activity than you initially expected? Or are you setting up the base CapEx perhaps. And then within the double digit EPS guide, could you kind of give us a steer for how much is driven by new project startups? And then sort of tagged on to this, if I can squeeze it in? On electronics, again, it sounds like you're pretty upbeat there in terms of opportunities. Can I ask whether the sort of current situation with the semiconductor bottlenecks is impacting you in any way with a plus 8% growth in the quarter and also, whether you think that this could drive acceleration in new investments going forward? Thanks.
SteveAngel: Okay. So backlog contribution, 2% is kind of, I think the right number you should use kind of 2% on the top 2% on the bottom. And that's really kind of been our ongoing rate. We have fairly strong CapEx startups, lineup of startups in 2021. Of course, it's during different times a year, so you don't get all the contributions in 2021. They tend to roll over. It's always difficult to talk about what you think a year end backlog number is going to be because it's really a function of, you know what you've got in front of you that you're going to book and I certainly alluded to a very large project that we're looking forward to talk telling you more about in the not too distant future. But what happens during the remainder of the year is kind of a function of, I'd say, the pace of clean energy projects, maybe the pace of electronics projects. If demand comes back that generally provides projects for we see more project activity, more of our traditional industries, like petrochemical and metals, but that kind of -- we have to kind of wait and see. There's not much going on obviously in that latter category at this point, it's more around electronics and clean energy. So the CapEx spend is pretty consistent. Again, it doesn't move that much, unless the backlog really starts to drop year-over-year-over-year, then you'd see that large project spend continued to drop. The base CapEx is more consistent. There's lots of little growth opportunities inside of that I said 33 or 36 Mall on site that we booked in 2020. There we have a very strong focus on that we like those projects. There are good opportunities in some of these markets that Sanjiv alluded to that we'll spend some CapEx against to capitalize on that growth. So yes, I do think semiconductors will continue to be a very strong opportunity. Sanjiv talked about that in his comments as well. It's how we work today, virtually, it's the Internet of Things, it's chips that are going to go on everything, especially in automobiles. So semiconductor opportunity is going to be very strong. We've been talking about this for two years; we're well positioned in places like South Korea, Taiwan and China, which is really kind of the axis of where all the semiconductor fabs have been built. There is some new activity; obviously, the US is trying to go more prime in terms of having domestic semiconductor fabrication. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
DavidBegleiter: Thank you. Good morning, Steve can you discuss how your refining and inhaling businesses have improved of the pandemic?
SteveAngel: Well, I think with respect to helium, I mean, it's down year-over-year, we did see some sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4, we'll kind of have to wait and see what happens this time in coming out of January and during the quarter, but if you kind of look at some of the elements of that, there's a significant piece that's electronics, obviously, that's going to do well. I think the industrial volumes will kind of move as the industry recovers. Balloons are clearly down have been down will continue to be down and I don't have to explain why. And then there's a piece of it for us that's also tied to MRI that looks kind of stable to maybe slightly up. So it looks to me like there's going to be sequential improvement. Not at a rapid pace but certainly sequential improvement on volumes going forward. I would say in terms of refinery volumes what I look at is hydrogen. Clearly in Q4, we're down something like 7% or so year-over-year. So up a little bit from Q3. And starting off in January, I'm looking at like January versus December, and I'm seeing plus 8% kind of numbers on volume. So they are starting to improve. I think you know what the drivers are behind their end markets clearly jet fuel is very weak, still diesel a bit strong, gasoline is weaker. And what one would have to expect is as you get deeper into the year and COVID gets behind is particularly in places like the US that you would see hydrogen volumes improve and should improve considerably. We also have some new project startups that will augment that. And then if you get into like liquid hydrogen volumes, which aren't necessarily tied with refining but some piece might go into biofuels. That's a pretty -- that's on a pretty positive trend itself. So that's kind of the status of our volume to the refining industry is still down year-over-year. But starting to see some improvement, I would expect that to improve -- could quite a bit in the back half of the year.
DavidBegleiter: Very good. And just lastly on share buybacks, you announced a new $5 billion program last month. How should we think about the level of buybacks in 2021?
MattWhite: David, yes, this is Matt, I can answer that. So as you saw, we did $2.4 billion net in 2020. And so we're going to continue to sweep the excess cash that we have, and we'll be buying back. Our expectation is we'll be in the market every day. And then when we see opportunities, we may go heavier. That's kind of how we normally play that out. But the $5 billion program, we had to put an expiration date on it as required for Europe. So we just put something out there and kind of July of 2023. But we'll continue to execute and use our excess cash and we'll be in the market daily.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale.
PeterClark: Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Hey, times abate. Well done. Just a quick question for you Steve to begin with. On return on capital, you say obviously the most important metric, you are up, I think over 300 basis points now at 13.4%. If I go back about 10 years ago, Praxair hit the peak of 14.7%. Any reason with the platform you have now with Linde PLC, why we can't see that continued to grow up to that sort of level. And then following on from that a very interesting announcement with Afrox. We're obviously you've delisted; you're talking about the opportunities here. I know it's relatively small in the context of Linde PLC, but the operating margin there looks sort of mid- teens level for a clear leader in the market, just wondering your thoughts within the context of what you do on efficiency and productivity, for what sort of an example of what you can do in a business like that. Thank you.
SteveAngel: Yes, sure, Peter thanks for the questions. Yes, you're correct. I remember those numbers as well as you do, I didn't have to go look at them to know what we and Praxair once operated, which was pushing 15%. I don't see the reason why this business can't do that, as well. Continue to grow earnings kind of a double digit range. That obviously does a lot to drive the top line and being very efficient in terms of how we allocate capital below the line, and we continue to get a little better at that all the time, continuing to invest in good return projects, again, I see no, I'm not going to call it. And somebody told me a long time ago, you give them a number or a date, but don't give them a number and a date. So it goes back to my GE days. But I don't know when what year that's going to be but something that's clearly in our sights. And 30% of our long-term incentive is tied to return on capital. So we have the highest weighting and our LTI. So I'm not the only one that thinks that's an important metric. I think we have 1000s of people, I see Sanjiv smiling that we all know it's the same. Afrox is just is an example of our view in terms of portfolio optimization. I don't like joint ventures, normally speaking, I think, especially for traditional industrial gas businesses. And this was a case this company had a public float. So you could imagine the distractions that go with having a small business in a country like that with a public float. And so by essentially eliminating the public float buying all those shares, and being able to run that country, just like any other country that we operate around the globe, we can focus on all the things that we know are important, which is making that business better every day. Price management efficiency, and there's quite a bit of opportunity and continue to grow cash flow being very prudent with capital, working capital, safety compliance, it's the same list for every country. So I'm pretty confident that we're going to see a pretty nice step up in that case, but there are other examples of that too, that clearly are is on our target list of places that we want to I'll say season control, so we can run them the way we think they should be run.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
JeffZekauskas: Thanks very much. Your cost of goods sold was down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. And your revenues were up. I don't know a couple $100 million. Can you explain that? And secondly, when you look across your divisions; which is the division, which is the geographic area with the most margin opportunity from here going forward?
SteveAngel: All of them. I'm going to, I think I really -- I think Asia certainly has some opportunities. I know Sanjiv would agree with that he made a lot of progress in a very short period of time, but he would see more going forward. I think in EMEA, I mean, certainly at 25% EBIT, you probably surprised some people with the quality of that performance. But we have more work to do there. And we've really kind of just been getting into running EMEA the way that, we know an industrial gas company should be run, they've made excellent strides, and I'm very proud of everything they've done there on price management, on efficiencies, but there's more continuous improvement that can take place there and they know that too. So maybe Asia and EMEA may have a little more opportunity than the Americas but no one gets a pass. No one gets a clear victory. And we think there's opportunity to everywhere and just like I said, Afrox there's a bunch of those scattered around, that we can continue to improve.
MattWhite: David, sorry, Jeff, this is Matt. I can try and help on the COGS. I mean, it's going to be a couple things as you can imagine. Clearly, with the synergies, while the fixed costs we were able to get at early in most regions, the variable costs tend to take a little more program, sometimes they take some capital. And as we've been evolving on that we've got a better stride there. Also as you know, the engineering business, it runs most things through COGS, and they had a margin expansion, they were running better through some of their absorption, as they were more efficient on how they executed projects and completed projects, that would also have an effect on that given a run through inventory and COGS, on a percent completion. So little bit of mix but also a lot of the effort around the world to just improve the efficiencies across our whole cost stack, not just fixed costs, and variable costs as well. So this is an area that we're going to continue to focus on as part of our productivity programs, which is part of our DNA.
Operator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
DuffyFischer: Yes, good morning, guys and congrats on a good quarter. First question is just around the healthcare business, obviously, last year was very volatile within healthcare, a lot of COVID stuff, but a lot of other stuff that didn't happen in hospitals. So I was wondering if you could just walk us through, what was the impact of healthcare on the volume price numbers for the Americas and for Europe, where it's sizable, and then just the follow on, when COVID finally gets put back in the bottle. Is there going to be a speed bump, where things are going to decline for a little bit before they can start growing again.
SteveAngel: Well, while back looking at that number, I'll kind of give some -- he has it. But I'll just give some commentary on that. Clearly, we had to ramp up a lot of healthcare capabilities around the world to fight COVID. Unfortunately, that's not going to be behind us for a while, I think we can see; you can look at the pace of vaccinations and the advance of these new variants. And I think it's very possible that these variants are going to outpace the world's ability to vaccinate the population, and therefore, they're going to be consuming a lot of oxygen well into 2021. And we might be talking about this, again, and this time in 2022. So I don't think this is going away anytime soon. You correctly pointed out that while we're providing more oxygen to fight COVID, that there are people that are not having elective surgeries, they didn't go into hospitals, and hospitals are focused, obviously on fighting this primary virus. And so there's not as much oxygen that's being sold for more of the elective type or more of the non more the traditional types of activities. I think, post COVID, obviously, the latter will come back. I do think that our businesses like Linde care have clearly demonstrated to the government and large managed care operators, how important it is to have a very strong capable with a wide breadth of capabilities, services, nurses, clinicians, the whole works, that can step in and be a very strong second line of defense for hospitals. And so I think in terms of pandemic preparedness going forward, I think we're in a new world now with respect to our relationship with the government. I feel very confident about that. And so I think that's going to be a positive. So that's a, I guess, a silver lining, if you will, of this COVID gave us a chance to demonstrate what we could do on a homecare basis, not just a broad hospital basis. But it might be this time next year before really talking about a world after COVID. And of course, as oxygen sub subsides may be to fight specifically COVID, then the manufacturing side of the business, the industrial side of the business, there'll be more volumes going that way. I mean I can talk about oxygen being up quite a bit. I can also look at our guns still being down quite a bit because manufacturing has not come back yet. And so there are trade offs, obviously.
DuffyFischer: Great, thanks. And then maybe just one on cash flow. So Matt, you hit on a lot of it. But even EBITDA $500 million roughly in the year, op cash of $1.3 billion. How should we think about the ratio of op cash to EBITDA going forward?
MattWhite: Duffy, yes, I can answer that. So we've said low 80s, obviously, we've been doing better than that. We finished mid-80s here this year, we still did have in 2020, roughly a quarter of a billion dollar of cash related to merger outflows. As you recall about a year ago, we said we expect that number to kind of decline down to about $200 million - $250 million. So I think we were pretty close on that. Looking into 2021, maybe it'll be $100 to $200 million, and they'll start to just phase out by the end of next year or end of this year 2021. So I still am gunning for low 80s. And we obviously internally want to do better than that. And we'd like to try and maintain these mid-80s, where we can, but in the 80 percentiles is where we want to be and obviously, there are seasonality patterns, as you know to our cash. So Q4s are higher Q1s tend to be lower. But this is something we look to grind higher and improve on year on year out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
VincentAndrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Maybe just to start off with you mentioned, Sanjiv mentioned the renewable diesel opportunity. I think that's what you're speaking when you speak about biofuels. How do you think about that? I presume that's more of a merchant opportunity than an onsite opportunity. But I'm just thinking about that business being very reliant on government subsidies. So how do you think about servicing that industry and customer base?
SanjivLamba: Thanks, Vince. So let me kind of just elaborate on the point I made earlier on, which is that we see developing opportunity around the biofuels. We see both some regulatory pressure there, which is kind of driving the demand. And therefore we see interest on kind of growing that piece. Now we don't see that as a merchant opportunity. We see that as an on site opportunity. The hydrogen requirements are reasonably substantial. We're looking at a number of projects at the moment where we are working with folks who are looking at developing that further. So we see that interest in the market, we see the demand coming through, we see the interest, driven from a couple of different governments who are kind of providing some sponsorship for that governmental agencies that are providing sponsor for that in the US in particular. And we see that as an area where more hydrogen is needed, because the process itself requires greater hydroprocessing and hydrotreating.
VincentAndrews: Okay, and as a follow up, could we just get an update on the trends in hard goods versus packaged gas sales in the US?
SteveAngel: Yes, so I'll take that. If we look at the fourth quarter, it's flat to probably slightly up year-over-year on package gases in the US. And so we got to get back to normal gas a little stronger than hardgoods. In Q4, as I look at January, coming out of the blocks, the trend is stronger. So gas is looks in pretty good shape and hardgoods is still slightly negative at this point, but gas it looks stronger than what I saw in Q4. So what drives that? Agriculture is doing well. Automotives have been strong. Apparently, a lot of people are buying recreational vehicles, maybe some of you on the phone are buying them too, especially gases continues to be strong.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.
SteveByrne: Yes, thank you. I got to believe that you're among the largest electricity consumers in the region that you operate in. And I suspect that gives you significant negotiating power for rates. In one of your slides, you mentioned more than a third of the energy is low carbon. Can you comment on the pricing that you're getting on that versus carbon based energy sources? And maybe more broadly, do you see this as giving you an advantage in green hydrogen, like for example, this just 24 megawatt electrolyzer that you're going to build in Luna, Germany, I can only imagine that the contract that you're going to get on the power or the electricity on this to drive that electrolyzer has to be significantly different than any of ITM were bidding on that job on their own.
SteveAngel: Yes. I think that's a good point. And that projects specifically, there's two ways to buy power, you can buy it off the grid, you can use your green certificates as part of -- is all part of their renewable energy directive, something like that. I don't remember the name exactly. And then also we can negotiate directly with the utilities, which we have been doing, I feel very competent with where we're going to come out. The way we think about renewable energy, obviously, we are a large user, which gives us some advantages. And being able to combine that to make green hydrogen, or make green hydrogen by using renewable power source in terms of just what you can get off the grid through electrolysis, I think is important to being able to produce and sell 100% carbon free hydrogen. The pricing that we see, I mean, we have a fairly sophisticated group of people, because again, we buy a lot -- we buy, I think it's $3 billion last year of power around the world. So we buy a lot of power, we're pretty sophisticated in terms of how we negotiate contracts. What I've seen, it's been on par with what we would normally get. And so we're not looking to sacrifice economics to claim we have a higher percent renewable, we want to accomplish both. And I think we're up to 37% renewable now. I think we were at 34 so or 33 maybe a couple years ago, so we're making some progress, the goal was to double the original number. And if I remember right, that's like going from a $1 billion renewable power purchases to about $2 billion. So it is something that we're focused on here. And it's, obviously, if the ultimate goal is to be carbon neutral by some date, then obviously, through by either proactively contract renewable power, or just countries naturally green their grids, it's going to be an important part of how we ultimately get there.
SteveByrne: And, Steve, you're a couple years into this merger, you mentioned productivity as a margin driver in all three segments. Where would you say you are? In what inning are you in, in this vision that you had about where this merger could get in terms of the structure? And to improve the productivity of the merged entity? Where would you say you are at in that process?
SanjivLamba: Hey, Steve, I am going to jump in here. This is Sanjiv. Just to give you a quick flavor of that. And I'm going to try and cover that for two different aspects. So I think, Steve, and I spend a lot of time talking about this, if this is something that we see, deeply embedded in our businesses, I've described this previously on previous conversations we've had in the earnings call saying, I see the fact that we've got productivity entrenched in the business at a level where we've got to generate in different countries, hundreds of projects to make sure that they are actually delivering on a continuous basis. And I think you've heard Steve say this before, in everyday we look at our businesses, we kind of figure out how we can be better than we were yesterday. So it is a continuous program. It's something that's deeply entrenched in the business, it's something that is embedded in the DNA of people who work in our business, and we look at it every day, it isn't a program that we run, it's something that we live and breathe. So that's kind of the cultural aspect of productivity, if you like, and -- I mean I can ask Steve later on but I feel that he agrees with my view that we've made substantial progress on this journey. This was new to half the organization, if you will, but the way they've embraced it and kind of move forward with it has been very, very encouraging. I want to give you a different slant on productivity as well. One of the things that we drive at is sustainable productivity, productivity that helps in our sustainability targets and ensuring that we're contributing to those goals that we set up. And we do that through making sure we've got sustainability initiatives, again, within the business, on efficiency, on energy management, on managing emissions, et cetera, which all of which actually contribute, not just to the bottom line, which is very important for me, but also in fact to the sustainability goals that we've set up as well. And again, I say there's a lot more work to be done. But we are really off to a great start in that space. So, as I see it, I think we are well on our way on this journey. Obviously, we can see a lot of benefits ahead of us if we continue to keep the pace and momentum on this.
SteveAngel: Just one more point to add to that, Sanjiv, you've covered a beautifully. If you go back and look at again, Praxair's history, we go back and look at that 25 year history. We grew earnings per share double digits over that 25 year times span, and that's through recessions as through weak growth periods as through energy crisis, commodity bust, I mean, you name all of that and we were able to do it. Not because volume was just tremendously strong for 25 years, it was a factor. But clearly, good price management and strong productivity. And that's, so we have a track record of knowing how to do this. And the fact that we have now have a much larger organization that hasn't been added quite so long, I think is very encouraging. I am very pleased and very proud of what really the whole organization has done in terms of grabbing on to productivity, but it's not a three year, five year, 10 year or 25 year thing. It's something that you do for the rest of your life.
Operator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
P.J.Juvekar: Yes, thank you. Steve, on these calls, you said before that green hydrogen costs are high, and they need to come down by 50% to be competitive. Your 24 megawatt sort of green hydrogen project in Lavena. What is the sensitivity of that project to price of green hydrogen, which is likely to fall in the coming years? And how do you plan for that for a project like that?
SteveAngel: Well, obviously this project that it met our return criteria, I mean, the costs are higher. Why? Because renewable power costs are still relatively high around the world, they need to come down as we scale up some kind of looking at as you get into bigger projects. So that's a factor. This is a relatively large PEM, as I said, is the largest one announced 24 megawatts. So this is not where it's going to be 10 years from now, in terms of cost, it's a kind of the early days in terms of producing projects of this size. So the CapEx costs are higher, the OpEx costs are higher. So we know costs need to come down both through the whole electrolysis process, but also in the renewable power. Renewable power is a significant factor of that. So those costs are going to come down. We clearly receive subsidies in this project. In fact, most of these projects, we do receive subsidies, so that clearly helps with these projects. And that's probably important till the costs do come down so that green hydrogen can be competitive. I'd say on its own with gray hydrogen, though there's always going to be some gap. But I think closing that gap is very important. And obviously a carbon price as it's assigned to carbon molecules in the future will help do that. But this project works, obviously, we have negotiations that have been completed before we ever made the announcement. So we know that that the prices work. But there certainly are sensitivities around the market price on the non contracted piece like there would be with any merchant liquid business, and there are sensitivities around the input side on renewable power. And we took very conservative assumptions going into this thinking that we probably were going to end up with a better deal that would help us when we finally conclude the power negotiations. So that's how I'd answer that. But you're right, I've said 50%, it's probably 60% is probably closer to the truth.
P.J.Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. And just a quick, long term question on refining. The writing is on the wall. If you see announcements in California, what GM said recently, that diesel and gasoline demand is going to go down by 2030-2035? So what is the future of the hydrogen business? And can those plants be repurposed into making green hydrogen or something else?
SteveAngel: Yes, I mean, I think the answer to your question is yes, they can be repurposed. And unlike perhaps other industries, you got to keep in mind, they use a lot of hydrogen today, you know that, but it's gray hydrogen. So dropping in blue hydrogen, which I think would probably be a very good solution for them. And even green, if you look at Texas, there's lots of renewable power. There's obviously lots of natural gas, you have depleted all reservoir. So I think blue or green can be substituted for gray. I think it'd be very helpful to refineries if the costs come down to enable that. So there is some ability to do that. And I think that's going to happen. I think longer term, it's kind of like probably, other industries in the past that have been having, and they've seen their better growth days perhaps. I'm not the official spokesman on what happens in the refining industry, but what I think is you take a place like the US Gulf Coast, which you have very strong, large scale, and very efficient refineries. They can use, you know the story. They can heavier suite Indiscernible] 1:10:01.8 feedstocks, they're very complex refineries; they can produce the full suite of transportation fuels. They're heavily integrated with the petrochemical industry at large in US Gulf Coast. So I happen to think that, if people think they're going to turn into a dinosaur, they'll probably be the last dinosaurs walking around or going to be down in the US Gulf Coast.
Operator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.
JohnMcNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Steve, you'd mentioned in, I guess your opening remarks that you had a couple projects that it sounded like you were close to closing on the carbon capture side, I guess, can you help us to understand if with all the green talk, we've actually reached a tipping point when it comes to carbon capture? And if so, I guess how you are thinking about sizing the opportunity, as you look out say over the next three to five years?
SteveAngel:  I mean, there are several projects we have in our sites that were close to closing where we need the co2 for commercial purposes. So the customer has an incentive with the cost of co2 emissions going up, they have an incentive to have us capture that carbon. And we have a use board in terms of commercial, whether it's for greenhouses, whether it's for to make dry ice, Ph control, carbon, carbonation of beverages, all of those are our uses of co2. So we have specific projects, which I think certainly help with economics, where you have an end market use for the co2. We have several projects like that. We have others that we have worked on; working on with, say, coal fire utilities that are looking at carbon capture. We obviously have solutions around. We have multiple solutions around carbon capture, but it can be post combustion, it can be pre combustion. And I think for some of those to move forward, particularly in a place like the United States, you need a more defined cost of carbon of co2. But I think when that happens, and you have to think that this administration is very determined to make that happen. You will see some of these projects move forward. I don't think it's going to be as large as I look at it today. I could be wrong, as perhaps the straight hydrogen opportunities, but they can be significant too.
JohnMcNulty: Got it. Thanks for the color on that. And then I guess just one question on pricing. So when we look at the trends regionally, it seems like at least the ones that you're reporting, Asia doesn't seem to have quite as robust of a maybe a pricing dynamic. And I guess the question is -- is that a function of the business mix that you have where you have some of these huge electronics applications where maybe there's not a lot of merchant or packaged product? Or is it - was it really just more competitive dynamic in those regions? I guess how should we be thinking about that?
SanjivLamba: So let me jump into this. This is Sanjiv here. Let me kind of give you a little bit of color on that. So the market in Asia Pacific, as you might imagine is quite varied. And the largest market in there for us is obviously China. So the dynamic around pricing that we see is twofold. One, obviously, we have many large on site projects, obviously, from a portfolio perspective, the opportunity around the merchant site pricing impact that we can fully bring to bear is a little bit more limited than potentially some of the other segments. But more importantly, I think in a market like China, where we've got some significant end user customers, which is where we focus our efforts and energy on. But at times, we would use the distributor model as well to make sure that we've got our plants running at optimal levels. And in 2020, in particular, that became quite important. So we wanted to make sure that channel was fully utilized. And when you do that, then the pricing impact actually does get moderated down a little bit. You've seen that happen in 2020. It is an area of focus. And just as I talked about productivity, the other piece I'd say pricing is an area of focus every day. And the guys in China in particular, know that we are watching that very carefully. We review that in every month of the GBR and they do have a bit of a tough time around that. So there is a lot of action happening in the marketplace around that which hopefully will reflect in the quarters ahead.
Operator: And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
LaurenceAlexander: Good morning. Two questions. One is what you see is a reasonable timeline for blending of hydrogen into natural gas pipelines for heating applications becoming material for Linde in Europe or the US. And secondly, with respect to acquisitions, and how you think about the boundaries for the business model, if we think about like kinds of forays that you've done into adjacent cities, specialty gases for healthcare, electronic chemicals, co jets, there's been, where do you see kind of logical extensions of the business model? I mean, for example, like remote monitoring of industrial boilers, or would you ever engage in vertical integration to total production of ammonia or methanol, just how do you see the boundary conditions for what you would look at in terms of either acquisitions or flexing the business model a bit?
SteveAngel: Yes. Well, I think as I think about that question, Laurence, there are so many uses for our basic core products, co2, oxygen, and our rare gases, all of our products that they become new uses. And we talk about co2 for greenhouse gases. And of course, you have this little thing called cannabis, which is a growing marketplace. Dry ice for biopharma dry ice to carry it back, dry ice has been around a long time. So there we continue to find good uses and applications, new uses of applications in markets that are growing. If you look at commercial space, we're selling hydrogen, we're selling oxygen, we are selling nitrogen for as rocket propellant, and they call it and with what is used depend on the rocket and the platform and the company. We also sell rare gases that are used in I'll call it satellite mobility. So a lot of new markets that are developing that consume are our basic gases. And as far as I don't like, to stray too far away from our, I'll call it our coordinating our business model is pretty good. And we think we are pretty good at executing this business model. So history has shown us that you never want to lose sight of your strengths. And we won't do that. But certainly any opportunity that's developing that we think lends itself to an industrial gas approach model approach will certainly pursue, we all like growth here. Certainly, that's not a problem. So in terms of acquisitions, I think that we'll be-- you'll be seeing a lot more, we'll be doing a lot in the package gas space, I think we'll do it in the healthcare space. I think those are natural Decaps kind of come and go, you can look at the same Decaps for five years and nothing moves forward. So that's more opportunistic in my mind. As far as blending hydrogen into natural gas, I mean, that is the clear intention of this partnership that we formed with Snam in Italy, which is the largest natural gas operator in Europe. And they're very committed to blending hydrogen in with their natural gas. I have to go back and look I think it's probably at the 10% level. But even that, if you did that across the entire world that's a very significant amount, there are some limitations because you got to start changing out burner equipment on the other end. Compression, you might have to change out compression, depending on how high but make sure you get the hydrogen and certain kind of metallurgy, you have to take a closer look at as hydrogen grows, but it is something that I think is getting closer to fruition.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. And I'd like to turn the call back over to Juan Pelaez for any closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Chrystal, thank you and thanks everyone for participating. Have a great rest of your day. And if you need anything else, feel free to reach out. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q3 2020 Linde earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Juan Pelaez. Sir, you may begin.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks Chris. Good morning everyone and thank you for attending our 2020 third quarter earnings call and webcast. I am Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer, Matt White, Chief Financial Officer and Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Operating Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slide and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Steve and Matt will now give an update on Linde's quarter performance and we will then be available to answer questions. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Angel: Thanks Juan and good morning everyone. Another outstanding performance by the Linde team worldwide. And I am thinking especially about all our employees who have been delivering products, servicing customers, filling cylinders, operating plants, building plants and taking care of patients and they have been doing that uninterrupted from the beginning of this pandemic. You can see we delivered very strong financial performance this quarter. We achieved record operating margins in all our gas segments, driven by good cost and price management and better volumes which we were able to leverage down the income statement. Based on our fourth quarter guidance, we expect to deliver 12% earnings per share growth for the full year on top of 23% growth last year, ex-FX. As expected, the more resilient markets we serve, healthcare, electronics and food freezing continued to perform well. And our fixed fee contracts have protected us from volume reductions in the more cyclical end markets. Geographically, all segments showed volume improvement versus Q2 but still remain below pre-COVID levels. Going in the Q4, I expect volumes in Asia, led by China, Taiwan and South Korea, to be positive, both sequentially and year-over-year. However, we see grow flattening out in both the Americas and Europe sequentially, as COVID cases continue to rise or remain at elevated levels. The impact is most pronounced in our metals and manufacturing market segments. This is consistent with published macroeconomic data and with what you are hearing from other companies. I know there is a lot of interest regarding 2021. I think we will all acknowledge COVID is a bit of a wild card at this point. What I am confident in is the resiliency of our integrated supply business model, which we have been clearly demonstrating. Our ability to achieve positive pricing in any environment, the strength of our backlog and our ability to achieve cost efficiencies on an ongoing basis. Assuming stable volumes, I am confident that we will deliver another year of double digit earnings growth in 2021. This is all can share with you on 2021 today, but we will provide a more detailed outlook on our next earnings call. You can see in the appendix a chart that tracks our performance against the 35% greenhouse gas intensity reduction goal we announced in February. With a 19% reduction to-date versus our 2018 baseline year, we are clearly well on our way towards achieving our goal. With us on the call today is Sanjiv Lamba who we recently announced is our new Chief Operating Officer. A little bit about Sanjiv. He has spend his entire career in industrial gases, beginning with BOC, then Linde AG and upon our merger, Lindy PLC. It is fair to say, he has survived and thrived in three different administrations and two major integrations. He is deeply knowledgeable of all three modes of industrial gas supply on site, merchant and packaged gases and has been a strong advocate for our strategy of building network density in core geographies. Under his leadership, APAC has improved operating margins over 500 basis points over the last two years, driven by cost efficiencies, good price management and the rollout of digitalization initiatives. The integration between legacy Praxair and Linde AG in Asia was completed ahead of scheduled and generated substantial benefits for the company. Another indication of the success of the merger and Sanjiv's leadership is our employee survey results, which were quite positive across the entire Asia population. On the project side, 70% of our sale of gas backlog today is in Asia and many of those projects were won as a result of Sanjiv's leadership. In terms of clean energy, Sanjiv has been a strong advocate. We have more project activity in Asia today than any other part of the world. And I expect Asia to be the region where we first see meaningful results. Sanjiv has been a staunch supporter of all our corporate values, safety, integrity, diversity, community and sustainability. And I expect him to continue to work diligently to improve our performance in all of these areas. As you saw on the announcement, Sanjiv will be responsible for the Americas, APAC and EMEA regional operating segments, as well as Linde Engineering, Lincare and global functions. And he will relocate to Danbury, Connecticut. With that I will turn it over to Sanjiv to say a few words.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. I wanted to be given this opportunity and I really appreciate the vote of confidence from Steve and the entire Board of Directors. As Steve said, with my 30-plus years in the industrial gases space, I can say with some pride that Linde today is an exceptional company with a strong operating culture and a laser sharp focus on sustainably creating value for our shareholders. I also believe Line is uniquely positioned to leverage its technology to generate quality growth while making our customers more efficient, sustainable and indeed our planet and our world more productive. I look forward to working closely with Steve, the leadership team and indeed our talented employees around the world to continue to drive growth and high quality results for our shareholders. As I transition into the new role, I hope to get a chance to meet most of you, at least virtually, in the coming month. I will not turn it over to Matt to discuss the Q3 performance and outlook.
Matt White: Thanks Sanjiv and good morning everyone. The third quarter results can be found on slide three. Sales of $6.9 billion were 2% below prior year, but 7% higher sequentially. Versus prior year, volumes were down 3% as lower base volumes, primarily in the manufacturing end-market, more than offset positive contribution from project startups in APAC and Americas. While it's difficult to know the exact impact from COVID, we estimate the Q3 effect to be a mid single digit percent decrease. Despite the lower year-over-year volumes, we had a solid sequential improvement with the gas volumes increasing 6% from recovery in food and beverage, refining and chemicals and the more cyclical markets of metals and manufacturing. At the consolidated level, engineering sales were flat with prior year, but down 3% from the second quarter. This was primarily due to project timing as the sale of equipment backlog has held relatively steady at $4.9 billion. Pricing trends continued to be positive with increases of 2% over prior year and 1% over the second quarter. All geographic segments achieved higher pricing as local management took actions to recover cost inflation. You will notice that the year-over-year impact from FX was 0%, due primarily to a stronger Euro and Chinese RMB, mostly offset by weaker Latin American currencies. Sequentially, FX was a 3% tailwind as the dollar depreciated across most foreign currencies. Operating profit of $1.5 billion or 22.1% of sales rose 9% from 2019 and 15% sequentially. Versus prior year, operating profit grew from a combination of higher pricing, cost management and defensive revenues in the form of resilient end-markets and fixed contract payments. In fact, operating margins expanded 230 basis points from 2019, our fifth quarter in a row of expanding margins more than 200 basis points. Sequentially, operating profit grew 15% and margins increased 140 basis points from strong profit leverage on the higher volumes. As demonstrated this quarter, our business has a unique combination of downside protection with fixed payments and resilient end-markets yet upside potential on economic recovery. Diluted EPS of $2.15 was 11% higher than prior year and 13% higher sequentially. Frankly, I don't expect you will find many industrial or material companies that can claim year-over-year double digit percent EPS growth in this environment, which speaks to the high performance culture and quality of the Linde business model. Further validation of our performance can be found in the cash flow trends. Q3 operating cash flow of $1.9 billion increased from both prior year and second quarter, confirming a continued high conversion of earnings to cash flow and resulting in an operating cash flow to EBITDA ratio of 84%. Equally important is the disciplined capital deployment, evidenced by prudent CapEx investments and a consistently rising return on capital, which reached a record 12.8% this quarter. Base CapEx, which represents all non-backlog spending, has increased from smaller on-site growth projects, primarily serving the manufacturing end-market including paper and glass. However, project CapEx, which represents contractual growth with spend over $5 million, has declined primarily due to startups. While our ability to start up on time speaks to the quality of our customers and contracts, I do anticipate the overall backlog to decline into 2021, similar to the trends we saw in 2009 and 2015 following capital cycle corrections. But recall following those corrections, customer projects spending rebounded and subsequently led to significant project backlog growth including a record year in 2011. So using history as a guide, I expect the capital cycle will eventually recover and provide future growth opportunities. Return on capital is the ultimate metric for this industry and we have consistently demonstrated a prudent balance of growth and quality. Poor contract management and misallocation of CapEx can lead to significant cash losses, potentially even greater than the initial investment. This explains why Linde is laser focused on a consistent proven investment process to stay within our core expertise, a dense integrated supply network while properly balancing diversification, risk and return. Now while we had a solid third quarter performance, I believe it's just as important to discuss our longer range trends, which you can find on slide four. From a financial perspective, our owners want a company that will deliver high quality growth while prudently managing capital and generating excess cash to fund growth and shareholder distributions. And when looking at our results since the merger in Q4 of 2018, that's exactly what you find. The top half of this slide demonstrates high quality growth. In just under two years, we expanded EBIT margins 600 basis points and grew quarterly EPS by 42%. Most companies would be pleased with this performance by itself. Yet, we accomplished it with a commitment to capital discipline. 2020 year-to-date operating cash flow is up 27% and free cash flow has more than doubled. This enables funding of growth and shareholder distributions, including a 10% dividend increase and over $2 billion of share repurchases. Furthermore, return on capital has increased 250 basis points from the merger date. It's also important to note that financial performance wasn't our only focus. We are living our core values through improved safety performance, employee diversity and carbon reduction which are all detailed in our 2020 sustainability report that was issued in July. Many people tend to forget that we achieved these results while integrating two complex multinational companies during a global pandemic. In fact, while some stated we would not be successful, I continue to look forward to what we will accomplish next. I will now wrap things up with our updated 2020 guidance which you can find on slide five. For the fourth quarter, we are estimating EPS in the range of $2.11 to $2.16. Excluding the 1% FX headwind assumption, this range represents 13% to 15% growth over 2019. We are anticipating flat volumes sequentially as incremental project contribution is expected to be mostly offset by seasonally lower sales and engineering project timing. We believe this range is appropriate in light of the continued uncertainty around the pandemic and subsequent economic impact. Full year guidance is now $8.05 to $8.10, which includes an estimated 2% FX headwind. This updated range falls within our February 2020 pre-COVID estimate of $8 to $8.25. So in summary, irrespective of the global challenges, we are expecting to grow full year EPS 12% ex-currency and thus deliver on our original 2020 financial commitment. I would now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning fellows. First question, if we could just go to the slide that Matt was just on, slide four, the chart in the upper left-hand corner just showing the profit margin expansion. Could you talk about the size of the buckets that contributed to that? How much was price? How much was integration? How much was just cost-cutting at respective companies? And then is there anything in that improvement that would be transitory that might become a headwind in there when you think of something like maybe in Lincare you might be over earning because COVID is a respiratory disease? Maybe that's got better business this year than it might a year or so from now? So anything in there that we would need to overcome to keep that as either a base or base to grow from?
Steve Angel: Well, the way I would answer that, Duffy, is in any given year, you are going to have some headwinds, you are going to have maybe some tailwinds and then the rest of the year you just got to go execute. And I think the point is, year-in, year-out, quarter-in, quarter-out, every month, the team executes at a high level. Pricing is always an element of this. And if you go back of this time frame, I am sure probably it was about 2%. We always get pricing in this business. We will get it going forward as well. So I think that is a factor. Certainly good cost management through this last quarter, several quarters, which is very important as a result of COVID. And then as you spoke about earlier, we did have some merger synergies which, quite frankly, I don't look at anymore because that's kind of in the rearview mirror to us, because right now, we are just working on cost efficiencies in every business. And so that will sustain us going forward. And what I am confident in our ability to continue to drive operating margins more towards is kind of what I said continued price improvement, continued good cost management, productivity programs which we have been ramping up here and whatever volume comes our way. I think you seen from Q2 to Q3, we were able to take that volume and translate it into ever higher levels of margin all the way down the income statement. And of course, we have some large project contribution to look forward to. And that will be -- we have a fairly healthy backlog today. So that will sustain us for a while. So we will continue that trend that you are referring to the upper left-hand side.
Duffy Fischer: Perfect. And then, if you could maybe just look at merchant and package and kind of walk through the three big geographies and what you are seeing volume-wise there and how that looks today?
Steve Angel: Well, I think package is more impacted by manufacturing. So manufacturing globally has been suffering more so than other market segments. So if I look inside of that number and if you looked at the United States, for example, you would see that hardgoods is weaker than gas. So you probably still have negative double digit year-over-year hardgoods volumes. But on the gas side, it would be much better, say low negative single digit. So you kind of have those trends. On the merchant side, it can be affected by resilient markets, it often is. So if you were to look at the U.S. and Europe, healthcare, food freezing are large markets for us and those markets have held up very well, as Matt spoke about and as you can see in that end-market chart in the back. And then if you were to look at Asia, you would see that electronics markets and we do provide merchant liquid in electronics markets too, it's not all over the fence, holds up quite well. So merchant, generally speaking, would be better because of the resilient end-market exposure. Package gas a little weaker because of manufacturing. In both cases, the fixed fee structures have held up exceptionally well.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Bob Koort: Thank you very much. Steve or Matt, I wanted to ask you guys about hydrogen a little bit here. Obviously there's been a lot of fanfare about this market. But wondering how it fits in, Matt, with your description of investing with high returns on capital and exploiting your core dense network? Is it something you [ph] can lend itself with or are you going to do more rifle shot, asking as to how you think about that market opportunity?
Matt White: I would say rifle shots, very focused shots based on end-market presence, end-market infrastructure, customers we know, customers often, in most cases, we are already supplying. And so to me, these look very much like the normal fare industrial gas over the fence projects. The only difference is clean hydrogen is the product. That's the only difference.
Steve Angel: Yes. And just to add to that, Bob, as you can imagine it, it's an asset intensive growth area. And that's, we view as our strength is to manage these assets and get good returns relative to the risk on that. So we don't see that very different at all on how the rest of the industrial gas business runs and is operated.
Bob Koort: That's helpful. Thanks. And Steve, I know last time you guys named the COO, he only was there for about a year and then there was a succession. Should we read into this that you are planning on heading out at some point in the not so distant future? Or can we rely on you sticking at the home for a while longer?
Steve Angel: One day I will head out, but there is nothing decided or planned. But you can rest assured, one day I will not be here.
Bob Koort: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Up next, we have Peter Clark of Societe Generale. Your line is open.
Peter Clark: Hi guys. Thank you. Good morning everyone. And welcome, Sanjiv. I have got a quick query on terms of the guidance. Obviously you are at the top end, the way you were guiding back in February. And since then we had the pandemic develop across the world. Obviously, you took a bigger volume hit, clearly productivity has been a key thing. But for you, Steve, would you say the way that Linde PLC has adjusted to this, would it be the same as Praxair, i.e. the organization has pretty much adjusted to the way you would like to see it? And then the follow-up to that is obviously for Sanjiv because I think way back in Q2 2019, we were told Asia was off the mark very quickly in terms of adjusting and productivity benefits. I am just wondering how you see the difference at Linde PLC, the main differences anyway as against Linde AG and perhaps even BOC? Thank you.
Steve Angel: So I will take the first part question and then I will turn that over to Sanjiv. Quite frankly, across the board, at Linde PLC people did what they needed to do to address the challenges of COVID whether that was jumping through hoops to take care of patients. There was a recent article about what our drivers and our team did in India to provide oxygen to all those hospitals in need. So that's what people did really across the board. There is hundreds of stories just like that. But from a cost management standpoint, I would say everybody stepped up to the challenge and there really is no differentiation in terms of legacy organizations.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thanks Peter. My observation on the productivity piece would really go something like this. In Linde PLC, the main difference I see is, we find productivity as a fundamental part of our business process. It's entirely embedded. It's not a program as we might have run in Linde AG or an initiative that's separate from the business. It doesn't sit on top. It fits within the business. It's something we do everyday. There are thousands of projects that we have that build and deliver on these productivity efforts and the overall benefits that we see in there. And I think that's kind of the fundamental difference between what I have seen in the past and what we are now going through in Linde PLC.
Peter Clark: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Next, we have Nicola Tang of Exane BNP. Your line is open.
Nicola Tang: Hi everyone. Thanks for the presentation and thanks for taking my questions. And congrats, Sanjiv, on the promotion. Firstly, I want to talk about the backlog. Matt, in your remarks, you were commenting a decline in the backlog into 2021. I was wondering if you could talk about the existing backlog as well? And do you see any delays in your existing backlog at the moment? And when I look at your revised CapEx guidance, I see you have taken it down very slightly. Is that related to at all to project delays or cancellations? Or is that low-end non-project spend? And then I had a second question on the buyback. Should I pause there?
Steve Angel: Well, you can keep going and I will take the first one and I will let Matt handle the second one. Most likely, I haven't heard your question yet, but most likely.
Nicola Tang: Okay. The second question was, the original commitment around the buyback, I think, was $6 billion by February 2021. I know that you paused in Q2, but you restarted it in Q3. It seems to be a bit of a lower pace than in previous months. And if my calculation is correct, I think you have about $1.7 billion of the buyback remaining. So I was wondering if you are still committed to completing this within the original timeframe of February 2021? Or whether you are trying to be a bit more practical about the pace, perhaps related to the equity market or perhaps related to market conditions for decaps or projects?
Steve Angel: Okay. So this is Steve. I will take the first part, on the backlog. So the backlog number we publish is a function of projects that we have signed that come into the backlog and projects that have started up which comes out of the backlog. And so you have got to kind of divorce that from an annualized CapEx spend rate. But what Matt was saying is, we can look at projects we are starting up next year and that's a good thing, right. That's why we closed those projects so we get it started up so we could start seeing the revenue and the returns. But based on the amount that we are going to be starting up and based on our best estimate in terms of when we will replenish or we will add projects to the backlog, it is likely that number could come down. Now it could also bounce around some because again, this is lumpy. So that's really what he is referring to. And if we think just really in terms of where we think projects are going to come from or where they are coming from, electronics is quite strong and for reasons that you are all very much aware of. So if anything, electronics opportunity pipeline is becoming stronger over time. Clearly, clean energy, we are looking at quite a few projects. It's a question of timing. And then I would say, the rest of the project opportunity slate is really more of a function of demand. There are projects that we know customers would like to do but right now their balance sheets, their businesses are fairly weak. And they are going to wait until demand comes back. But this kind of goes back to Matt's earlier point that when demand comes back, all kinds of projects tend to flow back into the pipeline system. With respect to delays, I don't expect to see much in the way of further delays other than what we have seen, which was very mild compared what you have heard others talk about. We are pretty confident about the status of, certainly, all the big projects that we have in the pipeline today. I don't anticipate any further delays. And we feel very good about when we will start seeing the commercial benefits from those investments. And with respect to a little lower CapEx spend, I mean I would say, certainly all of the project opportunities we are pursuing. This would non-growth spend that we had just been continuing to manage closely, more closely every day, set refining savings here and there, which is what we always expected would happen as we really focus more so on the non-growth CapEx spend. But inside of that number, that base CapEx number, the growth with respect to pulp and paper projects, with respect to glass, with respect to lithium-ion battery projects, small on-site projects, really is quite strong. And so that has been a very favorable trend throughout COVID.
Matt White: Thanks Stephen. Hi Nicola. Yes, I will just add one point to Steve before I go to the buyback question. I think. Just to clarify too, our definition of backlog, the definitions are not consistent in this industry. So I just want to make sure you understand that, in my opinion, we have the most stringent definition on how we define backlog. It must be growth. It must be contractually secured over $5 million. It means we don't put MoUs. We don't put LoIs. We don't put merchant-only type projects. So to Steve's point, even within our base CapEx spending, a little less than half of that is for growth and for very good growth. For on sites below $5 million, some of these small on-sites were put in places like glass and some other strong growing markets like paper. We also are seeing a lot of good growth opportunities in there that may not meet our backlog definition but we see good returns relative to the risk and things we are pursuing. So I just wanted to make sure when you think about the capital we are spending on growth, there are two elements. There is what fits our fairly stringent backlog definition, but then there is a substantial portion of growth that we also have that we are pursuing in the base CapEx. Regarding the share buybacks, yes, just a couple points to make. First, the expiration, I wouldn't look too deep into that, into February. That's more of a technicality that's required under the European MAR requirements. In reality, I think a better way to think about how we look at buybacks is that they are an integral part of our capital allocation policy. As you probably well know, we always look to maintain our A rating and grow the dividend every year. And then after that, our priority is to grow and it's to invest in growth. It could be acquisitions, could be decaps, could be projects. But we always tend to have a lot of excess capital left over and then with that excess capital, that goes to buybacks. So our expectation is to continue to have open buyback programs. As far as why we were probably a little bit less on track than the $6 billion, obviously as you know, with COVID, we turned it off for about a quarter, just in light of the items we discussed at that time in Q2. But this is something that we have been in the market now every day since August, since we started back up. And our approach is to be in the market every day and then when we see opportunities we will go heavier at times. But this is something that will be an integral part of our capital allocation policy.
Nicola Tang: All right. Thank you.
Steve Angel: Chris, do we have anymore questions?
Operator: Yes, sir. Next question is from David Begleiter.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Steve, there were some concern that weakness in refining might impact your Americas result and margins. That didn't appear to be the case. So can you talk about what happened with your refining business in Q3 and what drove the strong margin expansion in Americans in Q3 as well? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Okay. Yes. So the first part of your question is, there is a concern that refining may have hurt our margins. Is that what you said? Because I was kind of --
David Begleiter: Yes. In the Americas, yes.
Steve Angel: Okay. So Americas, it's a big region. So there is a lot of elements to it. But let me just say, I think obviously 28% operating margin is not bad. So how did we get there? And good pricing, good cost management, team reacted very quickly. We finished out some of the integration opportunities we had earlier. So we certainly saw some of the benefits of that. The Americas has always been very strong on productivity programs. And the fixed fee structure, take-or-pays, all that held up very well throughout this period. So that's really what -- and the resilient end-markets, obviously we benefit from that in healthcare, food freezing, predominately in the Americas, as I talked about earlier. And we are doing very well in those markets. With respect to refining, as I look, the volumes certainly are down, Q3 year-over-year. They were up sequentially from Q2. There is some noise in that because of a series of hurricanes that certainly affected Lake Charles. The first hurricane affected Motiva. So there needed to be, they had to recover from that and they have been recovering from that. So October obviously looks a little better, save in September for that reason. But we were, even though it is down year-over-year, again we have very good commercial terms and conditions of all those contracts down there that protect us. And so again as I said earlier, there is always tailwinds and headwinds and things we just have to go execute. So I have never seen a quarter yet where there is nothing but tailwinds. So that was just one headwind during the quarter we had to deal with. The team did a very good job. But we are pretty much out of that now. I don't anticipate another hurricane between now and the rest of year. So I think they will be fine. The biggest issue in refining, as you know, is that the diesel fuel side has been strong, the gas side has been very weak though has been coming back and jet fuel where refineries typically make good margins has been terrible. But refinery utilization is coming up from where it was. The low-80s is not good place for them. They need to be much higher than that to start making money. But we are in pretty good shape.
David Begleiter: And Steve, lastly, just on the European shutdowns. Have you seen any impact yet? And anyway to quantify the impacts in Q4 for you guys?
Steve Angel: Well, I think the answer to that is, we have to watch it, I think, pretty closely because a lot of these shutdowns have really started going into effect. Clearly, I can look at volumes and see that medical oxygen is quite strong. But it's been strong. And so it continued to be strong in October. And that typically is a function of COVID case rates. The COVID case rates go up, I expect to see our oxygen sales go up. So that's been strong. I believe there probably was some build ahead, knowing that these shutdowns were coming. So we probably got a little better volumes than we would ordinarily get as people were preparing in advance for the shutdowns. But this is why we are saying flat sales in Q4 because I think we are going to see the effects of this for the rest of the quarter. We are confident that it will be around flat, but certainly the shutdowns in Europe are going to be a drag to volumes and we anticipated they would be, though the medical side, I am sure, will continue to be strong throughout.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
John McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe a question around how to think about the backlog and potential for activity? I think, look, every recession is a little bit different. And this one obviously was deeper than the 2009 recession. But it seems to have snapped back maybe a little bit more quickly. I guess, how are you thinking about the progression of how your backlog or when your backlog may actually start to improve, just given the differences in recessions? Is there a way to think about that at this point?
Steve Angel: It's hard for me to forecast that. I think electronics projects are going to be there. So I am pretty confident about that. I think the only question about clean energy is the timing of some of these projects. If I look at all the projects we track, the number is well into the billions of dollars. But how many of these go forward? At what pace? I think really remains to be seen. I do think, over the next three years, we will probably spend $1 billion of CapEx against clean energy. But again, that's based on my assumptions of when some of these projects are likely to break loose. Obviously, what we are working on far exceeds that. But I think that's kind of a reasonable expectation that we have here internally. With respect to the rest of the backlog, it's really a function of demand, John. So I think if demand comes back, you will see some of these oil and gas companies, for example, start to spend money on decarbonization projects really with or without regulations because I know they want to but really they are not in a financial condition to do that today. So it really hinges more on demand, I would say.
John McNulty: Got it. Fair enough. And I guess, maybe top that. So 2Q obviously was a pretty big drop and three bounced back pretty solidly. When you think about the take-or-pay thresholds that you have and that it does sound like it certainly helped a lot in 2Q and maybe a bit in 3Q as well. I guess, is there a way to think about what percentage of the business is kind of at that watermark or above now where incremental volumes actually do fall directly to the bottom line versus maybe not? Like how should we be thinking about that?
Matt White: Yes. John, this is Matt. I think you may recall when we had spoken last quarter about the 65% of the defensive sales and about half of that is protected contractually. A large portion, in addition to the take-or-pay, also is rent. So the rent continues throughout on the package. On the on-site, to your point, on take-or-pay, we have a few that maybe at that level. In South America, you tend to have a few. You see a little more in certain markets like metals today that are running at lower levels. But these are pretty traditional and consistent of what we have seen in past cycles. So I would say, for the most part though, South America, a few in Europe. And as you look at our working capital performance and our cash flows, obviously, we continue to get paid. And a lot of the reason is because we are connected to top-tier players in those regions and in those markets. So that does insulate us. And we expect that these will come back up as we have seen in prior cycles.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Up next, we have Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Angel Castillo: Thank you. This is Angel Castillo, on for Vincent. Just a quick question on pricing. It sounds like you expect to continue to be positive, very strong in the third quarter here. So just as we think about the fourth quarter, one, what is kind of embedded in the guidance? And two, how should we think about it going into 2021? It's been obviously solid over the last few years, but is that kind of 1% to 2% still the range that you are thinking about? And why maybe the lower end or higher end of that?
Steve Angel: Well, I think, going Q3 to Q4, I wouldn't expect to see much in the way of sequential pricing, because a lot of our price increases are really geared more towards the beginning of the year. So I think it's kind of in the round there. It may end up being plus one. But I am not anticipating that now. And then going forward into next year, every year, we expect to get 1% to 2%. Some years we have got more. If you go back and look historically, but it's never zero. So that would be my expectation next year.
Angel Castillo: Great. Thank you. And then in terms of margin, so you talked about the strong margin in the Americas and some of what drove that. As we look at the coming year, do you expect most of the margin expansion to come in the other regions? And is it fair to think about the current level for the American is rather stable going forward? And if you could kind of give some more color on the other regions on what kind of level of margin expansion we could expect?
Steve Angel: Well, I don't expect to go backwards anywhere. And a lot of the good work that we have put in is going to continue to pay dividends going forward. So it will be stable, at least at these margin levels. But what will lift the margin levels will be volumes coming back. We are still below last year, everyone is. And as volumes recover to something more normal, we certainly expect to leverage that, just like we did from Q2 to Q3. And as far as the margins in the Americas, I mean, you know, again, team is a good job on cost. They have always done a good job on cost. They have always had strong productivity programs. The pricing is there. The commercials terms and conditions, all of those, rental fees, storage fees, take-or-pays, all of that held up exceptionally well. Resilient markets are good for us, healthcare, food freezing, particularly in Americas and also in Europe. So that's what drove that level of profitability. And really, our philosophy here and it's not rocket science, but as we look at all businesses, large and small and we get very granular in terms of how we can improve the profitability of all of them.
Angel Castillo: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we have Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Two questions. Has the focus of cost cutting been in the United States and in the subsequent quarters we will see it more in Europe and in the other areas? And second, in your sequential price improvement, is it broad-based, that is are oxygen and nitrogen prices up sequentially or is it more eccentric and maybe that's to do with hydrogen or something like that?
Steve Angel: Well, there has been some contribution year-over-year from helium, probably somewhere in the order of 25% to 30% contribution to pricing. But sequentially, probably none because that price increases were obtained in prior quarters and we wouldn't see much in the way of sequential help from helium. So the answer to that is really more broad. I have looked at all of our package gas businesses. They have good price increases, good price realization, I should say. Merchant liquid, I see pretty good price realization across the board. So it's not one or two products that are driving all of the price increases. And if it was, it wouldn't be as long-lasting as if we had it broad-based. So we always work on it broad-based. On cost-cutting, certainly in places like Americas, now it's even Asia, we could respond a little more quickly in terms of cost. But we have been doing the same in Europe and it's taken a little longer. As we said in the beginning, we have to work through the process there which we have always known we needed to do. I think the process is a good process in many ways because it forces you to get very detailed and granular in terms of what cost actions you are taking and why. But we have been making good progress with that. And we will continue to do that in EMEA. So one could look at that and say, perhaps there is more opportunity over the long term in terms of operating margin improvement and that's probably the case.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we have Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mike Sison: Hi guys. Nice quarter. Steve, when you think about your earnings growth, 12% in a tough year is pretty impressive. What sort of a cadence of growth and maybe some of the variables, if we ever get back to 2%, 3%, 4% type of global industrial production growth?
Steve Angel: You mean, how should I think about that in terms of margin lift?
Mike Sison: Well, I would imagine the growth to be better than 12%, right. So just I would be curious where that could lead?
Steve Angel: Well, the way I have to think about it is and again we will be back in January, we will give you a lot more color around this. And what I said in my comments were, if volumes are stable and maybe it could get a little help, it don't have to be much, continue to get some pricing, execute the backlog, continue our productivity, that would give me confidence that we will have a double digit earnings growth next year. And obviously, there is a lot of leverage around volumes just as there is around pricing in terms of how that fall to the EPS line. But we will be back to talk more about that later.
Mike Sison: Understood. And then natural gas prices have gone up, maybe it's a little bit more seasonality or whatever. But historically when gas prices go up, it tends to be good for industrial gases. Do you think there is any fundamental potential positives with gas prices up here?
Steve Angel: I think if you are thinking back to some of the old days where natural gas prices got into the $6, $7 range and therefore a lot of our applications like oxyfuel combustion that would reduce the use of natural gas were more valuable. I don't see natural gas prices moving to that point that it would accelerate that kind of activity. $2, $3 natural gas, it's all pass-through on the hydrogen side. So it does make hydrogen a little bit more expensive. And I think if you are trying to think about it in terms of green hydrogen for example versus grey hydrogen. Gray hydrogen prices are really a function of natural gas, whereas the green hydrogen is really a function of renewable power prices and also our ability to lower capital and lower operating cost to make electrolytic hydrogen more competitive. But that's really it.
Mike Sison: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we have Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Steve, you mentioned the medical oxygen being strong due to COVID. Another one of your medical gas is nitric oxide. You have one competitor Mallinckrodt that filed for bankruptcy a few weeks ago. Do you see potential for meaningful share gains with that product? And I know you can't advocate off-label use but docs have the liberty to do that. Are you seeing any growth in that product, just driven to treat COVID patients?
Steve Angel: Well, Steve, you know a lot about this topic. So clearly, Mallinckrodt had practically all the market share at one time, which is why we chose to enter this space. The business is growing nicely. We are seeing nice receptivity to being in the marketplace. Clearly, that competitor, Mallinckrodt, certainly wants to hang on to what they had which is what we anticipated they would do. The growth has been somewhat muted recently because of COVID, right. So you need to get in there, you need to make your presentations, you need to set up the equipment, you need to provide the cylinders. And so, the ability to really have those engagements has been slowed somewhat because of COVID. But as far as the demand, the potential, the excitement, quite frankly, that we are in the business, that's still there. With respect to off-label use, you are correct. We certainly can't advocate for off-label use as our lawyers make it very clear to us. I don't ask the question in terms of how much nitric oxide is being used to fight COVID, for example, though there are studies out there that say that it is effective against COVID. So I really can't answer that question. But I am aware that some of that's taken place.
Steve Byrne: And one on your backlog of sale of gas. What fraction of it would you say, whether it's Asia or your refinery customer base, is tied into either your existing pipelines or an expansion of your pipeline network that represents really an investment longer term for you to enable subsequent projects at a more modest capital cost?
Steve Angel: I would say, the major percent of it, a huge percent of that is tied to existing complexes, enclaves that we were in, that we are able to either extend a pipeline or add to a plant and be able to serve, not only a baseload of customer but other customers in that park. So I didn't add up the percent, but I can look at the large projects and it's a major percent of that $3.7 billion.
Matt White: Yes. And Steve, this is Matt. Even that, to Steve's point, that aspect also helped us win that, right, with our existing asset base and reliability of having that existing network density was also part of our ability to secure those contracts.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we have Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Cory Murphy: Hi. Good morning. This is Cory, on for Kevin. To an earlier question about hydrogen investment, you had said that, you described it as rifle shots. Given the increasing support for green hydrogen, for instance, Chile's government this week put out a plan [indiscernible] geographically, where do you see green hydrogen opportunity that might fit the rifle shot description? Or something like what you did with your plant in California where you upgraded [indiscernible]?
Operator: This is the operator. I am sorry about that. I want to ask Mr. Murphy to call back in. There was a lot of static on his line.
Unidentified Company Representative: No one is here because the participant numbers went down.
Steve Angel: Everybody was kicked off.
Operator: So speakers, can anybody hear me?
Unidentified Company Representative: Chris, are you there?
Operator: Yes. Are you able to hear me?
Unidentified Company Representative: Now we can.
Operator: Okay. I asked Mr. McCarthy to call back in. There was a lot of static on the line.
Unidentified Company Representative: Was it his line?
Operator: Yes, unfortunately.
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay.
Steve Angel: Okay. Let's move to the next call.
Operator: Move to the next question. Thank you. One moment. Up next, we have P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup. Sir, your line is open.
P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?
Steve Angel: Yes.
P.J. Juvekar: Great. First of all, Sanjiv, congratulations.
Sanjiv Lamba: Thank you.
P.J. Juvekar: Steve, I have a question for you. You talked about your hydrogen strategy as being local and in market. Then I look at some of the projects, including some recent ones by fertilizer companies, where they want to take, they want to ship green hydrogen or I should say, green ammonia globally and your strategy seems to be deliberate in market. Can you just sort of just talk about your strategy and what are the risks of shipping it globally as how you see it today?
Steve Angel: Well, I think, it's not that I am opposed to any kind of global strategy in terms of delivering product. What I see is that every country wants to develop their natural resources with respect to what they believe gives them a competitive advantage. And I think if you look at all the countries we are really in today, every one of those countries wants to develop their own renewable power. They want to develop their clean hydrogen infrastructure. And why is that? Well, it's stimulus for their economy. It's employment for their people. It's energy security. So that's why we like to look at this more granularly in terms of what's really going on in the ground and find projects we can get our arms around, we can understand, we can understand the returns, we can have confidence in the investment. And I think that's going to be the best way to go. But you will hear about projects in places like Australia. You might hear them in Saudi or Northern Africa or other parts of the world, Chile, where they think they have an advantage, for example, on renewable power and they want to exploit that. But you have also got to think in terms of all these countries that have an abundance of natural gas. The U.S., Russia, Northern Africa, Canada, Australia, all of these countries who will also look to monetize those natural gas resources and make what a lot of people call blue hydrogen, which can be very cost competitive versus green hydrogen, depending on the cost of natural gas, for example and the comparable cost against renewable power. So you are going to see all of these play out. And the way I think about it is, it's potentially a huge market. It is all additive to us in terms of opportunity and we want to just find the right places to play around the world, in places that we already have a clear investment.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. That's clear. And a quick question on Latin America, specifically Brazil, given sort of the COVID impact in the country and the volatility of Brazilian real. Can you just talk about sort of price and volume trends of what you are seeing there? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Well, what you are seeing in a place like Brazil, it's also across the rest of Latin America, is a high demand for healthcare, a very high demand for medical oxygen. We are the industry leader there. We have been the industry leader. So clearly, we are in an excellent position to serve. And with respect to pricing, we are in pretty good shape. They have historically done a good job and they continue to do a good job, which is why I look at the performance. If you were to look at it, you would say, what COVID? But obviously, the dynamics underneath where healthcare is much stronger, the metals and manufacturing are weaker, is what's really going on beneath the covers. With respect to when the governments will ever address their issues and be in a position maybe to go back to where they have been, that kind of remains to be seen.
P.J. Juvekar: I am sorry. Can you address the FX question because the real kind of took a dive, but it doesn't seem, it's not apparent in your numbers.
Steve Angel: Sorry. I missed that. I will let Matt take that.
Matt White: Hi. P.J., this is Matt. Yes, no problem. You will see and as I mentioned, obviously, the real, the Mexican peso, the Argentinean peso, all took a dive. But as I mentioned, the euro and the Chinese CNY or the RMB helped offset that on a global level. But as Steve mentioned, in addition to those devaluations, you get more inflation than what you would see vis-à-vis some other more developed nations. And that higher inflation, the team has done a great job to recover through the pricing actions to make sure we can stay in line with what's happening on inflation on the ground and they do a good job to maintain their costs. So by getting that positive spread, it helps insulate the business from some of these more significant devaluations and the effects that will have.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And next, we have Markus Mayer of Baader-Helvea. Your line is open, sir.
Markus Mayer: Yes. Thank you. Good morning gentlemen or good afternoon from my side. I have too many questions, but basically add-on questions to what have been asked before. Again, on the helium market, could you give us an update there? How you see potential additional capacities? And how they will affect the market, at least from your side? That would be my first question. And the second question, again, on the project CapEx statements. You have said, it was heavily down in the third quarter and with your assumptions for lower backlog for 2021, what should we expect for project CapEx for 2021? Is there another decline then basically implied in the statement of you? Or should we then also go for non-growth CapEx next year?
Steve Angel: Well, I haven't really looked at the numbers for next year yet and we have some time to do that. But in terms of CapEx spend rate, you shouldn't expect much of a change year-to-year because these are monies that are being spent against projects that we still have to complete. So we will refine that number more going in next year, but it's not like a backlog number that can move around quite a bit based on projects being added or projects being started up. It's much more level loaded in that respect. And you were asking something about potential capacity for Europe. And I apologize, I really didn't pick up the question. Helium.
Markus Mayer: Helium.
Steve Angel: Okay. Helium capacity. Well, so first of all, helium demand is weak as a result of really just the general use of helium but also, fiber optics is down a bit. MRI is probably holding up okay, but not as strong as it could be with COVID. And then electronics would be more of one of the more positive market segments that helium serves. But then again, balloons which, though not a huge percent, very profitable and that's been way down as a result of COVID. So generally speaking, demand has been weak. I think when that turns itself around, again, will be a function, I think, of COVID and when COVID has passed us. With respect to supply coming on, I don't expect to see much in the way of supply until probably the end of next year, maybe even the beginning of following year if we are talking about supply out of Siberia. But I think supply, again, don't expect to see much in the way of supply toward the end of next year.
Markus Mayer: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Steve Angel: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And speakers, that was the last question. I will now hand it over to Juan Pelaez for closing comments.
Juan Pelaez: Yes. Chris, thank you and thanks everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Stay safe. Bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-30 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Linde Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Juan Pelaez. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Chris, thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for attending our 2020 second quarter earnings call and webcast. I’m Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slide and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Steve and Matt will now give an update on Linde's business outlook and second quarter performance and we will then be available to answer questions.  Let me turn the call over to Steve now.
Stephen Angel: Thanks, Juan. Good morning everyone. Matt will cover the numbers which were obviously quite good. But just a few comments. We grew earnings per share versus Q1 and year-over-year despite currency headwinds and weaker volumes. Cash flow was very strong, return on capital continues to improve, operating margins improved in every segment. In other words Q2 is like any other quarter except we had to deliver this one through a pandemic. Safety Performance continued to improve while we battled COVID around the world. Plant reliability is at an all time high. We brought several large projects online. Our hospital and homecare businesses continue to play an important role around the world in the fight against this respiratory illness. We provided a lot of support in our communities through donations and in times gifts. This type of performance doesn't happen because corporate ordains it, it happens because 80,000 committed and highly capable Linde employees do their jobs exceptionally well around the world. Please turn to Page 3. We have talked about what makes Linde resilient in the past, you can see that in a few bursts on the left hand side of the page. The best performing markets in Q2 not surprisingly, were more defensive, like health care, food and electronics. And when combined with our commercial terms and conditions, that guarantees us a steady stream of cash flow irrespective of their respective or volumes. You have what we demonstrated during Q2, a very resilient business. We are not directly part of any global supply chain. We source, produce and sell locally. Our businesses are local and they optimize their cost structure based on local market conditions. Regarding our backlog, it remains firm. We have seen some delays which we are being compensated for, but the backlog has held together well. And it is all for high quality customers you know well. We took additional cost actions in early March to ensure we could deliver the type of performance we could all be proud of. We eliminated discretionary costs. We made sure our productivity initiatives were delivering. We took advantage of every efficiency opportunity, we could find. A good indication of how well the team executed in Q2 can be found in our SG&A results, which were down 14% year-over-year and reached our lowest level 11.9% of sales since our merger. You don't deliver the kind of cash flow we did this quarter without doing a good job on working capital management and when you factor in CapEx efficiencies we generated approximately $1 billion in free cash flow. Pricing continues to hold up well with positive price attainment in every business. So, where do we stand today since our merger closed on March 1st of last year. Operating margins have improved over 300 basis points and return on capital 200 basis points. Earnings per share grew 23% last year ex-currency translation and has grown 11% ex-FX through the first half of this year. And based on our strong and stable cash flow, we raised the dividend another 10% this year which marks the 27th straight year we have increased the dividend and we have no intention of breaking that streak now. If you can turn to Page 4. So what are we trying to accomplish over the coming months and years, what is our core strategy? I broke it down to three simple sections. First of all, we want to continue to optimize the base business. We want to drive network density in our core geographies. We want to leverage digitalization initiatives to drive continuous improvement in every aspect of our business. We want to ensure we have best-in-class price management in every corner of the company. We want to streamline our business portfolio down to businesses, we are confident we can operate the way we want to operate them. We are leveraged to any economic recovery. As I said prices have remained stable. So, all we need is more volume. The increased volume allows us to operate our plants and distribution networks more efficiently. And that SG&A reduction I spoke about earlier those costs will not come back anytime soon needless to say, we will get leverage down the income statement with any improvement in economic activity. We are capitalizing on growth opportunities now and coming out of COVID. I expect to see several opportunities in electronics come to fruition in the coming months. And health care which is 21% of total sales today will continue to grow at a nice say three 3% to 5% clip organically. And though the backlog is coming down somewhat as we start up new projects, the project work between sale of gas and third-party remains healthy at 8.6 billion. The last element of growth I wanted to talk about is one that seems to be dominating always these days and that is clean energy. There is a lot of hype, marketing, and companies that want to burnish their ESG credentials. Some companies are just looking for a way out of their current predicament. And then you have companies like Linde that are actually players in the hydrogen business today. Please turn to Page 5. So, why do we believe clean hydrogen is real? Key countries and regions around the world are leading this leading the charge with regulations, targets, subsidies and funding. You can see a list of those regulations on Page 10. Why are they doing this? It is about de-carbonizing their economies to address the challenges of climate change. Of course, but it is also about resuscitating their economies post COVID. They want GDP growth and they want jobs for their people. And they don't want to outsource their green economy to anyone else. They want to build it all locally if at all possible. The EU does acknowledge, they will need to supplement their renewable power requirements from areas outside the EU, like North Africa, where they also have the ability to repurpose natural gas pipelines for renewable hydrogen. On Page 10, you can see a map of the optimal renewable sources from around the world. Clearly, countries like the U.S. and China have the ability to develop their own sources of renewable hydrogen for their own needs. In addition to renewable, there are quite a few countries advantaged in low carbon sources, such as natural gas that will continue to play an important role in the transition from gray to green hydrogen, as well as in the production of blue hydrogen, where the Co2 is captured in the hydrogen production process. Back to Page 5. There are challenges. First of all, you have to determine how these funding mechanisms will actually work. But more importantly, over the next decade, the cost of clean hydrogen at the point of use needs to drop at least 50% to 60% from where it is today, to roughly $4 per kilogram. To reach that target, renewable power costs need to come down along with the cost of the electrolysis itself. This can be achieved by scaling up capacity, improving efficiencies and developing greater standardization around the supporting infrastructure. This will not happen overnight, but it is certainly feasible within the next 10-years, and something we can directly impact.  Some form of carbon pricing will also need to be in place for clean hydrogen to compete against cheap fossil fuels in some sectors, and the market needs to develop. Especially fuel cell electric vehicles for heavy-haul trucking, which could become the largest target market for a mobility by an order of magnitude. Our clean hydrogen strategy is not unlike our strategy for industrial gases. These markets are local and will evolve uniquely. For example, South Korea and Japan are focused on building their hydrogen economy first irrespective of the carbon content or color of the hydrogen molecule. Green hydrogen will come later when it reaches scale and cost. China's focus on both gray and green hydrogen molecules. The EU wants green now, but privately admits gray or a transition through blue hydrogen will be necessary for a period of time. The U.S. hasn't declared yet, except for California. But the rest of the country will likely pursue all colors of the rainbow, although several are already following California's elite. We want to leverage and build on our existing integrated supply capabilities in each of these regions. In the appendix on Page 11, illustrates our capabilities across the entire hydrogen value chain. I think you could see, we are well-positioned to participate as these markets develop. Emerging technologies like PIM electrolysis technology needs to mature to bring clean hydrogen down the cost curve. We are partnered with leading technology companies like ITM Power to do just that and are already starting to see the benefits of such relationship. So, I will end with the caption at the top of Slide 5. I say this can be a huge market by 2030, what needs to happen. It is a bit of chicken or the egg in the mobility market. You need fuel cell electric vehicle adoption to drive hydrogen growth, but you also need low cost hydrogen and scaled infrastructure to enable fuel cell electric vehicle adoption. If 1% of all energy consumed by heavy-haul trucking today was converted to fuel cell electric vehicles, that would be approximately a $20 billion per annum hydrogen market. The other demands for hydrogen are as an energy carrier, which many consider to be a key enabler for wide scale use of renewable power and hydrogen as a feedstock for industrial use, as well as building and industrial heat. All-in-all, there have been 35 applications modeled for clean hydrogen, about half of which should be competitive by 2030. As I mentioned earlier, there seems to be new entrants in clean energy by the day. Many of whom are non-traditional players in the hydrogen space. But with our expertise, capabilities, local presence, and global reach, I'm confident we will capture our fair share of this market as it develops. That is why I say this will be a multibillion dollar business for Linde. And now I will turn it over to Matt to discuss our Q2 performance and outlook.
Matthew White: Thanks, Steve. And good morning everyone. Consolidated second quarter results can be found on Slide 6. Sales of $6.4 billion decreased 5% sequentially and 11% from 2019 versus prior year underlying sales declines 5% as 2% higher pricing was more than offset by a 7% reduction in volumes. The price improvement was across all segments, and in line with globally weighted inflation. Volume trends include 2% growth in engineering, which were more than offset by a 9% decrease in the gases business. Linde Engineering continues to execute on the high quality contractually secured $5 billion sale of equipment backlog. The gases volume decline is due to the negative economic climate more than offsetting positive contributions from the project backlog. Overall, we estimate the second quarter sales headwind from COVID to be 8% to 10%. Although it is almost impossible to know for certain. Sequentially underlying sales declined 2% as a positive 3% contribution from engineering was more than offset by a 5% volume decline in gases. The estimated sequential impact from COVID is approximately 6% to 8%. You can see that foreign currency continues to be a headwind to sales and earnings. Although the U.S. dollar has started to sell off at the end of the second quarter. If this trend were to persist, it could provide some upside to our foreign currency outlook. Operating profit of $1.3 billion was flat with prior year and down 3% versus the first quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation, operating profit increased 4% versus 2019 and declined only 1% sequentially. The entire Linde team is fully engaged to prudently manage the things within our control and deliver high quality results in any environment. We continue to find more opportunities for productivity and efficiency every day. So we expect to further improve upon these levels. In fact, operating margins expanded 230 basis points over 2019 and 60 basis points over the first quarter. These are real and lasting improvements, well in excess of the temporary benefit from lower cost pass through. Furthermore, these actions enabled us to offset the lower volumes related to COVID which are estimated to impact profit by a few hundred basis points more than the sales effect. Second quarter EPS was $1.90.Excluding foreign currency impact, this level is 8% higher than 2019 and 3% higher sequentially. In other words, we increased the earnings per share, despite an almost double-digit sales decline due to the pandemic. More importantly, second quarter operating cash flow of $1.8 billion was 76% higher than last year, and 31% higher than the first quarter. I will speak more to this on the next slide. But this result is a clear validation of our business resilience and merger success. CapEx is trending downward from a combination of foreign currency, merger synergies, and timing on the sale of gas project backlog, which currently stands at $3.6 billion. It is important to note that backlog definitions are not consistent within the industry. As the Linde backlog represents contractually committed high quality customers with incremental growth. Therefore, we have full confidence the current backlog will continue to contribute to future sales and profit. After tax return on capital of 12.3% represents the highest level we have achieved since the merger date. This is a direct result of our strong commitment to capital discipline and quality growth. In fact, our integrated and dense model across all three supply modes of on site, merchant and packaged gases enables us to enhance returns on each investment, allowing further improvements in our ROC without hindering growth prospects. Slide 7 provides more details on our performance related to cash generation and capital management. The graphic on the left shows our quarterly operational cash flow trend since the merger date in Q1 2019. Recall that these figures represent GAAP operating cash flow. 2020 first half OCF of $3.1 billion is $1 billion or almost 50% higher than the prior year level. Approximately one-third of this improvement is due to lower merger related cash costs. The remaining two-thirds are from higher cash earnings and improved working capital. In the second quarter alone, year-over-year working capital improved $430 million with approximately $110 million from the engineering business and the rest from improved management in gases. These trends coupled with base tax reductions are evidence of merger synergies and efficiencies. You can also see that available operating cash flow is more than sufficient to cover the $500 million quarterly dividend and $300 million to $400 million of quarterly project CapEx spend. The pie charts to the right shows how we deployed capital year-to-date through June. We paid $1 billion in dividends and are committed to growing it every year. Another $1.6 billion was invested back into the business. Quality growth is a key priority use of capital, but each opportunity must meet our investment criteria. Finally, we repurchased $1.8 billion of Linde stock in the first quarter at an average price of $186 per share. You may recall that we paused the share repurchase program at the end of the first quarter to evaluate potential decafs and other higher priority uses of capital. While certain opportunities did not fit our investment criteria, we are still pursuing others, but expect them to take longer to develop than originally anticipated. Furthermore, we continue to have access to very cost-effective capital. As we have recently issued seven and 12-year euro bonds with coupons of 0.25% and 0.55% respectively. Both of these bonds represent the lowest coupons ever for any industrial gas company at these tenures. Given these developments and our continued significant excess cash generation, we are resuming the share repurchase program. I would like to wrap up with 2020 guidance on Slide 8. To better frame the outlook, it may be helpful to describe the second quarter monthly trends. April represented the lowest month, although it was noticeably better than what we originally expected. Subsequently may was better than April and June was better than May. For the entire second quarter, year-over-year volumes were estimated down 8% to 10% from COVID. Although the month of June recovered to about half of that range. Looking forward to the third quarter, we still expect an FX headwind of 3% although current spot rates have improved from this initial estimate. The EPS range of a $1.90 to $1.95 assumes no economic improvement from Q2 at the bottom end and a gradual increase at the top end. We are taking a more cautious approach since the pandemic is still evolving. However, if June conditions were to continue, I would expect to be at the upper end or above this guidance range. Rest assured, that if the economy performs better, we will capture that upside. The full-year guidance range is $7.60 to $7.80 follows the same logic as the third quarter estimate. It assumes no improvement from Q2 at the bottom end and a gradual improvement at the top end. Irrespective of economic conditions, we have a high degree of confidence in the business resilience and growth prospects across our integrated system. Beyond the merger benefits, we continue to find productivity and efficiency opportunities to enhance business quality. In addition, we are pursuing attractive growth prospects through our resilient end markets, unrivaled hydrogen asset network and world-class engineering and technical capabilities. And when the markets do recover, we fully expect to participate and win our fair share. The global Linde team has successfully navigated prior economic crises and each time has emerged even stronger. I fully expect the same for 2020. Now, I would like turn the call over for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with Exane. Your line is now open.
Nicola Tang: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. And the first one was on decap. You have to about healthy pipeline of potential opportunities. And I knew that [Indiscernible] product showed something similar. So I was just wondering if you could update us a little bit more detail about your pipeline might look like and also help us to size the potential opportunity it has a capsule that could be deployed. And again, understanding that it could be sort of longer term view.  And then my second question would be on - you mentioned, Matt, the potential scope for additional efficiency measures that you are also delivering very well on that. Can you put that in the context of your original cost synergies target the $900 million. And I was wondering whether shorter term with COVID, that you have seen any temporary savings for travel cost savings which you would expect to reverse?
Stephen Angel: Okay, well, I will take the decap. And since you gave a second question to Matt, I will let him handle that one or we could give it to Juan or anybody gain, but I will let Matt take that one. So yes, on the decap there is we have a list of projects. The pipeline itself, you could describe as fairly healthy. But then again, the pace is very slow. And that is not unusual. You have customers that are always evaluating their cash flow positions and their needs as you are going through these discussions with them. I expect we will get some to ground but it is not going to be a large number. I don't think and I don't think it is going to be a large number anytime soon. We will do the projects that makes sense for us. You have heard me say this before that, the last thing I want to do is be a lender of last resort. So we will maintain our capital discipline and our return criteria as we work through this. But it is just going to take some time and that is just the way it is.
Matthew White: Hi, Nicole. And as far as your second question, yes, I will start with to your point the $900 million as you recall, on the cost side was the target we laid out there to be achieved over approximately a three year period post the merger dates. As have we stated in the past, the more we integrate, the less frankly, we are able to differentiate between what was considered a true merger synergy and what is just simply being more efficient and productive on how we are running this combined business. So frankly, on an internal basis, we really stopped spending significant effort trying to differentiate between the two. And we are much more focused on just trying find ways to be more efficient and productive operating as one combined company. So to that degree where we really look is more how our operating margins progressing? How is our growth in profits progressing? And how is our growth in cash progressing? There are obviously a lot of other metrics around that, like Steve had mentioned, SG&A as a percentage of sales, what the headcount trends are power efficiency per headcount trends. So we look at those as well. But in the end of the day, I want to see margin expansions. I want to see growth in cash, and I want to see growth in profits irrespective of what we are seeing on the volume side. I think this quarter, we have demonstrated that fairly well. I think last quarter, we have demonstrated that fairly well. And we continue to find even more opportunities every day, as I mentioned. So we are looking in the end of the day to continue to find ways to improve the quality of his business, while leveraging every bit of sales dollar we can to add value. So that is how we will think about it going forward. And that is how we are going to continue to measure it.
Nicola Tang: Thanks. Maybe I could speak in just a quick follow-up on the customer side. And as you mentioned very strong operating cash conversion, and you have talked about resuming the buyback. Would you - are this going to be able to commit to give us a steer on how much you expect to buyback through the remainder of the year, assuming that you want a decap opportunity side, these are now a much longer term?
Matthew White: Yes, and sorry for just answering your last question, which I forgot to mention, on the temporary savings for COVID. As you would expect with everyone, we clearly saw a large reduction in travel. I think that is consistent universally. But what I would say is that the vast majority of savings, as Steve mentioned that we saw this quarter, we expect to retain and maintain a lot of them. So, I'm not anticipating any significant shifts in that. So, that is something we expect going forward irrespective of the smaller temporary ones. On the cash flow related to the buybacks. Yes, we will be back in the market, as we have been will be a participant. As you saw this quarter, we did reduce our net debt again. So we will continue to use it as per our capital allocation policy that any excess cash that we have, after our priorities of growing the dividend and growing the business, we will use in the opportunities to repurchase our stock. And obviously, if there are market corrections, we will take opportunity in there as well, like we did in Q1. So, that is kind of how we are going to continue to manage it and measure it and as this is all underpinned by our target credit rating of a single A. So, we will work within those confines and be back in the market.
Nicola Tang: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Duffy Fischer: Good morning. Thanks a lot for the views on the new hydrogen. So, maybe just kind of a three part follow-up to that. First over like the next five years, what you see is the premium for green hydrogen versus blue hydrogen versus grey hydrogen? Second, as you guys run the most electrolysis units globally? What has your cost done in that space, let's say over the last three years as a baseline, and then what do you have line of sight for your cost doing over the next three? And then the third one is, because it is such a big market, could you see yourself doing something aspirational? Maybe a couple billion dollars of build it no come investment that doesn't have the same surety, that the historic model has had.
Stephen Angel: Okay, Duffy, those three well prepared questions. So, I think the way you need to think about green hydrogen and keep in mind you have the renewable power cost, you have the production costs coming out of electrolysis, you have the distribution costs, you have the cost at the pump. If you are thinking about mobility, so there is a whole chain of cost here that needs to come down and I said 50% to 60%. If you were to call green hydrogen today, coming off electrolysis $6. And so there has to be an assumption about renewable power costs to get to the six. But if you say six, you are making - with $2 to $3 natural gas, you are making great hydrogen for $1. So, there is a tremendous gap today that it would take hundreds of dollars of carbon tax or a carbon price if you wanted to wipe out that entire difference. So, it is a big premier today. That is why I said the cost need to come down the production cost across the entire chain. At the same time there needs to be a carbon price to incent the scaling up of green hydrogen. It is the same thing that happened with solar power and wind power. If you go back and look at the early days, everybody said the costs are through the roof. We can't afford it. But there were subsidies, there were incentives that were put in place that allowed it to scale up and come down the cost curve. So that is the same thing we need to have happened here, and it is going to take some years to do that. We and others are obviously working on that as we speak. I can see plans. I have reviewed plans that show how that can be done. So, I think we just need to kind of wait and see how long it is ultimately going to take. But I think, in a few years the cost will come down quite a bit. But we need to get it down, like I said, 50% to 60% across the entire value chain. As far as what we may or may not do? I mean, we are looking at projects today around the world. I could give you a number. It is like a hundred types of projects. Their slot are very small. Some of them are sale of equipment, a small sale of equipment. Some of them are like projects that we announced in China, and also recently some are a little bigger. But we are very comfortable with the types of activities that we have, the locations that we have them in. It is like 16 countries that are involved in a hundred plus types of projects. So, that really is our strategy. That has been our strategy. We are very comfortable with that approach. I'm not saying I would never do a much larger project, but I would have to be very confident in terms of that is just a good investment that will pass all the muster of it. We always put large project investments through.
Duffy Fischer: Okay. Thank you. And then just one of Matt's comments where if June numbers kind of stayed through Q3, you would be at the upper end to beating the guidance for Q3. Is that imply that you guys see somewhat of a double-dip happening in Q3 and things could weaken or can you talk about July and what you are seeing?
Stephen Angel: Yes. So that is what Matt said. If I look at July's numbers today, I would say it is probably slightly better than June. But then again, you got to keep in mind, we don't really know what is going to happen. I read yesterday that COVID is back on the Continent of Europe. We all know what is happening in Latin America. You can read about what is happening in the South and West, back in Australia. So, I don't really know what the consequences that is going to be. I don't know how governments are going to respond to that this time. Are we going to go back into something like what we saw in March and April and May. We don't know the answer to that. So, it is a possibility. It hasn't happened as of today, but it is certainly a possibility and we have to make sure that we say we are cautious in our guidance and that is what is behind the caution.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Steve and Matt just on FX, if you had mark-to-market today spot rates, what would that imply for Q3 and full-year guidance in terms of upside.
Matthew White: Hey, David. Yes. This is Matt. So as you saw, we have a 3% assumption now. Q3 would get better by a couple percent potentially based on spot. As you know that is a assumption based on spots, but it could get better by almost 2%. And the full-year number would be knocked probably in half as well on that. So, time will tell. We will see, that was based on really yesterday spots, but every day is a different day as you know.
David Begleiter: Very good. And Steve again on hydrogen, are you indifferent to gray, blue or green hydrogen and if you look over that perhaps the next 10-years. How much your project CapEx could you foresee putting forward hydrogen opportunities?
Stephen Angel: Well you are asking me. So I want to be a provider of what the market wants. As I said, there are certain countries around the world today that are building their hydrogen economy first, their hydrogen mobility economy, for example using grade they will transition to green later on. I think - look I mean at the right cost green is going to be preferable for everybody, but you have got to get there first. And that is why we think natural gas is going to still play a role. I mean, we have a $2 billion business today that is essentially all based on natural gas. So natural gas will continue to play a role. Blue will make sense in locations where you have a low cost natural gas and you have the ability to capture the CO2 and do something with it, say make downstream chemical products with the CO2 or you have the right geological formation to sequester in the ground. If those types of situations are present, then you could see what they call blue, which is basically capturing CO2 off of the gray hydrogen production process. But I think everyone would like to get to green, I just think it is going to take some years to get to that point. Regarding CapEx, I mean, if I look at the list of hundred projects we have today, there is probably maybe a couple of billion dollars of CapEx that is kind of been assigned to these projects. Some of them, we have to wait seeing whether they are going to move forward or not. But clearly, if I said hundred and some projects, and if I gave you a number, like a couple billion dollars of CapEx earmarked around those numbers that wouldn't be surprising. But we have to see how fast they move. And at what rate we end up spending against those projects.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Peter Clark with SocGen. Your line is now open.
Peter Clark: Thanks. good morning everyone. I have got two as well. The first one, obviously if I go back to the last recession, I know it is slightly different this time, but you had your earnings flat when you are perhaps Linde had an earnings hit because of engineering, but I guess, actually was flat on EBITDA. And so I look at the difference this time obviously you are delivering on the gases. We expect that engineering is a standout. So I'm just wondering if you can give me your thoughts on the quality of this engineering business you have now probably against what you thought coming in. Because it has been outstanding, I think in the past two years. And then effectively if I look at some of the more peripheral well, very important market for you. Certainly places like Brazil, Mexico and even Australia. How these businesses are performing. You have dominant shares, great businesses to begin with. I think you found a lot more to do in Australia, for example, but obviously Brazil still has the challenges with COVID, or bigger challenges. Just about these more peripheral markets those will get less - still on. Thank you.
Stephen Angel: Okay, so the first question on Linde Engineering. And anomaly speaking is a much smaller percent of Linde today than it was the old Linde AG. It is probably if I go back look about 5% of the EBITDA of our company is Linde Engineering. So it can swing us too much one way or the other. But it is doing quite well, the team is executing very well. A lot of this is picking the right projects over the years. In addition to executing well. A lot of this is they have more gas projects to work on. So we are able to leverage their cost infrastructure much better by adding the practice, sale of gas to the equation. If I look at their backlog today, they probably have close to two years of backlog in front of them to continue to execute. And that is a pretty good place to be. I don't have the order pipeline. I'm not looking at that right now. But the orders clearly are less than the sales for Q2. So, but there are orders coming in. There are projects they are working on, I wouldn't say they are [mammoth] (Ph) projects today, because a lot of those customers are cautious, as you would imagine, but certainly electronics type projects they are working on those are working a lot of smaller projects around, say paper projects. As South America you mentioned that is very advantaged in paper, working on other types of projects. So, there is work coming in there is a healthy backlog. I think they will continue to do pretty well, but if we are sitting here two years from now, and the backlog is a lot lower, then we will have, something to address. But we are very conscious too of our costs, and making sure that we are managing costs very carefully as we are looking at the order pipeline and we work out these big projects. You mentioned Brazil and Mexico and Australia. If you look at South America, clearly they are dealing with COVID. But it seems like they are always dealing with something in South America. But, when I look at their operating margins coming out of Q2 they are at 20%. Probably not many companies operating in South America that are running at a 20% kind of operating margin rate. Mexico has always been a good country for us. We have a very strong presence as we do in Brazil, and we are able to use that to our advantage. In Australia. I talked about an earlier calls Australia, has been on a nice slide path in terms of improving the quality of their business. I'm very pleased with the results that we have been seeing there. And I think, they continue to do a good job in Australia.
Peter Clark: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Bob Koort with Goldman. Your line is open.
Robert Koort: Thank you, Steve, I wanted to ask a hydrogen question. And I guess it is maybe broad, but how do you insert yourself into that ecosystem and how do you get paid. Is it a equipment model? Is it a fairly gas model and big driver for green to ever come about is a dramatic drop in energy prices. So, how do you get aligned with the energy providers, electricity providers, or do you not worried about that, it just seems like may be a much different business model than what you have traditionally done in large scale gas. So, how do you get paid. What is your secret sauce? 
Stephen Angel: Well, I would say, we are going to be participating those ways. And for example, we sell hydrogen refueling stations today, we have been doing that but we are also providing as part of a package offering. If you look at the two announcements that we made in China, for example, One is partnering with the largest green power supplier in China. And we are going to be providing hydrogen refueling stations, we are going to be providing a PIM electrolyzer, and we are going to be providing hydrogen via the molecules. So, that is what the nature of that venture is. But here, we are kind of partnering with somebody different than we might have in the past. It is a renewable power supplier. And this is revive green hydrogen to buses that are going to be operating around Beijing go into the Great Wall and all of that. And then you have got a project in the South, where we have had a JV actually with [Senuk] (Ph) on the industrial gases side for some time. They want to branch out and do hydrogen for mobility. So, we are taking the hydrogen off the refinery. We will clean it up. We will pipe it to some hydrogen fuelling stations. We are providing, and we will kind of build out that market. But that will be a typical sell a gas business model as well. So, predominately to sell a gas that is currently going to be as certainly as what we are interested in, but there will be some SOE type of sales. And I think you correctly pointed out Bob that you know renewable power is a big part of providing green hydrogen. So, the scaling up of wind and solar is going to be key to getting green hydrogen costs down to a point where you close the gap versus conventional. We can only assist in that so much. But certainly, that is a key part of that. And as I said earlier, hydrogen is seen as an enabler to renewable power because one of the issues with renewable power is as everyone knows, it is not as reliable. The windows always blow, the sun doesn't always shine. But hydrogen can be a storage mechanism for energy. And so, that is why green hydrogen actually plays a role in helping enable the growth of renewable power. So, if some of that remains to be seen how that is going to play out, but that is where a lot of the focus is today.
Matthew White: And Bob, this is Matt. Just to maybe add to Steve’s points as part of your question also on aligning with power providers. As you know, we are one of the largest power purchasers in the world today. We purchase terawatts of power and we have actively been working for many years already to improve our renewable energy portfolio. In fact, we have recently got it from 35% up to 38% in this year-to-date. So this has been something that is not new for us. It is something we have been doing for a long, long time. And given that experience, given our local relationships with all of these power producers around the world, it does give us an opportunity to leverage that and helping make this a more successful for green hydrogen. And we are able to connect our technologies and engineering and local presence with these purchase opportunities that we already have today in the relationships.
Robert Koort: That is helpful. And got to say, it is a nice relief to talk about something that is not pandemic related lately. On that regard my second question just curious, maybe in the aerospace business or in the hospitality CO2 business, is there any risks that you might need to take an impairment on those businesses given the fundamental changes in how those businesses are doing or the customers of those businesses?
Matthew White: Yes. This is Matt. No concerns there whatsoever. I mean, the aerospace business book value is actually quite low. We still generate a good profits and as you could imagine that that PSP business is really three businesses in one, it is an aviation, it has an industrial, and then it has an energy that works on things like industrial gas turbines and other forms of more energy efficiency. So, all three businesses continue to operate. This is actually an opportunity for us to consolidate some sites and they are taking appropriate actions in light of the new environment and that has always been a very, very well run business. So, there are no concerns there. And similarly on the hospitality CO2 business, remember that as a high rent business. So, we still continue to get rents on the restaurants that continue to either operate, or will come back and operate again. So while the volumes on Page 17, for food and beverage, were down 9%and that is the CO2 volumes to your point, primarily into the hospitality sector, the rents continues. So this business actually performing quite well in light of what is going on. And then a rebound obviously would be upside. So no concerns on either whatsoever.
Robert Koort: Terrific. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. And hi, everyone. I think you mentioned that there were some project delays in the backlog which I suppose to be expected in the current environment. And that you were chasing compensation for that. Can you just give us a sense of how substantial those projects were and the delays and how is that compensation accounted for in your financial results? 
Stephen Angel: I mean, it can happen various ways, we get the compensation up front in terms of project delays with cash compensation, or it can be built into the final price. Usually you would find it built into the final price. So, we end up with at least the same IRR, if not higher after we go through the negotiations around the delay. Our contractual language protects us very clearly in terms of we commit to a date, if that date gets delayed. And, there has to be compensation to compensate us for that. So that is how it is addressed. And usually, you would see it in higher revenues, margins and cash flow because of the delay to compensate for any changes that we would see.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And just maybe just a follow-up on the repurchases and the guidance. I assume there is very little if any repurchases in the third quarter guidance and perhaps some in the full-year, but probably very little. Is that correct?
Matthew White: Yes. And Vince, this is Matt. We tend not to put too much of this in the forecast just because as you know, it is also a time weighted aspects of depending upon when they are done at what point throughout.  So as I mentioned earlier we will get back to the markets post this call. We will continue to be a participants. And then where we see opportunities we will take advantage of that. But right now, I wouldn't anticipate anything material affecting the share count at this stage.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Michael Sison: Hey guys, nice quarter. In terms of the volume improvement in June and July. Was it pretty even through each of the segments or geographic regions?
Stephen Angel: Well, I would say, as you know this kind of all started in China first and then swept through the rest of Asia. That is why you had some effect from COVID certainly in Q2 as well as in Q1, Q1 China Q2 more of the southern part of Asia. It went to Europe first and then came to the Americas. And of course, we are still seeing some of that in the Americas. But if you were to look at something like China, we saw improvement through the quarter in terms of merchant volume improvement. Our onsite business there has been very stable, quite strong, actually, all the way back to the beginning. Certainly you can look at Europe, you can see the improvement from April to May to June. If I look at the U.S., similarly, you can see the improvement from April to May to June. So really, I guess they go back and answer your question pretty much across the Board. You saw improvement from April to May, June.
Michael Sison: Got it. And then, it sounds like Lincare continues to do well. Can you talk about the returns has that improved markedly? And do you think that do you think that it could be sustainable, longer term? 
Stephen Angel: Yes, it is sustainable, in terms of the level of improvement is probably on the order of 1000 basis points over a couple years. So, the business has been doing very well. We had put a lot of focus on improving the performance of that business, both in terms of improving the margins, lowering cost but also in terms of CapEx management, we change some of the compensation metrics around that. And clearly Lincare is doing well in an environment like we have today where they are an important second line of defense for the hospitals. Months-ago they would not have treated one COVID patient, today they are probably over 12,000 COVID patients that they are handling. The government Medicare has come to the realization that working with us is very important to making sure that patients are transitioned quickly, that the treatment can be provided, whether it is COVID, or other respiratory illnesses, and if they may have 1.6 million patients in total, in a well over a million of those would be would be respiratory type patients. So, paperwork has been eliminated, we have been able to eliminate face-to-face requirements, because it is a very document intensive, paperwork intensive kind of business whenever you are working with a government that a lot of those more bureaucratic processes had been removed, streamline, so we are able to operate effectively and you know the business continues to perform quite well. And I expect that to continue.
Michael Sison: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think I can put my two questions in one. Is the Singapore coal gasification -- Singapore gasification project for 2023, still on schedule, or has it been delayed? And secondly, you said that it is difficult to distinguish your cost reduction efforts from merger efforts. Do you have any margin targets of any kind, maybe your SG&A ratio or your EBIT margin or your EBITDA margin?
Stephen Angel: Well, you know Jeff regarding, I just doesn't come as a surprise, as we look at cost to me $1 cost is $1 cost. I do look at total cash fixed costs as a percentage of sales. That is something I always look at. I look at every RBU around the world, Regional Business Unit, there is 20, some and I always look at in terms of where do I think the appropriate cost where it should be given the type of business that they are in. And then of course, we always demand efficiency, year-over-year. That is what a lot of our productivity projects are about this, but I will let Matthew come back and answer this question as far as other metrics, but that is what I look at very closely. And that is how we drive operating margins along with the normal productivity pipeline and pricing. With respect to any specific project, I would rather not comment on that because you have to keep in mind, there are customers on the end of all of these things that I would rather- they lead with any commentary regarding delays.
Matthew White: Okay. And I can pick up to Steve's point a little more Jeff, on the margin. So I would answer it thinking about it this way. So first let's think about it on an external benchmarking basis. Clearly historically, there has been demonstration and I will talk to operating margins, which I think is an important metric to how we think about it. EBITDA margins, I'm less interested in. The primary reason is because as you know, EBITDA includes the equity income of affiliates, and that is 100% margin every time, because it is not consolidated. There are no revenues. So, that is just a function of how structures and ownership structures, but it really doesn't speak to quality at all. So operating margin is where I focus, that is my effort and that is what I think is the most important of the profitability ratios. So, within that, externally, clearly demonstrated mid-20s for an industrial gas company, even when you look at our segments externally, the Americas, obviously operating mid-20s. So at a minimum on a global basis, there is nothing preventing us from trying to achieve that on our gases businesses across all three segments. Obviously, you will have timing of depreciation. You may have some portfolio differences of packaged gases versus onsite, but irrespective when you add it all together, those are numbers that we want to achieve and that we believe are absolutely feasible and has been demonstrated. Internally, we obviously have a lot more benchmarks than what you have visibility to, and we look at every country and their operating margins, how they are structured, what they are able to deliver. So we have, I would say even more stringent internal expectations on what needs to happen around margin delivery. And to Steve's point, when you look at price, when you look at inflation and when you look at productivity, the inter-relationship between all those three has to be accretive. If that is accretive, it creates a compound value creation and that is why we always are very intent on cash cost pricing and the relationship of those and then obviously inflation in the environments you operate. So, this is something we expect every year to try and improve on our operating margins. And then to your point, other aspects like SG&A as a percentage of sales, sales or profit per head headcount, return on capital. These are things that should improve through this internal operating rhythm and effort. So, mid-20s is demonstrated and that is clearly a goal. And then we want to continue to work better than that on an operating margin basis.
Jeffrey Zekauskas: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. You have laid out on the Slide 10 a lot of the lofty green hydrogen goals for many countries. And you mentioned you are in dialogue with 16 of them. I want to ask you, do you think these countries have a plan for how to implement these lofty goals? Do you see it more as a carbon tax that might have more impact on the industries that could incorporate green hydrogen or the power companies that could incorporate it as a feedstock versus funding infrastructure that could be more used in implementing fuel cell based transportation, which could be much smaller projects versus the former. It would be very large projects and maybe more capital efficient. Do you have a view as to how those two buckets might play out longer term?
Stephen Angel: Well, I think it is going to play out by country. It is going to play out by region. If I look at what is taking place in Asia, I would say that the Asian countries tend to move faster whether you are talking about China or South Korea, Australia, I would put in that in that category, they tend to move quickly. I think we are going to need to see a lot of details or some of these goals that have been, that have been gone public and see how they are going to work. I think that there will need to be a carbon tax, I think there needs to be a significant carbon price. And earlier, I gave a comparison between say a gray hydrogen molecule and green hydrogen as nominally where it is today. So there is a significant difference. I don't think you can charge hundreds of dollars of carbon tax and have a workable solution. I think the number needs to come down overtime. And that would be coincident with again, the cost of hydrogen coming down - from green hydrogen coming down as well.  So those two things are going to need to play out together. And we will see how all of this evolves, but we are going to have lots of opportunity to talk about this as we understand more and more about what each country is intending. All I'm trying to lay out here today is that, we are well positioned in a lot of countries around the world that are going to be active in this space.
Steve Byrne: I was curious about the level of involvement that your engineering arm in this initiative. For example, you mentioned IT Empowers your partner for an Electrolyzer, which they have a two megawatt unit which is certainly suitable for that Germany fuel cell train project that you announced the other day. But, if the big shell refinery in Rhineland, were to convert all of its hydrogen over to green hydrogen the project would need to be a gigawatt of electrolysis. And if your partner has a two megawatt. Is your engineering business involved in designing much larger electrolyzers or involved and in trying to adopt this technology to get larger scale?
Stephen Angel: Well, two megawatts module today, we haven't said what the size of the megawatt module is going to be going forward. So part of this is larger modules. Part of this is scaling up the plants using our Linde Engineering capability so that they can bring all of their expertise to bear around the whole balance of plant, because it is not just an electrolysis module. There is a lot of other supporting balance of plant as part of that as well. And that is all part of how you bring these costs down. So there are some larger projects being discussed. The projects that we are working on today, certainly 20 megawatt, I think they are good sized projects. I like those projects. Some larger projects being discussed. And I think what you will find is that with some of the capabilities that is out there today say around alkaline technology that is like 100 year old technology. They haven't really used it for water in several decades. But that certainly is the intent. My expectation is that the Chinese are going to be very strong players in alkaline building alkaline electrolysis equipment. And I think there is certainly going to be players, particularly as we are looking at some of these much larger scale projects. But right now, most of that is just being discussed. The normal fare of projects is in sort of the 2, 5, 10, 20 megawatt size range and we are perfectly happy to focus on those.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next our next question comes from a line of Geoff Haire with UBS. Your line is now open.
Geoffrey Haire: Just kind of size the scale of a hydrogen opportunity. Currently staffing hydrogens roughly 10% of the sales of the gases of the group. How long do you think it will take before green hydrogen the same size?
Stephen Angel: Before green hydrogen what?
Geoffrey Haire: The same size as hydrogen. Yes. Given the current landscape that you can see?
Stephen Angel: Well, I think we are, that is something that there is a lot of activity today. If I use some of the forecasts that are out there, not necessarily our internal forecasts, some of the forecasts that are out there it says that by 2030, this could be upwards of $200 billion size market. I'm kind of cautious and that I want to see more, first I want to see the market develop. I want to see more projects move forward, but certainly if it becomes that size, we would have no trouble equaling the size of our current hydrogen business today by that timeframe.
Geoffrey Haire: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital. Your line is open. 
John McNulty: Yes. Thanks for taking my question, Steven, in some of your opening comments around the core strategy, you highlighted portfolio optimization, you have a handful of businesses that aren't necessarily kind of industrial gas aligned necessarily. Any chance that we see an ability for you guys to pair those off in the next say 12-months or so?
Stephen Angel: Well, we are certainly working through the portfolio. There is always a long list of activities. We divested a couple things this past quarter. One was a LNG trading business, another one was a small infusion business. So, we are always doing things, we are always making package gas acquisitions and certain kinds of healthcare acquisitions, we are always looking - we will continue to look at. With respect to some of the larger pieces you might be referring to, with COVID, some of the discussions we were having just got put on the back burner, because, potential buyers just aren't in a position to move forward at this time. But those are things that we will continue to look at. We have joint ventures around the world that, we have never been a big fan of joint ventures that we would look to find a better solution than what we have today. So, we can operate these things the way we want to. We are also in some small countries around the world that from my advantage point would have more risk than benefit in being in. So we are looking to prune those as well. But there is always activity, and a lot of times it is just a function of who is on the other end, whether they are ready to move forward or not.
John McNulty: Got it. That is helpful. And then I guess one more question, just there is a lot of talk on the hydrogen side at the same time. There is a lot of stimulus factors we have been hearing about, they are very heavily green related. Hydrogen also is obviously in that vein. Would you say, you are more excited at this point about the potential for carbon sequestration tied to whether it is the green initiatives or the push on the hydrogen mobility market or are you more excited right now about the hydrogen mobility opportunity? How should we be thinking about let’s say over the next five years?
Stephen Angel: I would say right now, the hydrogen mobility is something that is more active. And clearly, if you look at, if you go back to the number I mentioned that if we could convert 1% of all fuel today used in heavy-haul trucking to fuel cell electric vehicles, that is a $20 billion market itself. So, the size of that market is enormous. There is a lot of interest in that, that is what most of the regulations you see today are targeting. China, one million fuel cell vehicles, 1000 hydrogen refueling stations. South Korea, three million fuel cell vehicles, California one million. So the target of these countries, the focus is really around fuel cell vehicles in hydrogen refueling stations. So, I would say that is presents a bigger opportunity. The carbon capture and sequestration tends to be a little bit more one-offs. Again, it is going to be in countries where you have low cost natural gas to begin with like the United States. And as I said earlier, as a country, we are not really moving forward quickly at this point. So, that can change. We can see more of that in the future. But right now, that is the way this opportunity slate is shaping up.
John McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Lawrence Alexander with Jeffries. Your line is now open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. I guess just one last one. Given the scope for project available for the onsite business. How do you think about return on capital hurdles or how do you think that the packaged gas and merchant businesses compete for capital going forward? And do you have any temptation to shift the merchant gas or is it more explicit pricing over volume strategy?
Stephen Angel: Well, we are always looking to balance price and volume. When you are looking at the merchant liquid market. I mean, generally speaking, it is pretty profitable across the Board. But that has to be done granularly. And what I mean by that, you have to look at it customer-by-customer, if you have a low margin account pushing pricing hard, there is a lot of upside. If you have a high margin account, you want to be thoughtful in terms of how you manage the whole price and your expectation around that. So, that is how I think about the merchant pricing in general. That is really how I think about package pricing, but any projects they want to bring forward, clearly it is got to stand on its own. It is got to make good strategic sense from a product and a location standpoint. It is got to meet our return criteria. And the same thing is true back to the onsite. It has to meet our - we have not changed our return criteria. We are still looking for good spreads above our cost of capital and we look at each project opportunity through that lens.
Matthew White: And just to add to that, Lawrence. This is Matt, As you know, we make 15-year, 20-year investments and if you do it right, it could be 50-year or 60-year investments. So we have to think about our return criteria over the long haul. And as you know, often these on-site investments are not two tailed risks, they tend to be one tailed risk to the downside. Because you have liquid advantages, you have performance requirements. So you have to be very thoughtful throughout all the cycles when you make these investments. So that is something that we are not going to change. And every cycle is different. As Steve mentioned today, electronics, mining, things like that are doing well. And with stimulus coming in the year or two that could change the balance of some other industries. So we have to think long range and we always want to maintain that long range view when we make these investments. 
Laurence Alexander: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's question and answer session. I'm going to turn the call back to Juan Pelaez for closing remarks.

The reconciliations of the adjusted numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Steve and Matt will now give an update on Linde's first quarter performance and we'll then be available to answer questions. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Angel: Thanks, Juan. I am very proud of how our employees all over the world have responded during this crisis. Through our business continuity plans, including our remote operating capability, we have been able to continuously serve our customers, while keeping our employees safe. We ramped up supply of vital medical oxygen to help our community hospitals fight this virus. We installed oxygen equipment for emergency and temporary care facilities practically overnight. Our employees performed heroic acts to get critical respiratory equipment like ventilators to people in need. We commissioned air separation plants for Samsung in the middle of this crisis in South Korea. And throughout all of this, we maintained best-in-class safety performance. Our respiratory home care business in the U.S., Lincare has become an important second line of defense to fight COVID-19, providing ventilators to hospitals, transitioning thousands of patients from hospital to home care and maintaining continuous respiratory care for their base of 1.6 million home care patients.  Some of you are aware that Linde has entered the market to provide inhaled nitric oxide therapy to patients in the U.S. Inhaled nitric oxide is most widely known as a treatment for infants in respiratory distress, commonly known, as blue baby syndrome. But more recently, nitric oxide has been used as a treatment for COVID-19 by doctors around the world. This is just a few examples of what we are doing in health care to fight COVID and other respiratory illnesses. I might add that the government does recognize the critical role a world-class respiratory home care company like Lincare provides during a crisis like this. Please turn to slide 3. We have talked about the resiliency of our business for years. Our Q1 results and full year outlook should give you further proof of that resiliency. What is it that makes us so resilient? First of all, our commercial terms and conditions guarantee us a steady stream of cash flow. We serve diversified end markets including; health care, food, beverage and electronics. These markets are more defensive, but also offer nice opportunities for growth. Our business is local. We source, produce and sell our products locally. We are not directly impacted by supply chain disruptions. And because we operate our businesses locally, we know exactly how to align our cost structure with the market realities on the ground. The $9.5 billion of projects in our backlog are all under contract and protected by terms and conditions that lock in a significant portion of our expected return. For example, our date-certain provision guarantees that we will receive our take-or-pay when we are ready to supply our product as opposed to when the customer is ready to take the product. Do we expect to see some slippage of scheduled? Yes, but no cancellations. That would be way too expensive for our customers. Who are the customers of these projects you may ask. They are blue chip companies you know well like; Samsung, TSMC, ExxonMobil, Shell, BASF and Phillips 66. Obviously, no one really knows what this recovery will look like. What I do know is we have a very resilient business model operated by a highly capable, experienced and dedicated global team. If the financial crisis of 2009 is any guide, we held EPS flat ex the effects of currency. And we doubled our free cash flow. And though volumes were down double-digits, pricing was positive. We also raised our dividend just as we have done now for 27 straight years. And we have no intention of ending that streak now. We do have growth opportunities both during and on the other side of this crisis. I have already mentioned a few in the health care space. I expect electronics to remain strong, particularly semiconductors driven by the demand for IT infrastructure, as our economy shifts more towards virtual work, the growth of artificial intelligence and the rollout of 5G communications. We will be starting up our project backlog over the next several years. And we expect to see continued growth from merger synergies. I talked about this in our last call. It is leveraging the joint capabilities of our two companies across a larger global footprint. That includes applications, particularly in more resilient end markets and A to Z portfolio of product line plants and the opportunity to further optimize each plant size from a total cost of ownership standpoint. I also expect to see more acquisition opportunities like decaps. But we have to be selective here. I have no interest in being the lender of last resort. But the most exciting opportunities will come as the world drives towards a lower carbon future, especially green hydrogen for mobility. I expect this alone to become a multibillion-dollar business for Linde. I have said before that, I wouldn't trade places with anybody. That has never been more true than it is today. It's a privilege to lead this company and this team. I will now turn it over to Matt to discuss Q1 results and outlook.
Matt White: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The consolidated first quarter results can be found on slide 4. Sales of $6.7 billion decreased 5% sequentially and 3% from prior year quarter. Excluding foreign currency translation and cost pass-through, underlying sales fell 3% sequentially, but increased 1% over prior year. Volumes fell 4% sequentially, which includes 2% from engineering timing and 1% from COVID impact. The remaining sequential volume decrease of 1% is mostly seasonal from Chinese New Year and Australian LPG sales. Year-over-year volumes declined 1% due to the impact from COVID. Excluding that higher growth from project start-ups and resilient end markets were mostly offset by engineering timing and prior year sales of equipment. We achieved pricing improvements across both periods and anticipate continued positive momentum from a combination of past and future actions. Operating profit of $1.4 billion was flat with the fourth quarter, but increased 11% over prior year. Even with multiple headwinds of COVID foreign currency translation and economic weakness we managed to grow operating profit double-digit percent from prior year. Furthermore, we held this profit equal to the fourth quarter despite these issues and significant seasonal factors especially in the APAC segment. Operating margins of 20.1% improved 240 basis points from prior year and 110 basis points from the fourth quarter. Price and productivity efforts continue to support improvements in business quality despite weaker volumes. As Steve mentioned, we have a very resilient business model, which will serve us well in this uncertain environment. Net income growth was less than operating profit growth, primarily due to lower equity income this quarter. Both equity income and interest expense were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency revaluation of unhedged intercompany loans. While these revaluations had no cash impact they did affect accounting earnings by approximately $14 million of interest expense and $12 million of lower equity income, or roughly $0.04 less of EPS. Earnings per share of $1.89 is flat with the fourth quarter and 12% above prior year. Total COVID impact is approximately $0.05 with roughly half from China and the remainder spread across the world. For the first quarter, most countries include a few weeks of COVID impact whereas our Chinese operations have substantially recovered. In addition, first quarter reflects approximately $0.09 of unfavorable non-cash currency impact versus prior year from a combination of earnings translation and the unhedged intercompany loans. Therefore, underlying earnings growth was quite strong, which is further validated by our cash flow trends. Operating cash flow of $1.3 billion was 26% above last year. Recall, that first quarter tends to be our weakest due to seasonality. So, the year-over-year performance is more relevant. This improvement was driven by a combination of factors, including earnings growth, improved working capital and lower restructuring and merger-related costs. Also, it's important to highlight that this figure is true operating cash flow, not an adjusted figure excluding working capital or other cash items. In this environment, it's more important than ever to manage all elements of cash. CapEx of just over $800 million is roughly split between base and project CapEx. As a reminder, project CapEx, represents capital spend directly attributed to the sale of gas project backlog. This backlog comprises new growth projects contractually secured by long-term fixed payments and terms and conditions that protect expected returns. Conversely, base CapEx represents all other capital spending including maintenance, cost reduction and growth initiatives that are either below $5 million or not secured by a fixed payment contract. Base CapEx has declined almost 20% and we anticipate lower spending the remainder of 2020, which will further support free cash flow. Finally, return on capital continues to improve, now exceeding 12%. Recall, this metric was 10.4% a year ago. So this is a substantial improvement in a short period as we continue to find ways to maximize profit and cash growth, while prudently managing the capital base. Given the importance of cash and capital structure, I'd like to spend a little more time on the details which you'll find on slide 5. The left side of this slide provides our operating cash flow trends since the merger date in the first quarter of 2019. Recall that the first two quarters of 2019 had more merger-related cash outflows in addition to less impact from cost synergies. Overall, you see a growing trend of improving cash from operations especially when considering the inherent seasonality. Beneath operating cash flow, we are subtracting base CapEx. Base CapEx is the normal day-to-day CapEx for operations and small growth initiatives and thus supports the current earnings base. Project CapEx is excluded because it has more acquisition-like tendencies with defined windows of spending for specific customer contracts. Per the Linde definition of project backlog, all projects support incremental growth from secured fixed-payment contracts. We have a high degree of confidence in project returns and we'll readily invest in them when we can. Therefore, we shouldn't penalize free cash flow with contractually secured growth. So a more relevant metric, it's called available operating cash flow or AOCF. AOCF represents the cash we have left over to spend on specific growth initiatives or to distribute back to shareholders. You can see this is a substantial amount of cash recently around $1 billion to $1.5 billion per quarter. Clearly, available operating cash is more than enough to cover the current dividend. In fact, this is what provides so much confidence in our ability to extend the streak of 27 straight years of annual dividend increases. Even after paying dividends, we have significant cash left over and fully expect that trend going forward. We'll continue to prudently and responsibly allocate that excess cash toward attractive growth opportunities that meet our risk profile including our existing $4 billion sale of gas project backlog. And while we purchased 10 million shares of Linde stock in the first quarter, we have temporarily paused the program to reassess the growth opportunities in light of the current environment. While certain customers are restraining future investments, new growth opportunities are emerging in other areas including customer decaps, tuck-in acquisitions and hydrogen initiatives. In addition to stable and growing cash generation, we have a high-quality capital structure with some details provided in the upper right section of the slide. At the end of the first quarter, we had $4 billion of cash. Furthermore, our trailing net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 1.5 times. As a single-A-rated company, we continue to have access to low-cost liquidity through Tier one commercial paper which is backstopped by an undrawn credit facility of $5 billion. Therefore, it's clear that Linde has a very high-quality balance sheet which will only strengthen from the growing resilient cash flow. This combination will enable us to quickly seize upon any new growth opportunities that emerge during these turbulent times. I'll wrap things up with the 2020 full year outlook on slide six. It's safe to state that no one knows how the economy will recover from COVID or what a recovery would even look like. However, we remain confident that Linde has a resilient business model in any macroeconomic environment, including today. To address this dichotomy, we felt the best approach was to provide a scenario-based outlook for the full year 2020. The left side shows the prior 2020 full year guidance of 9% to 12% EPS growth from 2019, or 10% to 13% when excluding an assumed 1% currency translation headwind. You can see at the top that we are updating the currency translation impact to a 4% to 5% headwind. This estimate is based on the weighted average exposure of foreign currencies and the forward rates at a certain point in time. As you all know, this is a non-cash impact and will change with the daily rates, but it represents our latest estimate. 2020 EPS growth rates excluding foreign currency will depend on both, the definition and trajectory of a recovery. For simplicity sake, we are defining recovery as a point when base volumes are down low to mid single-digit percent from 2019 levels. In other words, consistent with our February 2020 guidance, we believe that industrial production levels will experience recessionary conditions even when excluding direct COVID impact. Regarding the COVID effect we are providing two different scenarios of 2020 recovery. To reiterate we are not trying to project the timing of a COVID recovery, but rather are providing two different benchmarks of potential underlying earnings impact. Clearly, there are myriad of paths this could take, but the idea is that investors have a baseline to work with and then utilize their own projections to understand sensitivities. Scenario one, assumes base volumes recover by early Q3 and then stabilize for the remainder of the year at levels which are low to mid-single-digit percent below 2019. Under this scenario, we would anticipate full year EPS excluding currency to increase mid to high single-digit percent from 2019. Scenario two, assumes base volumes don't recover until mid Q4. This essentially means Q2 lockdown effects would carry until the middle of Q4. Here, versus 2019, EPS excluding FX would be flat to negative low single-digit percent. Under all scenarios we are assuming Q2 to be the worst quarter, with the most significant impact from COVID. At this stage we would approximate the sequential EPS decline from Q1 to Q2, could be anywhere from 10% to 15%, depending on the severity of lockdowns and impact of foreign currency translation. This is our latest estimate based on April results and our current thinking on the remainder of the quarter. Finally, the CapEx outlook has been reduced by $400 million, as we see lower base CapEx spending from merger efficiencies and fewer requirements for small growth investments. These actions further support our confidence in growing free cash flow over 2019. In summary, Linde offers an incredibly defensive model, with significant internal productivity opportunities, a track record of growing free cash flow, a high-quality balance sheet and more than 65% of sales underpinned by fixed fees or resilient end markets. This defensive model is further enhanced with significant profitable growth opportunities from our industry-leading project backlog, unrivaled hydrogen portfolio and world-class technical and engineering capabilities. It's true, that we're facing an unprecedented pandemic and subsequent economic retrenchment that could limit global growth for many months or years. However, we remain confident in our ability to provide products and services to make the world more productive and safer, while continuing to drive the organization to higher levels of performance and efficiency. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning, Steve and Matt and Juan. Guys just on decremental margins how should we think about those in Q2 by segment, by region? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Well, I think, if you look at it from a -- just looking at it from a volume standpoint, from Q1 to Q2 we see volumes dropping say low double-digits. And that is what is the basis behind Matt's forecast that we should be off somewhere between 10% and 15% in Q2. So on an operating margin basis, I'm sure there will be some deterioration in Q2, because the volumes are just falling so fast and our ability to get cost out that quickly is not going to be there. Though for the year, I firmly believe we're going to grow operating margins because we'll be able to take out enough fixed cost to make sure that that happens.
Matt White: Yes. And I'll just add David to Steve's exact point. As you could imagine with the local markets, we have a lot of costs and flexibility. So as we adjust those markets to the realities, the second quarter may not reflect the full cost benefit, but you may see some volume reduction, but then we'll get the benefit of adjusting those markets for the remainder of the year in terms of the cost structure.
David Begleiter: And Matt just on those FX impacts impacting equity income earnings and interest expense in Q1 will they continue into Q2 as well?
Matt White: So yes to separate that, the unhedged intercompany loan generally I would not anticipate that. What that is it's based on a balance sheet date. So that's the end of the -- in this case, the end of the month of March. Those currencies have actually already started to appreciate vis-à-vis the dollar. So if anything if those trends continue, it might even be a little favorable in Q2. We'll have to see. But this is again a noncash thing. It actually is just how we finance our various companies and where the functional currency is different than currency we use to finance them. So yes, I would not expect anything to that magnitude going forward and it probably may even be a little bit positive depending upon where currencies go.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with SocGen.
Peter Clark: Thank you. I've got two. The first question now -- intrigued to see electronics you have that down as resilient. I think the -- obviously some started up first phase. I think something in China as well GTA. Wondering how much carrier gases is as percentage of your electronics business?
Steve Angel: Peter?
Peter Clark: Yes? Can you hear me?
Steve Angel: Peter, sorry. We can't hear you. You are cutting off.
Peter Clark: Okay. I'm saying on electronics what percentage would be carrier gases with Samsung starting up and also GTA now? Because I see how it's all resilient. That's the first question. And the second question alluding on the productivity you see for the full year obviously that was the biggest part of the Christmas tree diagram in presentation in February. I think it was 6% plus of EPS to report. I presume you -- we had at a pretty big number, even if you can't do some of the reductions you have planned for 2020? Those are the two questions. Thank you.
Steve Angel: Yes. Well electronics is shown as 9% of our sales based on 2019. That's going to grow as a percent of our total sales. As we start-up our backlog, the electronics backlog starting up the year this is on-site was nearly $1 billion right at $900 million. So as we start that up, we're going to get the benefit of those sales. So a large piece of the electronics is on-site and large piece of the growth will come from on-site again as we start-up these projects. As we look at -- and I always look at total cash fixed cost. And so what does that mean? That's all fixed cost minus depreciation. So all the controllable cash cost. And we've gone through multiple planning scenarios. But where I'm confident we're going to end up for the year is that our total cash fixed cost in 2020 will be lower than 2019 by something in the order of high single-digits, so minus high single-digit year-over-year comparison. That's higher than what we had planned coming into the year. But given obviously what's taking place where the economies have basically shut down in U.S. and Europe for a big part of -- or a piece of March and most of April and kind of unsure how we're going to emerge from this, we thought it was prudent to take those actions. And again, if you go back and listen to Matt's forecast, he's saying that recovery to us. Again, we're talking 2020. So we're acting as if nothing happens going beyond 2020, which obviously there will be. But by the end of 2020, we're saying that the recovery is still below pre-COVID levels. That's just an assumption and it's low single-digits to mid single-digit lower recovery point. Obviously, if the recovery is stronger we're going to participate in that and we're going to capitalize on that.
Peter Clark: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort: Thank you very much. Could you guys talk -- I think you noted in your comments maybe some opportunity for decaps. Are you seeing greater interest in your customers or potential customers doing that in light of pressured economic conditions or maybe crack spreads or something else, or has there not been much change and companies really haven't had a chance to go out there and solicit or consider interest in doing that?
Steve Angel: It's a good question Bob. That was something we commented on. The answer is yes. We are seeing more interest. I think more will come as they think through their financial condition. We're working on something as we speak. But I do expect that one of the opportunities that's going to emerge from this is the opportunity to do some of these decaps. Now, obviously, we have to be careful, we have to be selective we have to make sure that these are world-class assets that we're going to be supplying operated by blue-chip companies. But I certainly expect to see more opportunities than we had in prior years.
Bob Koort: And one other thing I note Steve across sort of the large-cap more defensive chemical names we look at, at least, you guys have probably had the most resilient earnings stream even in light of your scenario analysis but maybe haven't been reported as much from an equity standpoint. I'm curious on two things. One you guys have daily sales runs across your network. Years ago you used to provide us monthly updates. Is there any scope that maybe you could give us some interim quarter updates on whether scenario one or two might be occurring or your expectations for it? And then two, I'm wondering is there any chance as that progresses you could become more ambitious on getting back into the share repurchase activity?
Steve Angel: All right. So, let's -- so I'll take one. Yes, I do think we could probably think about some kind of interim outlook based on -- you are correct in your assumption that we look at these volumes very closely. I look at them. I try not to look at them daily, that's almost too much, but I certainly look at them on a weekly basis around the world. So, yes, we do have an indication of where we're tracking. I think we can come up with something. As far as the share buybacks I think at this point given the opportunity slate we just talked about with these decaptivations and some of them can be quite large. We want to make sure that we have capacity available to take advantage of that. If you go back what we've said countless times is that the priority for our business is to invest in the base business. And we want to invest in core plants core businesses whether it's new projects or decaps. That's what provides the highest return on capital for our company and that's always been our priority.
Matt White: Bob this is Matt. Maybe I could add a little to kind of your question on the outlook. So, obviously, we have April under our belt here. I'd say April came in better than what we initially anticipated. But if you look at our 10% to 15% outlook I mean the worst-case side of 15% would probably have to imply April repeats for the remainder of the quarter. Obviously, if there's an improvement from April you could be at the 10% or better layer. But at this point we'll have to see where that goes. But I think that's how we think about the sequential look and it's very fluid. It's something that we have to keep monitoring. But that's how we think about looking forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.
John McNulty: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. When we look at the project CapEx that you laid out is there a way to think about what portion of that's tied to the smaller projects the ones that are sub $5 million? And how should we think about the returns on those whether they're kind of in line with the general return profile of the larger ones or are they above or they below? How should we think about that?
Steve Angel: Well, I think to Matt's point most of the degradation and reduction of $400 million or so is in the base side. With respect to large projects, obviously, those returns are locked in. It's a question of do we slide a couple of months from anticipated start up? The base has everything in it. So, it has maintenance. It has safety. It has small projects everything. But large project falls into the base category. I don't anticipate -- I have approved a couple of projects here recently. So, it's not like the world came to a total end. And so there are pockets of opportunities small on-sites that we continue to see that are very good projects. Nothing has changed in the return profile. So, there's still good returns. But it stands the reason that we're going to see less of those in this economy.
Matt White: And John just to add to that. As you know a material portion of the base CapEx was related to growth. And within the growth I'd put it almost the two basic buckets. Those that exactly what you're referring to these small standard plants under $5 million. To Steve's point, we're still seeing opportunities. We're still seeing growth. So, that's an area that -- it will be slower, but it's happening. But also the other part of that growth would be tanks, cylinders, trailers, a lot of the transportation and storage equipment that relates to growing either liquids or cylinders. That's an area we would anticipate in this environment to be less because we will be able to have a current large asset base that we can already utilize. So, I would anticipate even more decline in what I'd call transportation and storage components of growth than probably some of these small on-sites.
John McNulty: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up. So, you commented in the beginning remarks around Lincare and the opportunities there and the support that you're giving. And one point that you made was that the government truly appreciates this. I guess can you flush that out a little bit? I know this has been kind of a business that, maybe there were question marks in terms of whether it's fit in the portfolio or not. I guess how might that be, evolving at this point?
Steve Angel: So this is a business, -- Lincare is a business that reports directly to me. And it has since the beginning of the merger. And coming into the merger, I was looking at it very carefully. And I felt that, the trend line coming out of 2018 was starting to turn up a bit. And in 2019, the results that were delivered were better than 2018. And coming into this year as we were building up the plan we felt 2020 would be better than 2019. And as I sit here today, given all that's going on with respect to COVID yeah, I'm very confident that we're going to have a solid year in Lincare. And what I really mean about the appreciation side, if you -- we've all been listening to the news trying to flatten the curve with the health care system, so it's not overwhelmed. Part of that is they need ventilators, they need IC beds. And what we do from a home care standpoint -- it's a respiratory home care business. So we can provide a lot of these products, a lot of these services. And we're there to take the patients coming out of the hospital to relieve the hospital of that pressure on capacity and treat those patients in a home environment. So, that's something that the government the Center for Medicaid -- Medicare & Medicaid Services, recognized early on to their credit and they have been working with us to facilitate the transition of patients, to make sure that the documentation and paperwork is not getting in the way, to relieve the requirements for face-to-face transactions, which has been something that they've required historically, because they know that doesn't make sense in this kind of environment. So our ability to really step up and provide a needed service, in a critical time for our country is there. And Lincare has been able to step up and do that. It would be hard for a lot of smaller home care companies do that, because they just don't have the capacity. They don't have the ability to flex. They don't have the resources. They don't have the complete repertoire of equipment and clinicians and technicians and all that. But that is what Lincare brings to the equation and at an important time. So, clearly, they have demonstrated their value and are demonstrating their value to me and to the company this year. And I think, going forward, that's likely to be the case. Again COVID-19 is a respiratory illness. And that is our specialty respiratory care. So I'm certainly feeling much more positive about this business. And I think I said that in the beginning that I wanted to spend some time to look at it, to understand it, see if we can improve it, what the outlook is. And it's pretty positive today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Steve, maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about the decaps and I guess maybe the angle I'm thinking about is, just -- I assume just like large projects there's going to be competition for decap. So maybe just talk about, where you think your edge is. I assume some of it has to do with density some of it has to do with engineering. But how do you think the winner of these decaps is going to be decided? And from your own perspective, how do you think about hurdle rates risk profiles versus a similar dollar amount for a large project that might be out there?
Steve Angel: Well. I'm not going to think about hurdle rates any different. And I'm not going to think about risk any difficult going into this. I think there will be cases where there is competition. There will be cases where we will be a supplier in a complex. And we would be the natural partner to decap an existing asset and it will just be a negotiation between two parties. And I think the same is going to be true for our competitors. Clearly, -- so where that's the case that's where the opportunities will come. Clearly, Linde Engineering has built a lot of plants all over the world both ASUs and HyCO plants. And we have that list and so we know exactly where they are. And we'll go through that screen to determine which ones we're interested in and which ones we're not.
Vincent Andrews: And maybe just as a follow-up on your leverage level. I know, we've been having this conversation in prior quarters but obviously the world is a bit different now. So has anything changed about your willingness to lever up the company? And does it matter whether it does decap to cash flow right away versus large projects with buybacks?
Matt White: Hi, Vince, it’s Matt. Yeah, I start with the standard basic part of our capital allocation policies which we're going to maintain an A rating right? We're absolutely committed to that. And the nice thing I think about the capital policy, we've laid out is, it's going to be the same throughout any environment. And this is no different. So as you may recall, our approach is maintain the A rating. We want to raise the dividend every year. And our priority always is good growth projects that meet our criteria. Whatever is left over goes to buybacks. And to the points we made in the prepared remarks and Steve's points, we are seeing a different landscape of growth opportunities now in light of this environment. We want to understand that and assess that. Hence we've paused the buyback program. Now that the potential growth opportunities are changed and some especially things like decaps will have more different cash profiles than you would on normal projects, we just want to assess it and understand it. So our capital allocation policy has not changed at all. Our view on the desired credit rating and appropriate debt levels has not changed at all. But this environment has created opportunities where -- that did not exist prior and we want to make sure we assess that and understand that.
Vincent Andrews: Thanks very much guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning guys. Glad you all sound healthy. In terms of Q1 just, sort of, curiosity, the adjusted EBIT was up 11% and -- no I'm sorry. Yeah, adjusted EBIT was up operating income was up 11%, yet EBITDA was only up 4%. Can you walk through the difference there and how that will flush through for the remainder of the year?
Matt White: Yeah, Mike this is Matt. I'd be glad to answer that. You may recall in the second quarter of 2019 when we had this call, I had discussed the sequential Q1 to Q2 EBITDA walk and we had had a presentation -- a format change. As you may recall, we didn't officially merge till March of 2001 -- 2019. So there was a presentation format change that was prospective going forward the same but on the year-over-year this effect is happening. So simple answer is there's probably around 4% or so of other re-classes. It was just a line swap between fixed cost and EBIT and DA. So it's a zero net effect operating income but it's a line swap between fixed cost and DA. So that's probably another 4% or so. In addition, I discussed the equity income impact we had on the noncash unhedged loans. As you know EBITDA, the calculation has equity income in it. So that's probably another percent or so; again noncash but just an impact. So you're probably really -- on that basis EBITDA would maybe be 9% or so. And the only difference then between the 11% is depreciation is a little lower. But I would just say most people use EBITDA as a proxy for cash. And I think it's better just to look at cash. And operating cash flow was up 26%. So from my perspective, I'm less concerned about some of these pocket switches and EBITDA effects and I'm much more interested in what's the operating cash flow trend. But going forward you won't have this effect anymore. As I mentioned that was a one-time thing in Q1 upon the merger adoption. So I'm not -- no concerns going forward.
Mike Sison: Great. And as a quick follow-up, last quarter you had a nice EPS waterfall chart. When you think about the positive, the savings like 6% or so then pricing was a couple percent. Stock buyback was couple percent. Maybe that's a little bit lower and then project backlog was couple percent. Are those positives still intact? And I guess that implies something like mid-single-digit declines in your base case for demand and then maybe 10, 11, 12 who knows in the bear case. Is that kind of the way to think about it? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Well, I think approaching the elements is the right way to do it. And the project backlog, we've said it looks like 2% top line, bottom line growth this year, next year, the following year. And I think that's close enough. Pricing I think if you go back and look at the last -- the Christmas tree chart we all call it now, but it looked to be around 2%. I see nothing that's going to change in my view of that. And if you go back and look at us historically too even when volumes plummeted we're always able to get positive pricing. So I don't see that changing. The cost side will be higher. We'll get more cost out this year because that's the environment that we're in and that's what we need to do. The big difference -- so the two big differences are FX, which Matt talked about. And then if you take FX away then it's volume. And so everything hinges on volume. And so we laid out two scenarios for you, you can come up with your own scenarios. Whatever we laid out probably won't be correct, because if you go back and look at what we understand about this disease, I think clearly today it's different than what we thought about it 30 days ago. So this thing will continue to evolve. And again if the volumes come back faster if we're rocketing into next year, we'll do exceptionally well.
Matt White: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to Steve's point a lot of people throw the word recovery around. And I just ask that -- ask them what recovery means, because recovery means something different to everybody. No one knows what it will be, but we did our best effort to define it. We define it as actually some recessionary conditions. So I think that's an important thing too is what even is a recovery and then when do we expect it.
Mike Sison: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with Exane BNP.
Nicola Tang: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Actually it ties on quite nicely to that point you just made on recovery. I think in your opening remarks, you mentioned that actually you had seen a decent recovery in China. So I was just wondering if you could talk about how China today is tracking versus more normal conditions. And then just on the engineering business. In the slides you mentioned that the sales decline was driven by project timing. I was wondering to what extent that was due to disruptions related to coronavirus not being able to get on-site versus like longer term project delays? Thanks.
Steve Angel: Okay. So let me take -- I'll start with China. Looking at the volumes today coming out of April, it looks like merchant liquids in the high 80s, probably tracking 90% now. Not back to 100% pre-COVID levels yet, but obviously, the trend is more positive. The issue in Asia now is that it's the same problem that we had in Q1, in China is now Q2 in places like India, Southeast Asia to a lesser extent, Australia. The on-site business Tier 1 steel suppliers took a lot of oxygen throughout the downturn, throughout Lunar New Year, throughout COVID. I think the -- what we have to watch for now going forward in this year is that we're not building a lot of inventory that it is going to get absorbed. But it's a good time to be partnering with Tier 1 suppliers in China. The chemical side of the house it kind of ranges. I'm looking at numbers from 70% to 90% of pre-COVID levels. And some of that's going to depend quite frankly on how quickly China recovers economically and the export order book will drive the chemical side of the house. But clearly, it's come out of this COVID period as everyone has been reporting that you've listened to and that continues. On Linde Engineering, obviously, there are some challenges executing projects. I would say nothing substantial at this point. The whole virtual management that they embarked on just like we did here and many other companies have done has worked pretty well. So in terms of project delays and things like that, I haven't really seen it yet. And everything seems to be tracking. It wouldn't surprise me if sales do slip a bit. But the order backlog is firm and that's the most important thing at this point.
Nicola Tang: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.
Duffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning guys. Steve you had referenced kind of the recession of 2008, 2009 and how well the business did through that both EPS and pricing. Looking back at that versus what we're seeing today what are the pros and cons of using that as a template as a guide as we go through? So for the merchant business what might that mean? And then because you didn't have the engineering business back then maybe walk us through what that business could look like in a recession in your mind?
Steve Angel: Yes. I didn't have Linde Engineering business, but I also didn't -- I also -- I might have still had a small home care business in the U.S. but nothing on the order of Lincare. So you have some of those counter dynamics as well. Back then volumes, I believe in the U.S. dropped about 12%. I think worldwide, we were down about 10% for 2009 versus 2008. Again, pricing was positive, very similar reactions. Pipeline volumes in the U.S. fell precipitously during the financial crisis. They went down pretty quick. We saw the same thing happen here with COVID. When you shut down your industrial base in the United States you see pipeline volumes start to drop precipitously as well. Merchant liquid volumes fell a lot back in 2009. They fell a lot looking at April here as well. So, obviously, different crises, but the impact is very similar on volumes and where those volumes are affected. Again, I think Lincare is going to have a very good year no doubt about that. As I look at Linde Engineering, the fortunate thing for Linde Engineering is, we closed a very large order coming into this year. And their third-party backlog is $5.5 billion. That's two full years of sales, they have sitting there in the backlog. And in addition to that, they are doing the engineering work for the other $4 billion or so of sale of gas. So they're in a much, much different position than perhaps they were historically huge backlog, sale of gas plus third-party to absorb the engineering cost work. And I'm not worried about Linde Engineering this year for sure. And I think we'd have to get well into next year, and with an order outlook that says orders have really dried up before we would start to see some pressure on Linde Engineering, and then we'd have to go to working on some of the cost a little more aggressively. But today they just have a big backlog they need to work off and execute and that's going to sustain them for a while.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thanks. And then just on your comments around decaps the opportunity set SMRs versus ASU versus others. What does that look like in your mind over the next year or so?
Steve Angel: I think that's an interesting question. I think obvious -- I would say, that we'll see both -- maybe a little heavier on the ASU side, but I think we're definitely going to see both types of opportunities. Obviously, if we're talking about SMRs it's going to be hydrogen or syngas or CO for refining either in the U.S. or around the world -- other parts of the world. And then ASU, I think would be those opportunities are going to come up. I'll just stop there.
Duffy Fischer: Thanks, guys. Be safe.
Steve Angel: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. So one of the debates after the merger was the cultural integration and the resilience of the two cultures and how well they would work in a crisis. Now that we're in one, can you give some perspective on both positives and also maybe just specifically addressed have you – needed to replace staff in the senior levels in any regions or product lines as part of the – over the last six months? But also can you address sort of just what you've been pleasantly surprised by or what's worked what hasn't?
Steve Angel: Well, I think that's a good question. Obviously we've been in the middle of this for a couple of months and even a year plus going back to the beginning of the merger. But I've been quite pleased, very satisfied with the response I've seen from everyone around the world not to differentiate between legacy Linde or legacy Praxair or legacy BOC or legacy whatever, because we have various groups in the new Linde plc. But – because this isn't my first rodeo, as soon as we started to see things unfolding the way they did, I basically went back and pulled the playbook out of 2009, took a good look at that, refreshed that, got that out to everybody. I think it's important that we all get grounded early in terms of what needs to be done, what pace it needs to be done. And I'm very pleased with the response that I have seen really from everybody around the world.
Laurence Alexander: Thank you
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.
Steve Byrne: Yes, than you. A couple of months ago, Matt you were talking about – at the beginning of this pandemic, as it was unfolding you expected to learn how to be more productive, something to that extent. And I just wanted to see whether you were able to pull forward any of these productivity initiatives that we feel like maybe have been set at – to relatively modest levels. Are you able to pull forward because of any disruption going on at the governments or workforce? Anything along those lines that we could expect greater cost synergies going forward?
Matt White: Yes. And maybe to learn more productive, I'd maybe just say there's probably more productivity opportunities. I agree with that absolutely and I think the prior conversation we had. And I think it's to an extent what Steve had said in his earlier remarks that we're a very, very local business. And obviously, we have a set of opportunity of some efficiencies that we were already undertaking with the merger. In conjunction with that as the dynamics change in our local businesses, we need to adjust and adapt with our cost structure. On top of that when you get in an environment like this, there's just a bit more of a burning platform. And I think that burning platform helps – even to Laurence's question earlier, it actually brings the culture together faster in my opinion. And we're seeing that. And so I think you find more opportunities, people become more creative and the local markets require maybe cost structures that might be a little different. So you add all that together, yes absolutely, there's greater productivity now than what we originally anticipated in the beginning of the year. And we just need to act on it in all capacities. And it's across all fronts. And it's not just people, it's lots of different things. And so I think this is what we are actively working on. And we feel there's a lot more opportunity that we're going to continue to work towards and we should be seeing the benefits in our results throughout the year and into future years.
Steve Angel: So I'm going to add one thing then we'll take one more question I think, Juan, right? So everybody is going to go through what are the implications of COVID strategically speaking going forward? And what are the implications to your company what are you going to do different? We've already alluded to a couple of things throughout this. Being a local business, not directly impacted by supply chain is good thing for our business. We've talked about the importance of health care being in resilient end markets. We've talked about decarbonization opportunities, hydrogen. We're going to see that going forward. But another implication that I think relates to your question is digitalization and the ability to operate plants remotely, the ability to monitor plants remotely, the ability to diagnose what's taking place, preventative diagnostics, predictive maintenance. All of those capabilities are going to be even more important, not just for us but for other companies going forward. And that – I've always viewed that as mainly a productivity opportunity for our company.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup.
Kara Enomoto: Good morning. This is Kara Enomoto on for PJ. I was just hoping you could possibly compare and contrast what you saw in China in Q1 with maybe the cadence of declines and a recovery in the Americas, EMEA and other parts of Asia. And while I know you can't get too granular I was wondering if you're starting to see any positive or stabilizing signs in any of those regions?
Steve Angel: Yes. I think China, obviously hard stop and then reopening instant stimulus from the government. And clearly, they're coming out of this fairly quickly. I think for Europe when I look at the merchant liquid volumes for Europe in April just to give you that number, it's off 15%. But as I look at the industrial volumes it looks to me like maybe the last week or two in April we're starting to see a little improvement from that. If I were to look at the United States merchant liquid volumes are off like 20%. Sitting here today, I haven't seen any change week-to-week in that number. And if you think about it China went first coming out followed by Europe maybe starting to emerge from that and then the U.S. is still kind of behind and more at the bottom of the curve at this point. So we'll see.
Kara Enomoto: Okay.
Operator: Management the floor is yours for any closing remarks.
Steve Angel: Yes. Just thank you again, for everyone participating in today's call. Like always, if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a great day and stay safe.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-13 07:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Q4 and Full-Year 2019 Linde Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you, Daniel. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for attending our 2019 fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. Once again, this is Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations, and I’m joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer, and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today’s presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of adjusted pro forma numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Steve and Matt will now give us an update on Linde’s performance including 2019 highlights and our new 2028 sustainability targets. We will then be available to answer questions. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Angel: So if you had told me a year ago that this is where we would be today as a new company, I would have been delighted. We had the plans in place but we had a lot of work to do. And I’m pleased to say the team executed beautifully. A few financial highlights for the year. We saw underlying growth of 4%, half price and half volume. Operating margins climbed nicely 160 basis points to 18.7% and earnings per share grew 23% ex-FX. We had strong cash flow for the year, especially in the second half, which is always a good sign of a healthy and improving business. I’ll let Matt expand more on that. And with the strong cash flow, we invested $4 billion back into the business in CapEx, half for contract a large projects, and returned $8 billion to shareholders between dividends, share buybacks and the squeeze out of our minority shareholders. And return on capital, the single most important metric for any capital-intensive business, rose 130 basis points to 11.6%. We also reached a record backlog of projects, $4.4 billion for our sale of gas business and $5.7 billion for our third-party engineering business, $10 billion in total. I’m pleased to say that we won practically every project we chose to pursue. This provides the foundation for growth in future years as we bring these projects online. And with respect to integration, it’s largely done. We conducted our first employee survey and we were pleased with the overall results. This is a good indication of how well the team integrated two high-quality companies in a relatively short period of time. We began implementing our strategy which is to build network density in core industrial gas geographies, leverage our significant advantage in engineering and technology to win more than our fair share of sale of gas opportunities, and capture the full value of the merger, which includes cost and CapEx efficiencies, and growth synergies. And it is the latter that we are getting more and more excited about every day. Coming out of this year, we definitely expect to see additional growth from merger synergies on top of base industrial production, price and project start-ups. And beyond that, beyond the typical three-year kind of post-merger phase, I believe the greatest and most enduring value created from our merger will come from the sharing of our collective knowledge, experience and capabilities. We also want to establish a strong foundation of operational excellence. Our safety performance continues to trend positively with best-in-class performance in many categories. Another key priority for this year was to implement a robust productivity initiative, and we made a lot of progress toward that end. Productivity initiatives need to be revitalized from time to time and we see the expansion of our digital tools and capabilities driving continuous improvement in our company for years to come. Let’s talk about 2020. Yes, it is an uncertain world. We gave you a chart in the back, so you can understand our exposure on a country-by-country basis. It’s never a bad idea to have nearly a third of your sales and operating profit in the United States. It is a good time for me to remind you of the resiliency of our business model. We generate strong cash flow through the economic cycle. When the economy is strong, we invest more in CapEx for growth. And when it is weaker, we return more of that cash to shareholders. Add to that the value created by our merger, and you can see why I am confident in our ability to continue to generate double-digit earnings growth. Regarding climate change. Everyone wants to know if you’re part of the problem or part of the solution. Here at Linde, we are definitely part of the solution. We have a long track record of success and sustainability, having been recognized in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index chemical sector for 17 consecutive years, the only chemical company in 2019 that can make that claim. We are also aligned with the aspirations of the Paris climate accord. However, this requires many parties, government, industry and society as a whole to come together and play an active role. I can tell you that as a leading industrial company, we will certainly continue to do our part to make our more sustainable. In fact, that is our mission statement, making our rural more productive. Through our solutions, technologies and services, we are making our customers more successful and helping to protect and sustain our planet. At Linde, we make products that are beneficial to our environment and society as a whole. In fact, over 50% of our sales today come from our sustainability portfolio that is products that bring environmental and social benefits. We make high purity oxygen for medical needs and to purify water for drinking. We produce krypton that is used for insulation. We make nitrogen that helps keep our customers' operations safer. We manufacture coatings for turbine blades that make aircraft engines more energy efficient. And we make hydrogen to desulfurize and decarbonize transportation fuels to meet ever-stricter environmental standards. In terms of greenhouse gas impact, the products we provide enable our customers to avoid more than twice as much greenhouse gas emissions as Linde emits as an entire company. That is a track record we are proud of and we certainly want to continue to live out our mission statement of making our world more productive. But in addition to that, we want to set new sustainability goals. By the year 2028, which marks 10 years from the date of our merger, we will invest at least $1 billion in new decarbonization capital projects. Examples of that would be carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen mobility like the agreement we just signed to build hydrogen refueling stations in South Korea, green hydrogen projects for industrial customers and hydrogen to produce renewable fuels. We will spend at least one-third of our R&D annual budget on decarbonization. We will continue to develop industry-leading technologies like dry reforming, which uses CO2 as a feedstock in lieu of steam to produce syngas. This is a technology we developed in conjunction with BASF. And we want to continue to advance our own carbon capture technologies to make them more economically viable. We will continue to invest in promising green hydrogen technology like our $50 million investment in ITM to scale up their electrolyzer technology for industrial and hydrogen mobility applications. We will double our annual purchases of renewable power. How much is that, you might ask. Today, we buy about 16 terawatts of renewable power or about $1 billion of renewable power purchase each year. That is enough electricity to power 4.7 million homes here in Germany. And our goal is to double the amount of renewable power we will purchase. As a result, we will lower our greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 35%. Why not more, you might ask. We would love to, but that’s going to be a function of the availability and reliability of renewable power, which is far from certain today in many of the countries we operate in around the world. I can tell you that everyone at Linde, all 80,000 of us, are excited and passionate about what we can do to make our world more sustainable. And now I will turn it over to Matt.
Matt White: Thanks, Steve. And good afternoon, everyone. I’d like to start by providing a summary of the fourth quarter results, which can be found on Slide 5. Sales of $7.1 billion increased 1% over both prior year and third quarter. Versus 2018, underlying sales improved 3% due to 1% more volume and 2% higher pricing. Price improvements are broad based across every region and in line with global-weighted inflation rates. The volume increase is mostly driven by project start-up activity, as organic volumes were relatively stable, due to growth in Americas and engineering mostly offset by weaker economic conditions in Europe and South Pacific. Furthermore, Asia volumes declined from lower activity in the electronics end market and prior-year equipment sales. Comparing to third quarter 2019, underlying sequential sales improved 1%, primarily from timing in the engineering business. Note that we continue to experience positive sequential pricing, but the rounding has resulted in 0%. We have included more detailed information in the appendix, including Slide 10, which provides 2019 sales by key geography. This information is intended to clarify Linde country exposure and the overall portfolio mix. Two points to note on Slide 10 are that gases and engineering account for 84% and 10% of global sales, respectively. And that the top 12 gas geographies represent over three quarters of global sales. These top geographies are comprised of 10 different countries and two sub-regions of Continental Europe. Referring back to Slide 5, operating profit of $1.35 billion or 19% of sales, increased 17% from prior year and resulted in 250 basis point margin improvement. This margin expansion was largely attributed to the significant productivity efforts from all employees managing local price and cost inflation. Sequentially, operating profit declined 3% and operating margin decreased 80 basis points. This decline was anticipated due to timing of engineering project completions. However, sequential operating margins increased in all geographic segments as management actions continued to improve business quality. Year-over-year EPS improved 25% compared to the 17% increase in operating profit. The difference relates to how we have been deploying the divestiture proceeds, either to reduce net interest expense or lower share count. The balance sheet still has significant cushion versus our target A credit rating. So we have ample dry powder for both growth investments and distributions back to shareholders. In fact, you can see that fourth quarter operating cash flow of $2.2 billion is 16% above the third quarter and represents approximately 105% of fourth quarter EBITDA. Obviously, a very strong cash performance, which I’ll speak to more on the next slide. CapEx increased 6% sequentially due to base CapEx. This increase was primarily driven by growth investments that do not meet the backlog criteria such as small on-site plants. And as a reminder, base CapEx represents any capital spending that is not directly listed in the $4.4 billion sale of gas project backlog and would include maintenance, replacement and other growth initiatives. The last figure shows return on capital, which is one of the most important metrics for this industry. It improved 40 basis points from third quarter and 130 basis points from 2018, due to pricing, cost management and project contribution over a relatively stable capital base. Please turn to Slide 6 for further details on 2019 full-year cash flow. The left side shows operating cash flow by quarter, summing to $6.1 billion, including $0.8 billion outflow related to one-time merger and restructuring payments. You can see a substantial improvement from the first half, which averaged $1 billion per quarter, to the second half, which averaged $2 billion per quarter. There are three primary drivers to this improvement. First, as anticipated, the merger-related cash outflows reduced from $516 million in the first half $287 million in the second half. In fact, the fourth quarter had only $92 million as we expect this number to continue to decline. Second, there is inherent seasonality in the cash flows due to timing of cash bonus, tax and interest payments where first half has more outflows than the second half. Finally, the improved operating results and working capital management supported stronger cash flow in the back half of the year. Looking ahead, I still anticipate full-year operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios in the high-70 percentile to low-80 percentile range, after adjusting for any merger-related cash outflows. The combination of the $6.1 billion operating cash flow, $5.1 billion divestiture proceeds and $0.4 billion, primarily from debt, provide $11.6 billion of capital available for deployment in 2019. The pie chart to the lower right shows how we allocated that capital, with almost $8 billion going to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, including the one-time merger squeeze-out payment. We also reinvested $4 billion back into the business, with half supporting secured growth. Overall, the very strong cash generation in 2019 coupled with a disciplined capital allocation process enabled us to pursue all opportunities that met our investment criteria, while returning the surplus to investors. I’d like to wrap up by reviewing earnings guidance on Slide 7. Full-year 2020 EPS guidance range is $8.00 to $8.25, or 10% to 13% growth rate when excluding an assumed 1% currency headwind. The key drivers to this range can be found in the bottom left section of the slide. Incremental productivity initiatives are anticipated to have the greatest impact on EPS growth as we continue to see opportunities to optimize the base business. Pricing actions net of cost inflation will also deliver incremental earnings. Furthermore, share repurchases and project backlog round up the positive factors. Recall that project backlog represents incremental sales and earnings growth, underpinned by long-term customer contracts with a fixed payment structure. Note that these top four EPS growth drivers are from either management actions or deployed capital, and thus are independent of macroeconomic or geopolitical effects. The final factor, a base volume and FX would be impacted by the macroeconomic climate, and thus leads to the most of the variability. Industrial production and the U.S. dollar average spot rate are the primary indicators. As you can see, the current guidance range assumes no help from the economy. In fact, it is currently estimated to be a headwind. Of course, this is just an assumption at this stage. If the economy is better, we will capture that value. But we believe this assumption is prudent in light of recent economic trends. For the first quarter, we are estimating EPS in the range of $1.86 to $1.94, or an increase of 11% to 16% excluding 1% currency headwind. This range assumes normal seasonality, in addition to headwinds in our Chinese merchant and package volumes due to the coronavirus outbreak. While it’s still too early to assess the overall effect of the virus, this range incorporates the most recent estimate of our customers' impact. In summary, 2019 marked a successful inaugural year, despite only having 10 months since the effective merger date. 80,000 employees worldwide came together as one and worked tirelessly to deliver on our commitments and integrate two great companies into one. Looking ahead, we’re excited about additional opportunities to create further value through business optimization, technology sharing and portfolio enhancements. And while the economic outlook maybe unclear, we have confidence in our ability to continue growing earnings per share double-digit percent. I’d now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes, good morning. First question just wanted to touch on some of the carbon footprint stuff that you highlighted, which is admirable. But one way to think about is, you think between now and 2020, you’ll probably spend north of $40 billion in total capital and the capital number you put in there was $1 billion, a little bit more than $1 billion. Can you kind of rectify those numbers? That’s a relatively small percent. Does that signify that you don’t think there is real capital investment in some of these new green technologies or that you’re going to what others? So can you just talk about what that does to your footprint as you move to this lower carbon aspiration?
Steve Angel: Yes, the $40 billion, you’re just taking $4 billion and extrapolating it over 10 years. That’d be $40 billion. Half of that would be large projects. So just about everything we would be talking about in that $1 billion kind of number would be large projects. I do think that there is a very good chance that the number is going to be larger than that based on the projects that I’m looking at today. They’re all in various stages, some of them are very early stages, but some of the size of the projects are quite significant. So I think that’s a good number to start with and we’ll continue to reevaluate that over time.
Duffy Fischer: Great. And then would you expect the returns on that $1 billion, or if the numbers larger than $1 billion to be in the same range as what the historic Linde-Praxair was? Or would they get a different discount rate applied to them?
Steve Angel: No, I expect them to be the same returns. So, just...
Duffy Fischer: Great, thank you, guys.
Steve Angel: Just got to be clear about that. But if you look at IRR, we always are looking to earn a good spread above our cost of capital, risk-adjusted.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nicola Tang with Exane. Your line is now open.
Nicola Tang: Thanks, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one was on the outlook and the sort of headwinds you’re flagging on the base volume and FX side. I was wondering, on the base volume side, could you be more specific in terms of the outlook by either geography or by specific end markets? I think in your comments, you mentioned the Q1 headwinds in China, but perhaps you could expand across the regions. And then the second question was also actually on the sustainability targets. You mentioned the 35% reduction in greenhouse gases in the next 10 years. Could you give us the sort of reference point for your CO2 equivalent emissions per dollar of EBITDA today? Thank you.
Steve Angel: So as far as the volume assumptions, what we’re looking at is, we conduct real production, particularly in Europe. And I think all of you – many people here are aware of what the December numbers were in Germany. IP was down – I think it’s 3% sequentially, at about 7% year-over-year. So declining industrial production certainly in Europe. In the U.S., industrial production is quite weak today. And then if I look at the rest of the world, I think clearly the start for China is not a positive due to some very unfortunate reasons for them. So I think just based on what we see in the world today, that’s kind of our view. Now I can throw South Pacific in that too. Australia is not doing particularly well. So no matter where you look around the world, it’s a slow IP growth world. If it does better, we’ll certainly be able to capitalize on that and it will be reflected in our top line or bottom line numbers. With respect to the greenhouse gas – was your question, what is our footprint today? Was that your question?
Nicola Tang: Yes, it was. What’s the sort of base reference point on CO2 emission by EBITDA today?
Steve Angel: Well, we published that in our sustainability – yes, thank you. We published that in our sustainability report. The number is about 40 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent annually, and a big percent of that is what we call Scope two emissions, which basically means if you buy electricity and some of that electricity is produced by carbons, that’s just what’s available on the grid, then as an electrical consumer, you are penalized so to speak with that CO2 emission. So that’s why the number ends up being something of that magnitude.
Nicola Tang: Okay. But it also includes scope 3. Is that correct?
Steve Angel: No. Scope 1 and scope two is what’s in that number.
Nicola Tang: It doesn’t include it. Okay, thank you.
Steve Angel: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Mike Sison: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice end of the year. Steve, you talked about sales synergy is one of the areas that could accelerate in 2020. I don’t see that in the EPS drivers, if you will, but is it part of the productivity area? Where does that show up? And maybe give us a little bit of color on what excites you in terms of the sales synergy going forward.
Steve Angel: Yes, it is not on that graph. So we did not attempt to display that. And I said, really kind of coming out of this year, meaning 2020. I was not referring to 2019. I expected to see more contributions. And what excites me is we just had our Global Leadership Conference, we spent a good part of that conference talking about growth, looking at the combination of applications we have, the strength of our product line portfolio and the work that’s being done to optimize that even further going forward. I look at decarbonization and what both parties bring to the equation in terms of being able to capitalize on some of the growth opportunities that will be there and I talked a little bit about that in my comments. And then you just kind of get into cross-selling and a lot of other areas that we can take advantage of. So it is something I’m getting more excited about as I see the potential. I do believe that I’ve said before, it’s hard to put a number on it, but I do think we’re going to start seeing it coming out this year and going forward.
Mike Sison: Right. And then a quick follow-up in terms of pricing. What are you looking for in 2020 and how much of that is just pricing from the base business, as well as maybe improving the pricing culture on the lending side as you had into 2020?
Steve Angel: Well, I think, again, if you look at that little Christmas tree chart that we put together for you, you could infer from that that we’re looking at another 2% price in 2020. And I think that’s about the right number at this point. This is something we’ll continue to work. It’s not a one-year and done thing. So I think we’re making good progress.
Mike Sison: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In your vision for 2020, do you expect volumes to grow on a consolidated basis, or no?
Matt White: Hi Jeff, this is Matt.
Jeff Zekauskas: Hi Matt.
Matt White: So right now, when you look at the range that we laid out on the project backlog, absolutely, yes. When you look at the economic inclusive of the FX, if the FX were zero, the upper-end may have negligible to slightly positive growth. And again, this is just an IP look at this stage. As Steve mentioned, there are actions to try and grow above IP even on the base merchant package with some of the technology. You may view this outlook as conservative, but this is how we’ve looked at it at this point. And that section there is what’s driving most of the range at this stage, but rest assured, if the economy performs better, we will absolutely capture that. Remember, it’s a contractual business even in the merchant and to a large extent, package. And we obviously would also be taking appropriate actions to try and mitigate any decline in various markets. But right now, the view is, is that the base would be slightly up to negative. And then the project contributions will continue to come through as expected.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay. In terms of your I guess cost reduction and cash flows, it looks like your cash outflows for restructuring will drop – I don’t know, $400 million next year, something like that. So should your cash flows benefit by that? In other words, whatever you generated this year in operating cash flow, should be another $400 million or $500 million because of a smaller cash outflows? Plus you’re going to grow on top of it. It seems like your cost-cutting is ahead of schedule over a three-year period. Is that right? And so, could you comment on that?
Matt White: This is Matt, again, Jeff. I can answer the first part of the question. Absolutely, you’re right. You are correct. The $800 million that we had in 2019 will be much lower in 2020. I would say at least $500 million. Because to your exact point, a lot of the merger costs are behind us on a cash basis. They’re going to be some small ones on some of the final divestitures that occurred here in the back half of the year. You just have some late either income taxes or payments of invoices. And so that part will have some effect in the first half, but then from here on out, it’ll be mostly restructuring. And I think as it’s been discussed in prior calls, Asia was probably the first out of the gate and corporate Americas. We are in the midst of some in Europe. So I think you will still see some of that effect going through, definitely through 2020, and possibly depending upon the economies, could extend into 2021. That will be – to be determined. But at this stage, from a cash perspective, absolutely it would be a decline from 2019 to 2020.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Clark with Societe Generale. Your line is now open.
Peter Clark: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. We had two questions on EMEA, if I can. Obviously, a healthy sequential price again. I’m just wondering, particularly in terms of the cylinders, how things are going, because clearly the added value you can help through pushing on the cylinders side, is probably pretty impressive I think when you look at the Linde portfolio that came in. And then the second one on the synergies, you alluded to this, I think that’s obviously Asia first out of the gate. A lot of synergies last year. It’s probably the biggest kicker regionally. Would I be right in thinking maybe Europe proportionately produces moats on the synergy front in 2020? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yes, 3% price year-over-year. I know the price sequentially. And as you’ve heard me say this before, it’s always good to be seeing price on a trending basis. 50% of this business is packaged gases. So you don’t move prices that well unless you’re doing a good job on a transaction basis in a lot of – with a lot of customers. Yes. The Eastern European business that was – the old Linde AG business is now part of Linde plc, is a great franchise. I think you appropriately pointed that out. With respect to productivity, Matt started talking about it. Yes, Asia was out of the gates quickly. Corporate moved pretty well. Americas moved pretty quickly. And EMEA is a little bit slower in terms of addressing some of the personnel adjustments that are part of the merger. And we knew that coming into this, we need to work through the European Works Councils, work through the local works councils, and that’s something that we’ve been doing on a very constructive basis. But there will be more to come as a result of the negotiations that have taken place, to date.
Peter Clark: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Steve, just on your balance sheet, you entered the year still under-levered. What’s your thinking or Matt’s thinking on perhaps levering up the balance sheet a little bit more to – maybe buyback a little bit more stock? Thank you.
Steve Angel: I’m going to let Matt answer that.
Matt White: So David, you’re exactly right. We are looking for a target rating of Aa2 and our current balance sheet has significant room to go to reach there, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we ended the year at a net debt figure it of around $11 billion. Clearly, we’re going to raise that. My view is probably $2 billion is kind of a round number that I think we would – at a minimum, look to raise it, possibly more, depends on conditions – a lot of different conditions. But I think when you look at – like I mentioned, in 2019, we were able to distribute and utilize almost $12 billion of capital. So I think we had a good start. And we were able to – proceeds were higher than anticipated, cash was higher than anticipated, those are good problems to have. So, we probably got a little bit behind on deploying the capital, but that’s just gives us more ample dry powder and opportunity as we look forward. So nobody knows what will happen in the markets, but we will continue to have a very strong balance sheet that we can leverage and utilize, and that’s something we’ll continue to do.
David Begleiter: Perfect. And Steve and Matt, just on the merger cost synergies. I know they’re kind of embedded in productivity, but can you talk about what are the incremental merger cost synergies in 2020 versus 2019?
Steve Angel: I don’t – David, I don’t really try to separate those out anymore in terms of buckets. I’m just looking at operating margins, larger productivity buckets. I don’t try to distinguish as to whether it came out of a merger bucket or it came out of the productivity bucket. So to me, the cost – the cost saving is a cost saving and that really is the way we’re looking at it. And the way you and everybody else will know that we’re accomplishing what we hope to do coming in this merger is if operating margins continue to expand, and they are. If you – if I just do the math, with the fourth quarter gas margins, excluding engineering, were 20%. So we’re starting to make some good progress. I think that’s going to continue. Matt has been talking about cash flow this morning as well. And that’s obviously a very good sign that the merger is working and that the costs are coming out and the cash flow is flowing.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Laurence Alexander: Good morning. Could you touch on two things? One, I guess can you directly address the investor concern about Linde’s ability to pass through carbon prices to the extent that they’re enacted in different parts of the world? And secondly, as you think about the impact of a softer end market environment, is this showing or accelerating any process to rationalize the broader Linde footprint?
Steve Angel: As far as the footprint itself, we have spent a lot of time looking at the footprint. We look at all the countries that we are in, as a result of the combination. We look at some of the businesses that we both have been in, that we brought to the merger, and we have plans around all of that. Now, some of that takes time, usually it takes longer than I’d like, but we have a process. We’re working through it diligently, we know what we want to do. I’m not really familiar with the point on not being able to pass through higher carbon prices. That is something that we have contractually around the world. And if we’ve been aware that this was something that could happen, I’d say going back five or six years, we started making sure that our contracts had provisions that if there is any environmental legislation of any type that might cause some type of carbon tax as a result of electricity consumption or making hydrogen and CO2 as a byproduct, or what have you, that we would be able to pass that through and customers accept those terms.
Laurence Alexander: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes Bob Koort from with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Bob Koort: Thank you very much. Just wondering if you could talk, Steve, on Slide 7, the Christmas tree you called it, the drivers of growth in 2020. How do those look different than what happened in 2019 when you had the slightly higher earnings growth, or the variances year-on-year there in terms of contribution?
Matt White: Hey Bob, it’s Matt. I could probably answer that. I think when you look at the price/cost inflation productivity, those – you can look at either way, do you put price net of inflation, or do you put productivity net of inflation. But I would say, the combination of those two were contributors of the largest amount, if you want to call it the management self-help. I think from a backlog perspective, we are expecting more in 2020 than in 2019, due to the start up range. Share repurchases. Obviously, we repurchased on a net basis $2.6 billion in 2019. $2.6 billion. Looking forward, we have ample capacity to do that or more. The base volume FX. FX was quite severe at minus 4%, but the base volumes as you saw was actually positive 2%. So that would’ve created a negative 2%. We are anticipating a worse outlook in 2020 than that. So if 2019’s macroeconomic was a repeat in 2020, obviously that would be a positive for us all around on this assumption. But at this stage – again, this is an assumption. We’re not projecting that we know the future. We just have an assumption or trying to lay out the basic guidelines, and we’ll manage the business accordingly.
Bob Koort: Got it. And Steve, I think you made the comment about, looking at your project execution on a risk-adjusted basis, your backlog obviously is much more tilted to Asia than your current portfolio. Can you talk about how you look at project return hurdles in Asia relative maybe to the core business that’s generating those 12% returns today?
Steve Angel: We look at it the same way. It’s it starting off with, what is your cost of capital with the expected return, adjusting for risks. And when I say risk, I’ll give you an example of a very large project with Samsung that we’re starting to start up as we speak. Longstanding customer. I think we all know who Samsung is. We’ve had a great relationship with them over years. We have an incumbent position in several of their locations. They pay in about 25 days. So when I go through the normal assessment of risk, they come out very well as a low risk. And it’s an excellent return. So I don’t really look at projects in Asia any differently than I would look at them in other parts of the world, but it’s always important to go through that risk profile to make sure that what you think is a return that you should get, you will actually get it.
Bob Koort: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Haire with UBS Securities. Your line is now open.
Geoff Haire: Good morning. Just wanted to ask two quick questions. First of all, on the green hydrogen comment you made at the very start of the call, you’ve got a number of electrolyzer units at the moment. I was wondering if you just tell us what the average size of that is. And with the ITM Power investment where you think that could go in the future? And also, could you just give us a quick update on how things are in China from Linde’s point of view, just in relation to the coronavirus? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Okay. All right. So we have about 80 electrolyzers under operation, about 40 megawatts. So you can do the math there a lot of them are quite small. Typical module size today out of ITM is about 2 megawatts. There are plans to grow that in terms of making larger-scale modules, which then can be stacked and you can build out the remaining plant equipment and systems around that. I think the number – it’s hard for me to put a number on what it can be, but I think we’re looking at a much larger projects going forward, particularly with some of the industrial customers we’re talking to, they have an interest – sincere interest in moving to green hydrogen. And the connected load, the megawatt load would be quite high based on some of the things I’m looking at. So it’s going to grow a lot. Now, so what are some of the hurdles? Today, the cost of electrolysis or producing hydrogen through electrolysis is probably four times what it would be based on producing hydrogen from more conventional means like natural gas based steam-methane reforming. So there is some work that needs to be done to bring the cost down, scaling up is part of it, more efficient modules is part of it. Lower cost, renewable power is part of that, so we are very much cognizant of that, and those are things that we’re working on. So that will help drive, this marketplace, the ability to bring those costs down. Of course, if government steps in and provides some of that difference, that would help it move more quickly. To China and coronavirus, we have about 2,600 people in China in Wuhan region. We have – about 1% of our people are in Wuhan. We have very small operations there today. So with respect to Wuhan, we’re not dramatically affected. No – fortunately, as of today, no one of our 2,600 employees nor any of our employees around the world have a confirmed – have been confirmed with coronavirus. So we’re very pleased to hear that. We provided aid as a corporation to our Chinese team and much of that is flowing to Wuhan. We prioritized the flow of key products that are needed to fight this virus like oxygen, medical gases. And obviously, we’ve been watching the situation very closely from a business standpoint. On-site customers have not really shown much of an effect, not yet. The merchant liquid – to give you an example, in a typical year, during Lunar New Year, merchant liquid capacity would probably drop to about 30%, rather than seeing one week of that this year, we saw two weeks and they’re slowly coming back from that. And as Matt explained early on, we’ve accounted for that – certainly based on what we know about the virus, we’ve accounted for that in our guidance. So that’s the situation. Tough situation for the people there, but they’re working through it.
Geoff Haire: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on backlog dynamics. Steve, you’ve talked about the slowing macroeconomic activity. And I think in the past, we’ve talked about maybe a deceleration in sort of the urgency around project signings. I’m just curious, are you seeing anything changing in terms of the opportunity set that’s out there, or the counter-party’s desire to move forward?
Steve Angel: I would still characterize it as, not a lot of hurry. People are not in a lot of hurry to get projects closed. Their proposal rate on large projects is low. Most of what we’re looking at is in this smaller range, it’s $50 million, maybe up to $100 million, maybe a little bigger than that, but nothing over $250 million. I think that’s just reflective of kind of where we are as an economy. But if I were to kind of try to look downstream in terms of what I think could happen with respect to the backlog, I believe that the U.S. Gulf Coast is still advantaged with low cost natural gas that’s still going to continue to attract especially, chemical customers. I think we could see some growth – more growth with hydrogen in places like the U.S. Gulf Coast, but not restricted to that. As a result of IMO 2020, some of the decarbonization projects that we’re working on, again, some of them are fairly large, but it’ll be interesting to see how quickly they evolve and develop, but that could be additive to the backlog and then I think you have to look at electronics though it’s been in a low this past – during the second half of 2019 and especially in the fourth quarter. I think the long-term trends are very positive. So there is lower nanometer geometry, artificial intelligence, 5G, this EUV technology that Samsung and others have been adopting. And I think that will drive stronger electronics demand going forward, and it could result in increased adding products to the backlog.
Vincent Andrews: Okay. And just to follow up on the CapEx for 2020. If my math’s correct, it’s down versus 2019. And I know part of the reduction is probably the synergies – the CapEx synergies that you’ve guided to. But maybe you could just bridge the 2019 and 2020 CapEx for us in terms of what the differential is?
Matt White: Yes. Vincent. It’s Matt. You’re absolutely right. If you break it down between the project and between the base, the base CapEx we absolutely are expecting probably $100 million, $200 million kind of synergies that we would anticipate to see on a year-over-year basis. And realize as I stated, in that base, there are small growth projects, like the 30 VPSAs that we had recently announced. So when we can get those, we’ll take those all day long. So they can cause some quarterly number movement. But in the end of the day, we definitely anticipate some synergies in that line. As far as the project, frankly the bigger that number is, the happier I am, because that means we’re ahead on our project schedule. So that one is pretty much just lockstep with our engineering project outlooks in terms of timing and construction. But those are, as you can imagine, very tightly managed on a project basis from our engineering team. And that’s something that we’ll just continue to build to our schedules.
Vincent Andrews: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical. Your line is now open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. A couple of questions, sticking with the project backlog. Steve, in your prepared remarks, I think you made a comment that you won practically every project that you chose to pursue. And so if activity remains sufficient, does that suggest that you may have upside to push the envelope and increase returns above the current rate of 11.6%? And then my second question is more specific on your engineering backlog. Looks like that increased $800 million or so sequentially. On Slide 14, you referenced the Amur project. Just wonder if you could comment on that project specifically and what impact you would expect that to have on the helium market and whether you can pull some more helium off of that yourselves? Thank you very much.
Steve Angel: Yes. So all the projects that we’re starting up are going to be accretive to return on capital. So it’s 11.6%, I believe that’s the number that you’re looking at. And of course, I’m looking at internal rate of return when I look at these projects, unlevered after-tax internal rate of return, above the cost of capital. But after a few years, these projects are typically already accretive to ROC, and then over time, they are definitely accretive to ROC. So I would say that – we look at just about every project. In fact, I always encourage my teams to bring all the projects forward, and we’ll take a look at and we’ll decide whether or not we think they’re worth participating. But the criteria we use is pretty straightforward. It has to fit our strategy as a company, and it has to have a good return above cost of capital as I described earlier. And we’re going to maintain that twin criteria, but we do want to look at practically everything that’s out there. With respect to the Linde Engineering, yes, the backlog numbers are up for sure. The Amur project is not related to helium, the Amur project is mixed-feed cracker for SIBUR. And so that’s not related to what you’re thinking about. But there are natural gas plants for Gazprom that are being built and starting up that will be – we’ll have helium online, I would say the second half of next year is when you would start to see the impact from that.
Kevin McCarthy: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
John McNulty: Yes, thanks for taking my question. With regard to the base CapEx, what portion of that is actually tied to revenue generating projects versus kind of the more normal maintenance or efficiency type projects?
Matt White: Hey John, this is Matt. That’s not a number we disclose. But I can tell you it’s a meaningful part of that number, and it’s something we evaluate. But as you can imagine, when you get into things like transportation, cylinder, storage, equipment, tanks, it gets a very fine line what is growth, what is replacement. So this is something internally we spend a lot of time on. But it’s just not a number externally that we disclose. But I can tell you on like VPSAs and those type plants that we have announced, they are under $5 million of spend, but there are in the upper end. So they’re $4 million to $5 million. Sometimes, they could be a little lower. So those would be included in this number as well.
John McNulty: Got it. And I guess when you think about the returns on those projects versus kind of the more base – or the more kind of big project pipeline, how do the returns compare?
Steve Angel: Well, they’re very solid. The configuration of a typical small on-site project is, it’s 100% facility fee. So and they’re easy to construct, so I’ve always liked these small on-site projects. I’m excited about the capability that we now have between the two companies. We have every offering covered now in small on-site, and it’s something that we’re very much focused on as a company. Very strong, 100% kind of take-or-pay commercial contracts. They are easier to construct, much simpler configuration. So all you have to do really is select the right customer.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Martin Roediger with Kepler. Your line is now open.
Martin Roediger: Hello, Steve, Matt, Juan. Actually, two minor questions only. Some of your competitors do portfolio freeing, it means disposing non-core activities. Is that a topic also which is on your agenda? I refer Horizon, the logistics company. Just – that’s my first question.
Steve Angel: Martin, I prefer not to get into specifics about which companies that we are looking at divesting. And you will – just all I’m going to say is really, we’re pretty active as we look at businesses and geographies that we don’t think belong in our portfolio long term, from a strategic standpoint. And you’ll hear more about that as the year progresses.
Martin Roediger: And the second question is on the sustainability topics. Can you help us to understand how much short you are in terms of certificates when it comes to the European Trading Scheme? And do you think your actions to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity will help you to be better prepared for the Phase 4 in the European Trading Scheme, i.e., that you are not short anymore in emission certificates?
Steve Angel: Well, I don’t know exactly how the trading scheme is going to work at this point. I believe that these are management targets. So we decided as a team, these are things that we wanted to go after. As I said earlier, renewable power has a lot to do – the availability of renewable power has a lot to do with what our emissions profile ultimately looks like. And the sooner the world converts to renewable, the best better off we will be. We’re going to be very active in terms of going out and contracting for renewable power. And that’s how you are able to increased purchases from $1 billion to $2 billion. But as far as reaching carbon neutrality at some point in the future, there are other things that would need to happen. Beyond 100% renewable power, we will need I think a very strong carbon tax around the world. We need advancements in technology, all things that can be achieved, but they just take a longer time frame.
Martin Roediger: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. Steve, you noted some slowing in electronics markets in Asia. I think that a number of players in the semiconductor space are encouraged that we’re starting to see a recovery. So can you just talk about what you were seeing kind of in the second half, and particularly in Q4? And maybe comment on your outlook for 2020 in electronics?
Steve Angel: Yes. So, as there are big inventory builds in memory chips, prices dropped precipitously, Samsung did not have best quarter they’ve ever had. They announced here recently. So that is what’s – that’s really been in the news I think the last several quarters in 2019. Most people think that it will be better, that this bottom, that it’s going to improve in 2020 and it’s going to improve based on a lot of the trends that I mentioned earlier. So I don’t have a number for you, but I think it should be better in 2020, and certainly when we start up some of these big projects that will be quite additive.
Mike Harrison: And then wanted to also ask you about the Americas, you commented that manufacturing in metals and markets were weaker. Talk about what you’re seeing in hard goods versus packaged gases? And also maybe comment on the new trade agreements that are in place. Any sense that those could have some positive impact on manufacturing in metals in the U.S. during 2020?
Steve Angel: Yes. So, hard goods year-over-year is down double digits. Gas is flat, hard goods sequentially, Q3 to Q4, is down high-single digits, whereas gas is flat. So clearly hard goods is feeling the effect, gas is not nearly so much so. Looking forward into the year with respect to trade agreements, I think to the extent that we supply large capital equipment, export companies that will have some positive effect, I quite frankly don’t think it’s going to be a huge number, but it could have some positive effects.
Matt White: And just, Mike, this is Matt. As a reminder, we have a very strong Canadian and Mexican franchise as well. So I think regardless of which side of the border and where that goes, we feel quite confident in our ability to capture the business.
Mike Harrison: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-12 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Linde Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded [Operator instructions]. I would now like the hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Juan Pelaez, please go ahead.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, Michelle. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. Once again, this is Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our Web site at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides, and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the pro forma numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Steve and Matt will now give us an update on Linde. We will then be available to answer questions. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Angel: Thank you, Juan. The team delivered very strong results for the quarter. We saw operating profit and operating profit margins improve, both sequentially and year-over-year in every segment. EPS improved substantially year-over-year and sequentially. Cash flow came through nicely as we have expected. Project CapEx grew while base CapEx shrank, which reflects spend against our large project backlog and CapEx efficiencies. ROC percent, the single most important metric in a capital intensive business, continue to improve. The cell gas backlog remains strong at $5 billion, which gives us a nice foundation for future growth. We raised our guidance again, which reflects our positive momentum, the opportunities we see to continue to improve the quality of our business and the resiliency of our business model. And of course, this is against a backdrop of softening worldwide demand. A few comments on the segments. In the Americas, which represents nearly 40% of our total sales and nearly half of our overall operating profit, we saw good organic sales year-over-year, driven by price but flat sales sequentially. Strength in food and beverage and healthcare is offsetting weakness and metals and manufacturing. Operating margins continue to improve as we drive efficiencies across the region. In Europe, we saw evidence of better execution as operating margins reached 20.5% despite a weaker macro. The weakness we saw in the quarter continued through September and October. In APAC, operating margins are climbing nicely, up 450 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially, as the team continues to do an excellent job delivering on merger efficiencies. Volumes are impacted by slowing China, Australia and turn around to South East Asia. In Linde engineering we saw record margins, driven by excellent execution, cost absorption and timing as we're able to close our key projects during the quarter. Though backlogs remain strong, I don't see this level of operating margin as sustainable. This is a business that should trend closer to low double digit percents through the cycle. The global other segment reflects ongoing merger efficiencies as you would expect. Our focus, successful integration, improve the quality at each and every business, optimize our portfolio around core sale of gas regions and businesses and then drive network density, facilitate growth synergies and drive operational excellence and everything we do. Final comment before I turn it over to Matt. We have a resilient business model, which generate strong cash flow through the economic cycle. In periods of expansion, we invest for growth. And when the macro weakens, we return that cash to shareholders. You add to that the value created by a merger and you can see why we are an investment for all seasons, and why I wouldn't trade places with anyone. Matt?
Matt White: Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. Third-quarter adjusted pro forma results are shown on Slide 3. Consistent with prior quarters, these figures have been adjusted to best demonstrate underlying trends and performance of the combined business. You'll find the required reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the appendix. Sales of $7 billion are 1% higher than prior year, but 3% below the second quarter of this year. Foreign currency translation continues to be a headwind as the U.S. dollar strengthened across the board. Excluding FX and cost pass through, underlying sales increased 4% from 2018 but decreased 1% sequentially. Versus prior year, prices rose 2% and the 2% volume increase was split between organic growth and project contribution. While the more resilient end markets of food, beverage and healthcare continue to grow, we are seeing declining to negative growth rates across most industrial markets, especially metals and manufacturing. The slowing industrial activity is primarily driven by North America, China and Australia, which is consistent with our expectations. Versus the second quarter of this year, price increased 1% from broad-based actions but volume declined 2% from engineering project timing and some seasonality and weaker industrial activity in EMEA. Despite the softening economic conditions, operating profit grew 16% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, or 19% and 6% when excluding currency translation, the combination of price attainment and cost efficiencies across all segments, enabling operating margins to expand 270 basis points versus 2018 and 140 basis points versus Q2. The company reached 19.8% operating margin this quarter as employees around the world continue to coordinate efforts to improve productivity and operational excellence. Net income increased 24% from prior year or 27% when excluding FX translation. The reason for greater profit leverage is due to lower net interest expense from a combination of excess cash flow and FX impact. As stated before, we are recapitalizing the balance sheet to better align with our target single A credit rating, but this will take a little more time as we refine our cash forecasting. Until then, we are actively deploying excess cash and managing the capital structure to deliver value to the shareholders. EPS of $1.94 was 26% higher than prior year and 6% higher sequentially. Excluding FX, those figures improved to 29% and 7% respectively. This result is somewhat higher than anticipated, since favorable impact from cost management actions more than offset worse than expected FX rates. In addition to delivering strong profit leverage this quarter, a large majority of earnings pulled through to cash, as operating cash flow increased 86% sequentially to $1.9 billion. While we would normally expect some seasonal improvement, most of the sequential increase is driven by better working capital management, along with higher EBITDA and less merger related outflows. CapEx increased 11% from Q2. But you can see that was driven by project CapEx, which represents customer projects under construction and secured by long term contracts that lead to incremental growth. The sale of gas backlog associated with project CapEx remains strong at $4.7 billion, and will be executed over the next three years. Although, that spend pattern will be somewhat lumpy. Base CapEx, which represents all other capital spend not associated with our project backlog, such as small growth, cost reduction and maintenance, declined 7% sequentially as we continue to find more opportunities for cash synergies. Rolling this all together results in a return on capital of 11.2% or a 60 basis point sequential increase, this improvement is driven by higher after tax profit over a capital base that declined due to prudent cash management across the organization. We firmly believe that return on capital is one of the most important metrics for this industry in light of the capital intensity and long term contractual structure. Given this cash and capital trends I felt it may be helpful to provide a little more detail, which you can find on Slide 4. The left side shows operating cash flow trends by quarter. The first two quarters were each around $1 billion, but subsequently increased to almost $1.9 billion in the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the key drivers include declining merger related outflows, higher earnings and better working capital performance. In addition, the first half tends to be seasonally lower from timing of cash incentives and taxes. The year-to-date figure of $3.9 billion includes $0.7 billion of one-time merger related outflows. This $0.7 billion primarily relates to taxes and fees, which supported $11 billion of divestiture proceeds, in addition to legal and advisor payments. These merger outflows will be significantly lower in 2020. The pie chart in the lower right represents how the year-to-date operating cash flow has been allocated. Overall, it's a balanced approach with roughly half invested in the business and half return to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Of the half invested in the business, it's evenly split between investments in secured growth and base CapEx. Secured growth represents accretive acquisitions and project CapEx for the backlog. Base CapEx is important to support non-backlog growth, achieve cost reduction targets and maintain high levels of plant safety, reliability and efficiency. Overall, the priority is to invest in high quality projects, the growth projects that meet our investment criteria, while continuously generating excess free cash flow to distribute back to shareholders. Please turn to Slide 5 for an update on full year guidance. We are raising full years EPS guidance to $7.25 to $7.30, which represents an increase of 17% to 18% from prior year, or 21% to 22% when excluding 4% currency headwind. The guidance is above last quarter due to favorable Q3 results and continued confidence and opportunities to improve the cost structure. However, this range also implies that Q4 EPS will be below the $1.94 from Q3. Part of this sequential decline relates to the timing of project completions for the engineering business. Engineering is a long cycle business with projects that take several years. So the quarter-to-quarter results can vary but we fully expect to maintain high levels of execution. Another driver of the anticipated Q3 to Q4 decline relates to projections of a weaker macro. Lower manufacturing levels and longer customer outages continue to point to decreasing industrial activity. In summary, despite the macroeconomic headwinds we continue to improve the quality of the business and grow earnings double digit percent over last year. This is only possible from the collective efforts of all 80,000 employees executing as one team. And while geopolitical forces will likely result in more uncertainty for 2020 and beyond, we maintain a high degree of confidence in our ability to leverage opportunities that not only overcome these challenges, but will also create substantial value for our owners. I'd now like to turn the call over for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Mike Sison: Steve, you know when you think about the macro environment being weak as it is and your earnings growth pretty strong. How do you frame up the leverage potential if demand gets better, particularly you know longer term given you're doing 17% to 18% growth. How much better can your earnings grow get with the better economic environment?
Steve Angel: Well, I think clearly there's leverage to the EPS if volumes improve above what we're looking at. Going forward into next year, we certainly have a backlog that we've talked about in the past that will be additive to our EPS. We have pricing expectations as well. We have ongoing cost efficiencies. We have the impact of share buybacks, et cetera. So anything that happens on the volume line would be additive to that. But I think we have to be realistic based on the trends we're seeing, which are not particularly positive around the world. So that's why we frame -- but why I frame my view of going forward, because I'm looking at the trends that just aren't that positive.
Mike Sison: And then just curious on your engineering backlog of $5 billion. How does that overtime translate to earnings growth in a given year or given couple of years?
Steve Angel: Well, its third party sales. And so if you kind of assume certain level of sales that we're seeing now on a quarterly basis and if you assume operating margins again something closer to what as I said in my opening comments, which are kind of low double digits, call it like 11%, 12% maybe 13% kind of range through the cycle, that's what we should be able to expect. And the strong backlog just gives us confidence that going forward into next year we're going to have that to work against and certainly into part of the following year. It will come a point where we're going to need to add new projects to sustain that level of profitability going forward.
Matt White: And I think Mike -- this is Matt, one thing to add, just as a reminder. I mean, this is primarily a negative working capital business. It's highly accretive. It's not capital intensive like the remainder of the natural gas business. So it is highly complementary from a financial perspective in addition.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Markus Mayer with Baader Helvea. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Markus Mayer: Good morning gentlemen. Markus Mayer, Baader Helvea. Three questions from my side, first one is on the guidance. Maybe you can help us understand what -- when you look at the guidance raised what was trigger by the share buyback effect, what was the negative effects from ForEx, and what affect came from the different organic growth assumption or the different efficiency effects? That would be my first question.
Matt White: Markus, this is Matt. I can handle that. I think from a share buyback perspective, I'd say little to no effect. That's not really having any effect. In fact, I would say we were probably a little bit behind on our programs on the last quarter. So that's really not having much of an effect. But the offset to that would be slightly better interest. So I would think about interest and buyback really as kind of offsetting each other. As I have favorable interest, I'll be behind the buyback program. But as I work towards a single A, then I'll probably have a lower share count. FX definitely had a negative effect. When we looked and gave guidance a quarter ago, I would say the FX got worse by 1% to almost 2% then what we had anticipated. We'll have to see what it means going forward, but that is something that got a little worse as the dollar strengthened pretty much across the board. As far as the growth, I think the easier way to probably think about it is sequentially, as we mentioned, thinking about Q3 to Q4. At this stage, this guidance implies probably about a percent kind of erosion on base volumes. We'll have to see if that occurs or not. Obviously, anything better than that should be upside, but right now that's our assumption and we'll see what ultimately comes out.
Markus Mayer: The second question would be what was the helium effect on your price increase in this quarter?
Matt White: The helium, if you look at year-over-year, it was probably about a quarter of the price effect, the 2% maybe slightly higher but something around that vicinity and sequentially, no effect.
Markus Mayer: And then last question would be. How much of this very strong cash flow generation came from the engineering pre-payments as they recently signed several projects?
Steve Angel: So I think the best way to look at that is when you look at our statement of cash flows. You'll see a line called contract assets and liabilities net. That essentially represents customer deposits and what the changes of that. So for this quarter, we did have a favorable amount of $68 million. But that's a number that goes up and down. Prior quarter, it was negative just due to lapping from prior years. So I think that's the number we gave out for you to be able to track independently.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.
Jeff Zekauskas: If we look at the pro forma cost of goods sold. Year-over-year, it's down about $125 million. So if you annualize that, that's about $500 million. And if you look at your SG&A year-over-year, it's down about a little bit more than $30 million. So if you annualize that, that's $125 million. So is it the case that order of magnitude your run rate cost reductions are, I don't know, $625 million something like that? Is that a fair characterization?
Matt White: Jeff, this is Matt. I think the challenge on looking solely at pro forma and not pro forma adjusted, is that, all of the effects of purchase accounting are going to be in those results. And as you can imagine, we had to step up the inventory as part of purchase accounting, which will have a disproportionate effect on COGS in the beginning, and then that would rapidly decline. So there are lots of different lives of assets that had to be stepped up, that are anywhere from months to infinite life. So pro forma, as you know, under Article 11 SEC, still has all purchase price accounting effects in it. So that's why we think looking solely at pro forma is going to be a bit tricky, because of the purchase price accounting effects, and what I still firmly believe is the numbers that we represented here on a pro forma adjusted best represent, and as we stated in the last call, we fully believe we're on full track now. Obviously, as you can see in the results, we did do a little better than expected on costing. I think timing was a little more favorable than we anticipated. But we are fully in line with the $900 million target that was given and the promise that was given, at the $300 million per year. So we feel quite confident on that and from here on out, everything we're looking for -- just overall efficiencies and opportunities as one operating company.
Jeff Zekauskas: And then your APAC sales didn't really grow very fast. And you know, it turns out that your -- some of your competitors are growing pretty quickly in China, and they're growing pretty quickly in the Mideast. Is that something you feel that you need to do anything about? Do you feel like you're growing at the appropriate rate in those two regions?
Steve Angel: So when you look at APAC, I think we kind of said at the outset that you have -- we have the Australia position that we are addressing, China, certainly slowing growth, some turnarounds during the quarter that had some effect. But Jeff, when you look at where we are today, there is very little contribution from large projects in those numbers, and it so happens, if you go look at the sale of gas backlog, Asia represents nearly $3 billion of that backlog. So we have some very large projects and some large contributions ahead. And I think if you look at the industry, whenever one of us reports, if there is a big number, usually it has something to do with the large project or projects. And as the case is today, we just don't have that contribution, it's just a question of timing. Again, the backlog is ahead of us. If I look at the long-term trends, the place like Asia-Pacific, clearly, electronics is going to be strong going forward. I have already talked about the backlog. I think as these emerging markets develop the applications that both legacy companies have brought to the combined company, are going to have a positive effect, the pricing equation is something that we look at very carefully and continue to work. Regarding other parts of the world, we look at many things. But then again it all has to pass the screen of -- is this a strategic geography, is this a geography that we think we can build density, because our strategy is all about focusing on core geographies that we can build network density. And then as we look at individual projects, there is a risk versus return assessment that we go through a very thoroughly and it to pass that screen as well. So that's how I'd answer that question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Martin Roediger with Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Martin Roediger: Two questions, the first is on -- actually both are for Matt. The PPA related amortization charges dropped by 18% sequentially compared to Q2, while the euro has softened 5% only. The other intangible assets in your balance sheet have been sequentially stable. Can you explain that massive change in the PPA amortization charges? And secondly coming back to the operating cash flow, you mentioned high EBITDA, better working capital and less merger related outflows. But I see that you also had some disposal proceeds of $271 million. Are there any other funding items included in that cash flow figure? Thanks.
Matt White: So we'll start with the PPA. I think it's a bit of a -- consistent with what I had mentioned to Jeff. So as you can imagine in purchase price accounting, you are required to assign valuations across a whole spread of different assets that have various lives. So there are a significant portion that is assigned to shorter life inventory, and as those fall off, you have a significant amortization and then they obviously go through your cost of goods and then they're sold. So any inventory would have fallen off in the first, the second quarter and you would have a larger amount of recognition and amortization. As the years go on and you start losing more of the shorter lives, the amortization number will continue to decline. So that is a normal pattern in any type of GAAP purchase price accounted effect, that your amortization is at its peak at the beginning, and then it rapidly declines on short-lived assets, such as inventory, software things that might be three-year life, five-year life vehicles, and then over time, you get into machinery buildings that get to 10, 20 years. So this is a normal pattern of any kind of amortization. But again, back to my earlier point, this is why we wanted to focus on adjusted figures, because this amortization can create a lot of confusion, and it's really non-cash and given our scenario was a merger of equals, there really was no capital component of this merger. So that's why we really are focusing on the adjusted figures. As far as the operating cash flow, just to make sure you understand, any disposable proceed gains are part of divestitures, which relates to investing cash flow, not operating cash flow. So there would be none of those gains related. In fact, it's the opposite what happens. The gain is in your P&L. It is completely wiped out in your operating cash flow to make it a zero effect. And then the full proceeds are put in investing cash flow. That's how GAAP accounting works. Our cash flow statements are per GAAP accounting. So hopefully, that answer makes sense.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Duffy Fischer: Just wanted to go back to your Slide 4, Matt, on the cash flow bar charts. I'm trying to understand, at current levels of profitability, was your intention to kind of guide us more to what the Q3 looks like going forward that we've taken a step change up, or did that have some one-time working capital benefits that maybe, can't repeat? So maybe at the midpoint for Q4 and then going forward, what's the better bar to think about as cash flow conversion from an earnings level?
Matt White: I think from my perspective right now, probably the best way to think about is, on a year-to-date basis, we're at $3.9 billion. And within that are these $700 million of merger related costs. And as I mentioned in the transcript, that's going to drastically fall off in 2020. It will be quite small. There'll be a little bit of hangover of our final divestitures, which will be pretty minimal. And then there will just be some ongoing cash restructuring, which should be fairly small to achieve the synergies. So the way I would think about it is, if you take that $3.9 million and add back almost all of that $0.7 billion or you could say $0.6 billion, somewhere in that neighborhood. You're looking at mid 4s, is where we probably should be on a normal ongoing basis through three quarters. I do think the seasonality was a little overly skewed in this first half, partly because of the merger outflows, partly also because of the two legacy companies having independent compensation schemes that paid out at the beginning of the quarter. Going forward, we'll have one compensation scheme. So that should also help reduce some of that component. But I would still think about it. As I've mentioned in earlier calls, just to think about EBITDA, kind of an OCF as a relationship. So what is your OCF as a percent of EBITDA. And as you may recall, we said in prior calls that, you look at the five-year average of the two legacy companies, and it's high 70s and that's something we absolutely expect to continue to deliver on. And when you look at year-to-date, if you adjust for the merger outflows through three quarters, we are were a little bit ahead of that. We're probably a couple of percent ahead of that number right now. So that's how we think about it. But I still think we should be continuously on a full year basis, converting at least three quarters or more of our EBITDA into operating cash flow. And then obviously any areas where we can enhance that, the working capital management, dividends from non-consolidated affiliates or other areas above and beyond EBITDA, we're going to continue to work toward that.
Duffy Fischer: And then Steve, maybe a question for you just, Latin America, it's a smaller business for you now, but still quite large and you are bigger than most of our companies down there. Peronists back in Argentina, Lula picking a fight out of jail. Morales gone, riots in Chile. When you look at Latin America from an investment standpoint, does it feel riskier, and does it feel like we have the danger of a meaningful let down, or is most of that just headline and the underlying business is still just grinding along?
Steve Angel: See, a lot of its headline. I mean, you can't look at Latin America historically and say it's a real stable place. So we've always had to contend with that. Again, three quarters of our business still is pretty much Brazil, and if anything, Brazil is taking a turn for the better. You've read about pension reforms, and other things they're trying to do to shrink the size of the government, privatization is there's a big push on that. And we have an excellent team on the ground, and of course I've been watching their performance very closely, and they've been working at the operating margins nicely over the last couple of years, and they are very stable. So despite all the headline news, I'm looking at results that are very stable and have been trending up positively, especially with respect to operating margin quality, which has always been the objective, and I'm just pleased to see it get close to where it was.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicola Tang with Exane. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Nicola Tang: The first would be on the base Capex and you talked about that being down 7% year-on-year. I think originally you guided to $200 million of CapEx related synergies. So I was wondering if you could update us on where we're tracking on that. And then on the P&L synergies, I think you're pointing to a $75 million run rate by the end of Q4. Can you give us an update on where we are, and any early indications on 2020? Thank you.
Matt White: Well, so with respect to the base CapEx -- and you're correct, it's down 7%, Q2 to Q3. We had said $200 million, about $200 million of CapEx efficiency as a result of the merger that would be over a three year time frame. And based on what we're seeing and the plans that we have going forward, I feel confident that that number is certainly achievable. With respect to the cost synergies, certainly with the operating margin quality improving across the board, you could surmise that the synergies are taking hold. To be very honest, as I look at these numbers, I pay less attention to what's called a synergy cost savings. And I'm just looking for improving the quality of our businesses across the board, which means better operating performance, cost productivity programs, efficiency programs, all the things that improve the overall quality of the business. So that really is where I'm focused. But coming back to the basis of your question, I would say the number that we laid out there in the beginning the $900 million kind of cost synergy over three years, that number is still very realistic in my mind.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.
John McNulty: So I guess the first one would be, with the pricing having been as strong as it has been for the last few quarters. I guess, I'd be curious if you feel like you're losing any business at all at this point or if it's really just you're catching up on the pricing side to match some of the inflation and it's holding well and you're not seeing much customer migration. So I guess a little color on that would be helpful.
Steve Angel: So it's kind of, as you said, John, really pricing is very much a granular gain, meaning you don't really manage pricing at a extremely high level. You have to manage pricing at a very granular level, and that's also where you get the biggest bang for the buck in terms of improving pricing and the value you receive for your products and services. And so, we pay very close attention to that obviously, each individual business pays close attention to that. I review 20 of them every month. And so I get to hear firsthand in terms of what's going on with respect to pricing and volume broken down by channel, by product, by country, and we go through that with a fine-tooth comb. But as I sit here today, I don't feel like we're losing business that we don't want to lose, as a result of pushing price too hard. And again, that's something we track very carefully. So I'm pleased with the progress we're making. I look at pricing sequentially. I don't really look at it that much year-over-year. I pay much more attention to sequential price improvement. As long as we're moving in the right direction and managing it appropriately at a business level, at a granular level, then I'm happy.
John McNulty: And then maybe with regard to a longer-term opportunity, I guess I'd be curious your thoughts on the opportunity around CO2? I know it looks like some of your peers are at least starting to show some interest there, but curious your thoughts on the market and the opportunities there for Linde?
Steve Angel: So I assume your question refers more to the cost of carbon and what that means from an environment standpoint. But I'll just answer both pieces. First of all, we've had a big focus on building out our CO2 infrastructure. We have seen over the years, that that's a very important product to have for carbonated products, for food freezing, for other applications, and so that's the focus we've had for several years, and I can look at the growth of our CO2 products, in places like the United States and it's growing very nicely, which would be consistent with our comments about growth in food and beverage. If I think about the price of carbon, we are seeing more projects today than we have seen in the last several years, and there is a list of things that I'm looking at, and couple of them do pertain to the cost of carbon, CO2 capture, and I think those are going to be opportunities that are going to grow going forward. It really has to be a function of legislation. You've heard about this 45Q, which is IRS ruling that provides a credit for CO2, that credit grows over time. I think that's certainly a step in the right direction that's creating some interest. But if you look around the world, those are the types of things that we're seeing, and I think it's going to be an opportunity for growth going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with Societe Generale. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Peter Clark: Just two questions, first one also which is obviously, you've pointed at the synergy run rate etcetera, but in Europe, you're talking about better execution being a key part, and I see the sequential prices up there again. Just wondering if you're starting to see the benefits of some of the cost cutting to, or is that something we really expect going forward? So it's just doing things better, that is the main thing at the moment in Europe. And then the second question, I keep reading when I open up your website, still over 100 countries. I know it's a second order thing, sorting out the density in terms of the number of countries and the exposure there, but just if we should expect anything to happen on that front as we go through 2020? Thank you.
Steve Angel: So the first question, I mean, clearly, we've had a focus on improving operating margins across the board, not just EMEA, but everywhere. And again, it's a country-by-country it's a business-by-business look. It's a product-by-product look. Pricing clearly is a piece of that. We have been taking the appropriate cost actions in Europe. We will continue to do that, because quite frankly the macro environment is not that favorable today and so it's something that we need to do. And as it relates to people, this is a discussion that we have to have and want to have at a European Works Council level and also at the local works councils. And so those discussions are sort of ongoing and they will continue. But we clearly look at Europe as an opportunity to continue to expand operating margins, and that is our intention. Part of that is looking at certain businesses that really don't belong in the portfolio, and if you go back to my earlier comment about optimizing the portfolio and that gets to your second question, we have gone through that. We just concluded a bottoms-up review that we happen to review with our Board of Directors as well in October. And we have a list, I'll call it countries and also businesses that we think we need to take action on, how do we come to that conclusion. We look at the risk of being in some of these businesses and countries. We look at the quality of the business. We look at opportunities to scale it up and build density, and then that really drives our evaluation. But we do have a list that we're working on as we speak. And then there's another list that we are monitoring, evaluating, watching, and may lead to some action later on. But we are clearly -- that's clearly something that we're focused on.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Begleiter: Steve, just on the U.S. package business. Did those volumes get worse in Q3 versus Q2? I think I recall, hardgoods was negative in Q2, but not sure, gases was negative in Q2?
Steve Angel: So the gas and hardgoods both declined low single digits, Q2 to Q3. So they both declined low single digits, and they also happen to be down year-over-year low single digits. And I'll add a little more color to that, we looked at October and hardgoods is down about 6% versus September sequentially, and that's all capital equipment or driven largely by capital equipment. So the trend that we have been describing with respect to a weakening macro in the U.S., appears to be taking hold.
David Begleiter: And just on the list of countries and businesses you need to take action on, what percent of sales or EBIT, does that comprise? Assume it's pretty small, maybe sub 5% or in that range.
Steve Angel: I'd say you're correct, it's in about the 5%, maybe a little less range and there is a lot of small countries. And again some businesses are part of that as well, that make up that number.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Adam Bubes: This is Adam Bubes on for Laurence Alexander today. I was wondering how do you think about the risk of carbon capture and sequestration projects compared to traditional syngas?
Steve Angel: How do I think about the risk?
Adam Bubes: Yes.
Steve Angel: If you look at in terms of, let's start with conventional production of hydrogen through steam methane reforming, CO2 is a byproduct of that when we structure our contracts with our customers who want that hydrogen, if there is a cost of CO2 that is passed through contractually to the customer. So I don't see that particularly as a risk for us. Now having said that, we do look at means and technologies to reduce the CO2 emissions and there are technologies that exist that we will be implementing that will allow us to do that. In terms of the opportunity aspect of that, we are seeing examples where people are asking us to look at CO2 capture projects. And that provides an additional opportunity for us. So that's the opportunity side of it. With respect to syngas, clearly syngas has a certain composition of hydrogen and CO. Syngas opportunities are more driven by the chemical industry, downstream chemical products. And there are some CO2 emissions as part of that process, but there is an opportunity to bring that CO2 back into the feed, and produce more CO and emit less emission. So that is a technology that we have and something that we're looking to deploy more and more.
Adam Bubes: And then my last question, I believe the goal in engineerings is to start to shift the business toward more over the fence projects versus third party sales. So wondering, could you give us some color on progress here and how might we think about the split developing over the next several quarters?
Steve Angel: Well, I think what we have said is that, we want to do all the good third party projects that are out there. And it so happens that Linde Engineering has a very strong track record of executing very complex projects. And that is the reason why we were as successful as we were, with a project like ExxonMobil; where ExxonMobil had confidence in Linde Engineering's capabilities too to execute a project like that. So we want to do all the good third party business that's out there, and there certainly are some opportunities that are in front of us today we want to capitalize on. By the same token, we want to do all the good sale of gas projects that we can find, and we truly believe that between our product line capability, Linde Legacy's product line capability, we have a all complement of every plant, product line that we could ever want, and we want to utilize the engineering technology skills Linde Engineering brings to be more competitive, and over the fence projects -- more traditional over-the-fence projects, and also look at opportunities to kind of broaden our sale of gas footprint, as the opportunities arise. So I think probably something on the order of 50-50 is a good place to be, with respect to third party sales and sale of gas. Again it will be kind of a function of the opportunities in front of us. But everybody understands in the company that the sale of gas is the sweet spot of the industry. It's where we want to focus and we're making good progress with that objective.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Kevin McCarthy: On Slide Number 7, regarding the Americas, I think you referenced some turnarounds on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Was that significant? And how do you look at the 4Q volume opportunity overall, relative to the 3Q level? Steve, I think you commented on hardgoods a little bit. But just more broadly, what does your crystal ball say for the Americas in 4Q?
Steve Angel: Well, we saw some turnarounds in Q3 on the Gulf Coast, and some of that continued into October as well. So it just so happened. They were quite a few grouped together. They are all now pretty much out of turnaround. So they're all running and refining capacity utilization is quite high and the, 3:2:1 crack spreads are favorable. So they want to run at this point. I think generally speaking though, whenever you have weakening demand -- a weakening macro, what we tend to see are more shutdowns, and you can call them planned, unplanned, I don't really know how you want to characterize it, but we tend to see more companies start to take shutdowns and that's demand related, for sure, sometimes it's pricing related, their pricing. So I think that's just kind of something you should expect when you're at a -- really a weaker environment overall globally. And I would like to be able to say, we are in all these turnarounds in Q3 they are all back up and running. That's additive going forward, but I know there's going to be another list of turnarounds, I'll call them, unplanned shutdowns for maintenance, whatever that we're going to probably see going toward the end of this year and perhaps into Q1 as well.
Kevin McCarthy: And then I had a similar question regarding APAC on slide 8. There again you referenced turnarounds, but also a prior year sale of equipment as contributing factors to the minus 1% that you reported year-over-year for volume. Again, how do you see APAC trending in the fourth quarter?
Matt White: Kevin, this is Matt, I can maybe handle that one. So you saw in the APAC of the minus 1% volume on a year-over-year and pretty much all of that was due to either the combination of the turnaround and the prior year sale of equipment. We do have a business in India that sells equipment. So there'll be some lumpy ups and downs on that. So ex those items, volumes were relatively flat year-over-year, and as you can imagine, it's a combination of some of the factors we talked about with China, Australia, and some puts and takes with some positive contribution from our project backlog. But I think going forward, some of those turnarounds are complete, and we expect things to be better in the fourth quarter. We are pretty confident in the customers we have. They run hard. They are the low cost producers, so we feel good about that. But we just had a little blip here in the third quarter that we're through.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open, please go ahead.
Matt DeYoe: This is Matthew DeYoe on for Steve. If I look at the cadence of earnings in EMEA in 2018, you started 1Q with EBIT on a pro forma basis of $387 million, and that declined to $308 million by 3Q '18. This year, the cadence of earnings is much more consistent. Just wondering why that is and what happened last year on a pro forma basis that's not recurring this year?
Matt White: Well, I think if you look at last year, and I didn't pay a lot of attention to last year, because I didn't really get -- we didn't really integrate the company until March 1st of this year. But we had some higher power costs last year that we did not do a good job recovering in the end market. that is behind us and now we're on a much more favorable trend.
Matt DeYoe: And if I could ask about the launch of the pediatric nitrous oxide business and how that product is going, what regions being rolled out? And I think it's about a $600 million market. Just kind of wondering how much you think market share wise, you could capture there.
Matt White: Well, it is a business that we're rolling out. I'm not going to put a big dollar figure on that, certainly for 2020. I think it's something that we have interest in. Clearly we have freedom to practice, which is very important. We've passed all the regulatory approvals from the FDA, etcetera. So we're in a good position. It is a market that we're not in. So obviously, everything is upside. I'm not expecting big numbers in 2020, but we do have hope this can grow into something significant.
Juan Pelaez: We have time for one last question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
P. J. Juvekar: So Steve, you had talked about opportunities to raise prices in Linde's legacy business in Europe and Asia. And I believe that should have been on top of market pricing. So where do we stand on that, relative to your expectations, say at the beginning of this year? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Well, I think we still have some opportunities to continue to work through. I think we've made some very good progress this year. I mean, first step is to be able to calculate what your pricing is and to be able to do a variance analysis, so you separate out pricing and then you have -- and then start looking at reports and then start to take appropriate actions. So I think a lot of those building blocks have been put in place. As I look around the world, clearly, we have very strong pricing in the Americas. I'm looking at areas that were up 6%, 7%. Some areas are lower. I can look across Europe and see that package and merchant combined is up around 4% or so. So some progress has been made there. But I just look at those pure product lines. And then I look at Asia, we have a situation currently today in China, where the year-over-year comparison is unfavorable, because pricing was very high in the prior year period, and that's something that we're working on. But overall, I think we clearly have some opportunity to do more. And that would be my expectation rolling into 2020 as well
P. J. Juvekar: And you just mentioned China, and you said your Chinese volumes are down. How much are they down and what trend have you seen this year? Is the trend improving or flat or what's going on there?
Steve Angel: Well, I would say that you know, if I look at Q3, it looks pretty flat to me and if you want to kind of step back and look at what's going on in China, generally speaking, Matt talked about the trends, Q3 to Q4. It just so happens golden week was the first week of October, and no pun intended, the golden week was very weak, and again that's the type of thing you expect, when the overall economy is not very strong. IP and GDP has been trending down over time. Automotive has not returned anywhere near its levels. The steel PMI Index has been in the mid 40s. The only thing keeping that going is infrastructure spend. Chemicals is probably one of the more stable parts of the market, that's kind of in the low 50s from a PMI standpoint. And we do look forward to a wave of relocations that we think will be coming, as a result of the environmental issues and clean up, driven by Beijing. Electronics is probably a bright spot, because the Chinese government is focusing so heavily on that. But clearly, China has been on a weakening trend. And again, we're not starting up large projects, as we speak, that can move that number fairly significantly. That will come later on.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude our Q&A portion. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Juan Pelaez for any closing remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Michelle, thank you. And thanks everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-05 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Linde Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call will be recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Juan Pelaez: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. This is Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations and I'm joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the pro forma numbers are in the appendix to this presentation. Steve and Matt will now give us an update on Linde. We will then be available to answer questions. Let me turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Angel: Thank you, Juan. This is our first full quarter operating as one company. As you can see we posted strong financials and raised guidance again for the full year. I'll come back to our expectations for the second half later. The sale of gas backlog of $4.7 billion has increased considerably as a result of the ExxonMobil Singapore project added this quarter. The Linde Engineering third-party backlog also remained strong at $5 billion bringing the total amount of project work to nearly $10 billion. We think a 50/50 relationship between sale of gas and third party is a nice balance. Our focus continues to be on sale of gas, but we certainly want to take advantage of all the good third-party business available to us. The sale of gas project proposal pipeline still has some momentum, driven primarily by petrochemical activity in the U.S., but also in Asia. Some milestones during the quarter. We deployed $1 billion to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks. We completed our squeeze out of the remaining shareholders of Linde AG. We closed on our South Korea divestiture and have reached agreement on one of the Indian divestitures. We now expect the value of our Asia divestitures to be in excess of $1.7 billion, which is higher than originally anticipated. We are making good progress on our cost synergies and restructuring initiatives. As expected, the timeline is more extended in regions like Europe where we need to engage the works councils on our restructuring plans. Having said that, discussions continue to be constructive. Integration is going well. The organization is set. Voluntary turnover remains at low levels. There is a high degree of energy and collaboration. The organization is adapting well to an accelerated operating rhythm. We have early wins we can point to in practically every area. There is a strong pool for best practices, technology, and client capabilities. In short, the organization is excited about the potential for our new company. Regarding the macro going forward I'm sure you're going to think I'm too cautious, too pessimistic. Maybe I am but this is a scenario that can easily play out. Let's start with Asia. Though a good result in Q2, I see more tepid volume growth going forward. China growth is slowing. The key PMI indicators are sliding. IP has been trending down and key metrics such as electricity consumed for industrial of production was only 0.5% higher in May. And for the entire economy electrical consumption was barely over 2%. China is slowing and so is the rest of Asia. The good news is project start-ups will provide some nice lift for us beginning next year. Europe. I see weakness across the Eurozone. Industrial production for June was negative 1.3% year-over-year. The fact we serve diverse end markets mitigates against this impact and we had a good self-help story. But the macro headwinds are clear. The Americas. Solid quarter in Q2 as pricing and merchant volume growth buoyed results. However, cylinder gases volumes, which primarily serve metal fabrication markets flat-lined in Q2 as hardgoods turned negative. However, pricing continues to be a good story here. After a sluggish start on the year due to a shortage of Venezuela crude, hydrogen volumes are improving as refiners take advantage of favorable margin spreads. Overall, we expect slowing growth with solid price attainment for the remainder of the year. Obviously, if the underlying global economy does well, we will do well. If it falters, we still have a resilient business model and a strong self-help story to sustain performance. My priorities going forward, best-in-class safety, compliance, sustainability and diversity, driving a successful integration and building a high-performance culture, synergy attainment, cost, CapEx and growth and implementing best-in-class price management systems and a robust productivity initiative. And now, I will turn it over to Matt.
Matt White: Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Slide 3 provides the second quarter adjusted pro forma results. As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in two ways. First, they are pro forma, which means periods are restated to assume an effective merger date of January 1, 2018, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and merger and restructuring-related costs. We believe this format best represents the underlying trends and performance of the combined business. Sales of $7.2 billion are flat with prior year, but up 4% sequentially from the first quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency translation reduced sales by 4% from 2018 and 1% from the first quarter. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened to almost every global currency, the major contributors are the Chinese RMB, Euro, British Pound and Australian Dollar. Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales increased 4% from the prior year and 5% from Q1. Versus the prior year, we continue to see positive pricing which is in line with globally weighted inflation of 2.5%. Volumes are also up 2% as project contributions and growth in Asia and U.S. are partially offset by softer conditions across EMEA and South Pacific. Sequentially, volumes are up 4%, primarily due to seasonal effects and higher project billings in engineering and price increased 1%. As Steve, mentioned price management continues to be an area of intense focus throughout the organization. Operating profit of $1.3 billion improved 6% over prior year and 8% from Q1 and when excluding FX, up 10% and 9% respectively. Operating margin expanded to 18.4% versus 17.4% in 2018 and 17.7% in the first quarter. Sequentially, we expanded operating margin by 70 basis points as we made good progress toward achieving the stated cost synergies. At this point, we are on track to reach the full annual run rate of $300 million by the end of this quarter, consistent with our merger commitment. Aside from the cost synergies, initiatives continue toward identifying and executing further value-creating opportunities in revenue and cost efficiencies. EPS of $1.83 improved 12% from last year or 16% when excluding impacts from foreign currency. The leverage improvement over operating margin is primarily due to lower interest expense, lower tax rate and less shares outstanding. I anticipate net interest to steadily increase each quarter as we deploy the divestiture proceeds and thus increase our debt levels. However, effective tax rate should remain around 24% for the full year and share count should steadily decline with the repurchase program activity. When comparing to the first quarter, you can see that net income growth of 8% is consistent with the operating profit growth as interest and tax levels were stable with a moderate decline in share count. Note that EBITDA sequential growth of 3% is slightly less, as we further align the presentation format resulting in a minor re-class between cost lines with no effect to operating profit. On top of delivering solid financial results this quarter, the Linde team secured additional future growth by expanding the sale of gas project backlog to $4.7 billion. As a reminder this backlog represents estimated CapEx spend for customer projects under construction and secured by long-term contracts that lead to incremental sales and earnings growth. The increase from last quarter is due to the inclusion of a recently signed contract in Singapore partially offset by smaller start-ups in Asia Pacific. In this quarter, we are also introducing a CapEx breakdown and return on capital metric. We intend to report these prospectively, so investors gain a better understanding of capital deployment and returns; two very critical metrics for this industry. The capital investments are broken into two categories: project CapEx which represents spending for the sale of gas project backlog; and base CapEx which represents everything else such as replacement, maintenance, cost reduction or smaller growth CapEx that does not qualify for the project backlog. It's important to differentiate between these two categories since project CapEx is lumpy with a high degree of certainty in returns more akin to acquisitions; whereas base CapEx defines traditional uses such as asset replacement and organic growth. Sequentially you can see that project CapEx is up 21%, primarily from project timing and a rising backlog. Note that the $200 million CapEx synergy target will be achieved through better base CapEx efficiency and asset utilization and improved procurement for all capital spending. The return on capital metric represents a rolling average of after-tax profit divided by a capital base represented as net debt plus equity. The full reconciliation can be found in the appendix. Note that the initial 10.4% figure is fairly consistent with the average of the two predecessor companies prior to the merger. Second quarter ROC of 10.6% is up 20 basis points in the first quarter, primarily due to higher profit on a stable capital base. Net debt of $11 billion increased about $3 billion from last quarter as expected, primarily due to the $3.2 billion squeeze-out payment. Net debt should continue to rise over the next several quarters as we recapitalize the balance sheet to meet our single A target credit rating. Please turn to slide four for an update on the full year guidance. Full year 2019 EPS estimate is in the range of $6.95 to $7.18, an increase of 12% to 16% from prior year or 15% to 19% when excluding 3% currency headwind. This range is 3% higher than last quarter due to faster synergy achievement in Q2 and more confidence in our self-help actions looking forward. However, we still anticipate softer volumes in the second half of the year as we are seeing more planned customer outages with demand softening in certain end markets such as manufacturing. Furthermore, global industrial production levels are leveling out or declining across most countries, which could have negative effects on packaged and merchant volumes. Of course this is just an assumption at this time and actual conditions will likely vary. Rest assured, if conditions are better than anticipated, we will not miss any volume growth opportunities given our breadth of coverage and contractual nature of this business. Also note that while we aren't providing quarterly guidance at this time, I would anticipate Q4 EPS to be slightly better than Q3, given synergy timing. In summary, if current volume levels remain stable or slightly improve, we would anticipate reaching the upper end or possibly above this guidance range. However, given the current economic environment, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious and manage the business accordingly. Despite these economic uncertainties, we have a unique foundation of synergy and efficiency opportunities coupled with a secured industry-leading project backlog to improve the business performance and quality. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nicola Tang from Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open.
Nicola Tang: Hi, everyone. Thanks for letting me ask the question or two actually. The first was on pricing. Obviously, this has been a key focus for you since closing the merger. I was wondering whether you have now managed to fully offset inflation with those price increases, which I think in your prepared remarks you might have said that you have. And then also, how should we think about pricing going forward in a more potentially volatile volume environment? And then the second question was on cash flow. I was wondering whether you could talk a little bit about the moving parts on the operating cash flow, because it looks like the conversion worsened a little bit quarter-on-quarter and I was wondering if you could explain what's driving that and also call off -- call out any one-offs or anything related to restructuring and other. And also remind us of phasing of other sort of exceptional items on cash flow this year? Thank you.
Steve Angel: All right, so this is Steve. I'm going to take the pricing question then I'm going to flip it over to Matt to answer the cash flow question. So regarding does pricing equal inflation. I would say in certain parts of the world the answer is, yes. You can see we averaged 2%. I don't know if our land in the Americas was 3%. We had certain businesses higher than that. And if you go around the world, there's kind of plus and minus around that number. I would say we still have some work to do in terms of making sure that all of our pricing actions at least offset the cost inflation that we've been seeing and will see going forward. So that work is not done. I said in my comments, it was one of my key priorities going forward to have a best-in-class price management system. That entails much more than just a price versus a cost inflation number. It's how you manage pricing, contracts, product management all of that. Matt?
Matt White: Yes. Thanks, Steve. And just to add one thing to Steve's Nicola that while we showed 2% that was a fairly strong 2%. It just happened the way the rounding and footing work that shows us 2%, so as per the comments that's pretty much right in line with the 2.5% globally weighted inflation. Regarding the cash flow, I think as you may have alluded to I think the best way to probably look at this is what is the conversion rate of our adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow. And we talked a little bit about this in the first quarter as well. And I'll talk to the operating cash flow on a half basis, first half, because as you can imagine, there's some parts that move between quarters. So when you look at historically, the last five years of both predecessor companies, the first half of the year, you tended to see operating cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA at around 70% 7-0. For the full-year, that number was closer to maybe 77%. So as you could imagine the back half is usually stronger almost the mid-80s and the front half is usually around 70%. So I think that's the benchmark we want to look at from a cash conversion ratio, if you want to refer to it that way. So looking at our particular numbers, as you know our adjusted EBITDA for the first half is about $4 billion and our current operating cash flow year-to-date is about $2.1 billion. So applying that 70%, that would mean we're looking for more like $2.8 billion versus the $2.1 billion, so about $0.7 billion short of where we'd want to be. So why are we right? I think that's the question. $0.5 billion or $0.5 billion is all these one-off merger costs. We've got almost $400 million are related to either taxes on gains, costs to do the divestitures, merger cash costs that carried over and some change in control costs that triggered acceleration of retirement benefits. There's another $100 million of restructuring severance related. So those $0.5 billion are really one-off in nature and that's something that will subside here in the next couple of quarters, especially the merger related and we'll have a little bit more restructuring in the next probably 18 months to 24 months. We've got $100 million what's called contract liabilities and what that really relates to is last year, our engineering business had significant prepayments from their customer base, which is a good thing. That's them managing the working capital quite well, but we've lapped that. Now they are executing and building some of those projects so that's about $100 million of some unfavorable timing but that is the nature an EPC-type business. And the remaining $100 million is some working capital that frankly we got to get after. That's something we've got to do better on. We've got a lot of initiatives internally. We're working towards that. So that last $100 million is something that I'm personally focused on, Steve's focused on to kind of get back to the right levels. But I fully expect the second half numbers to start stepping up especially as we lap a lot of these merger cash payments. And at this point I see no reason why we're not going to demonstrate the legacy company average of the cash conversion rate from OCF to adjusted EBITDA.
Nicola Tang: Thank you. That’s helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Duffy Fischer: Yes good morning. Congrats on a good quarter. First question is just, can you talk about with more focus on the backlog now as we get into 2020. How does that compare with the start-ups coming out of the backlog 2020 versus 2019?
Steve Angell: So Duffy we have said that this was going to be a fairly tepid year in terms of contributions from large project startups, something on order of probably 1% and I'm going to say 1% sales and EPS. Going forward certainly the timing of start-ups says we're going to have a stronger 2020 over 2019, so here again regardless of the macro environment, we do have a stronger backlog contribution in 2020. I would -- I'm looking at something more like a 2% contribution over 2019 top and bottom. And then based on the strength of what we have going forward, I'd say probably through a 2023 time frame because I'm looking at a very big project start-up there I would look for 2% kind of as an average annual growth rate top and bottom going forward. I think that's certainly in the cards. And again that's compared to 1% this year. So if you think about the sales algorithm going forward, we have the macro, the underlying macro very much driven by industrial production. I think that is a more of a questionable number by the day. But on top of that, we expect price management contributions. On top of that, we expect backlog contributions. And at some point, we're going to start to see more noticeable effects from growth synergies. So that's the way we look at it.
Duffy Fischer: Terrific. And then one a little bit more specific. On your hydrogen business, do you see a meaningful impact from IMO 2020?
Steve Angell: I would say meaningful in the sense that the Singapore ExxonMobil project in part is predicated based on IMO 2020. Again where they are positioned in Singapore, marine fuels is a very important end product for them. So I would say that was certainly driven in part by IMO 2020. But aside from that and I've looked at this before, we may have a few projects over a number years principally in Southeast Asia. But in terms of what we see refiners do to get prepared for this, it looks to me like it's more a case of they have coker capacity or they're adding coker capacity. They're very comfortable operating cokers. They've been doing this for many, many years quite well. Some of them are looking towards more sweet crude feedstocks. Some of them aren't going to do anything. They're going to wait and see how it all plays out, so that's how I'd answer that.
Duffy Fischer: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Mike Sison: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Stephen, in terms of your outlook -- given some of the cautiousness you outlined for the regions -- you did 3% volume growth in the first, 2% in the third. Are you kind of seeing 1% to 2% as we enter the second half, or maybe just give us your thoughts on what volume growth you need to get to the low end as well of your range for this year?
Steve Angel: We're actually seeing slower growth coming off of Q2. So you can say at best flat, but we're certainly cautious as you can tell in my comments. But if you were to look at what would it take to be at the bottom-end of the range and of course, you've got to be careful here because I don't know what currencies are going to do. So you have to take that out of the equation. The rest of those is much more controllable. But you would have to be -- I would say, we would have to be in the negative mid single-digit range to really find ourselves at the bottom-end of the range. It's possible. Certainly things are -- when you woke up this morning you probably weren't as optimistic as you were last week. But that's kind of the expectations. It's I'd say at best flat and then certainly on the bottom-end of the range kind of a minus mid single-digit volume growth rate.
Mike Sison: Okay. And then just in terms of the synergy you talked about the time lines in Europe a little bit extended, but you've got a lot of early wins or so I guess in a lot of areas. Can you maybe highlight a couple of areas that could do better this year that gives you confidence in the second half?
Steve Angel: Well, I would say when you look at well the synergy plan as we've been implementing it certainly in places like Asia we got off the mark very quickly. Momentum is still building. I think in Americas we got off the mark pretty quickly. You look at a place like South America, they integrated very quickly. And in the U.S., we've been working I think at a satisfactory place in terms of addressing actions that we knew we could take. Europe takes a little bit longer. We knew this coming in. We need to have -- go through the works council process. It's a very detailed process, but I think it's very constructive. We're already taking initial steps with them. We've had a couple of meetings. It's moving forward. I don't have any concerns regarding our ability to do what we need to do, but we certainly need to work through the process and respect the process. And I think that's important and that's what we're doing. We do have a strong team on the ground in Europe and I'm confident that as we go forward we're going to see the synergy attainment. I'm also -- feel confident that we're going to see other areas of the business perform better as well including price management and including productivity initiatives.
Mike Sison: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Gorman from UBS. Your line is now open. 
Ben Gorman: Hi, guys. Just two quick ones for me, if that's okay. First of all, in terms of price competitiveness in the industry, I was just wondering whether you could comment on whether it's changed at all particularly with the mid-tier peers post the closure of the merger? And then secondly, just on the exit rate in terms of volumes. I know you gave a little bit of color a minute ago, but any indication as to whether the 2% was a strong or sort of weaker 2%? And maybe particularly in Europe the areas leading that slight decline that you've seen. Thanks.
Steve Angel: Well, I would say with respect to competitiveness -- there are strong competitors around the globe. And Europe has strong competitors, China certainly has very strong competitors. We have very strong competitors in the U.S. other parts of the world. So with respect to bidding and winning on new projects and things like that it's a competitive environment, which is what we expected we would be in. We like obviously the capabilities we have and our ability to win with the capabilities that we have. You know, but certainly it remains a competitive market. And can you help me a little bit with your second question? I didn't quite pick that up.
Ben Gorman: The second question's really about, sort of, the exit rate. So you, sort of, mentioned things getting slightly tougher by the day. I'm just, sort of, wondering whether the exit rate particularly in Europe is sort of already close to maybe down a few percent and on a global basis as well. Thanks. 
Steve Angel: Yeah. Well, no. I would say – so exit rate. So, as I'm looking at – look at Europe. For example, the industrial production has been trending down. I think that's going to be the trend going forward. You have obviously the prospects of Brexit and the headlines certainly on the continent are not all that positive. So, I think that is what we are facing going forward. With respect to China, obviously the news that has come out says that, I think we're going to be in for a tougher road going forward. If I could talk about it market-by-market it, certainly I think it's overall going to be net weaker going forward. The Americas with respect to industrial production manufacturing has been trending down as well. And so I – it's not like, it's falling off a cliff, but it certainly has been a noticeable trend. So that's why I've said before, I'm really more optimistic about our ability to manage pricing going forward than I am about the underlying volume fundamentals. And then if you look at a place like South America, though there was a recent positive news with respect to addressing needed pension reforms, it remains to be seen, if they're able to really turn the corner with respect to growth and we'll see. So that's kind of the global summary.
Matt White: And I think -- this is Matt, just to add just one point to that. When thinking about volumes year-over-year on the back half maybe a little more challenging. You may recall fourth quarter was worse than third quarter. There was a bit of a decline of that perspective. So, I think thinking about it sequential might help, I mean, as Steve had mentioned Q2 as a base mark this year sequentially we are expecting some decline off of Q2, and I think for modeling – on that perspective that might be an easier way to think about it.
Ben Gorman: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
John McNulty: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I guess two quick ones. Does the macro weakness that you're seeing right now does that require or facilitate more cost cutting as you kind of look forward beyond just the synergy-related or efficiency-related programs that you've already got in place?
Steve Angel: The answer John to that is, yes. I mean, as we look at areas that – we've always had the philosophy that we need to be adjusting to market conditions. We need to be on top of changes that are taking place. That's a philosophy we've had for a long time. We've never really had done much in the way of big programs. I can think of one in maybe 20 years. But yes in addition to the restructuring initiatives that we had outlined as a result of the merger, I'd also talked about a productivity initiative which is kind of a continuous improvement something that's very important for us to have going forward. But certainly, as we see market conditions change the expectation is that each geography will adapt whether it's pertains to a merger cost synergy or not that they will be making the necessary adaptations. So that's something that we follow very closely when we do our monthly calls.
John McNulty: Got it. Thanks for the color on that. And then I guess with regard to the merchant pricing environment clearly getting some strength there and recapturing some of the inflation that's been nicking away over the last couple of years. But I guess, are you seeing any volumes walking away, or are you seeing any changes in behavior from your customers, or is this something more that they're accepting of because of what you would do to get it?
Steve Angel: I would say – and obviously this is something that not only do we are we careful to pay attention to here, but you can imagine at a local level, they are very much sensitive to volume walking away as a result to perhaps too aggressive a pricing posture. I would say for the most part, I have not seen a loss of volume as a result of too aggressive a posture on price.
John McNulty: Great. Thanks very much for the color.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale.
Peter Clark: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Yeah, three questions if I can. First one, actually for Steve again, price management you talked about price up in all regions. Would that be all key territories? And I'm thinking here particularly of Australia where your peer mentioned that pricing for them at least was down. You mentioned Brexit, I guess there's not a tremendous amount you can do about a do-or-die Brexit. It's more about the customers. But what can you prepare for that, because, obviously, it impacts U.K. and continental Europe pretty significantly. And the third point probably for Matt. The base CapEx, Matt is running about 7% of sales. Now Linde always had a much higher maintenance CapEx for various reasons, but one of which was mix and an almost cylinder army or all the cylinders they had. Anyway they said that was one of the reasons they had much higher maintenance CapEx. Just wondering if there's a structural issue that means that you won't get a base CapEx to where you were, but clearly you will improve on where in the world. Thank you.
Steve Angel: Okay, Peter. So with respect to let's say markets that were unaffected by the merger and you brought up Australia. Clearly, there are others. We found if I go back in my Praxair days that we had certain geographies that did a good job with price management and you can spend a day with them and see they really understood what was going on in the marketplace, what was going on with cost, what was going on with supply and demand and things that needed -- they needed to do to address that. And so the whole idea is to make sure that we bring that same rigor, that same discipline, that same competency, that same organizational approach to every corner of the globe. And we have had -- I've had those reviews with Australia. You mentioned Australia and this is something they have been working on ever since the merger. I expect to see positive results not only out of Australia, but out of many other countries around the world as we continue to build that muscle. With respect to Brexit, the deindustrialization of the U.K. has been going on for a long time, so Brexit is not the point where that starts to happen. So, clearly, that's an effect that we have been feeling for a long time in the U.K. What I think the team has done a great job of and will continue to do a great job of is building out resilient markets more growth in resilient markets. And I'm thinking of health care, I'm thinking of food and beverage, I'm thinking of a myriad of applications that they have been bringing to the marketplace. So that very much has dampened the effect of the deindustrialization trend. And so I don't expect a big change coming out of Brexit. I certainly don't expect positive growth going forward as a result, but I certainly don't expect a big change. And Matt, do you want to answer the base -- or I can answer and you can answer.
Matt White: Yeah. Yeah, sure. Peter, just a couple of things as you probably know, but just to make clear. Obviously, our base CapEx as we defined it here does include small growth. And that can also mean ECOVAR or VPSAs standard plants as legacy Praxair called them. So to have an apples-to-apples comparison may not be the same across the industry. But to your point when I look at legacy Praxair that had reported this now, we were on a $750 million to $800 million-type year run rate. So just thinking of that in simple terms, if you double that that would be around $1.5 billion $1.6 billion a year, if you felt the company size doubled. Right now the run rate on Q2 is about $1.8 billion. Of the $200 million of CapEx synergies, a large portion of that would be dedicated to this area. This is an area that's getting a lot of focus. You saw sequentially, we had a little bit of a decline, but this is something we're going to keep working at. We tend not to look it as a percentage of sales. More really it's a detailed bottoms-up how we look at that internally what projects we need. But I can tell you reliability as you know is critical in this industry. That's not something we're going to compromise. But when we look at the other growth or small growth initiatives on things like cylinders, trailers, tanks given the economic outlook, we laid out that's an area, I would see probably less spending going forward. Those spend tend to correlate more to IP. So this is kind of how we'll look at it. But clearly, the CapEx synergies of $200 million, this base CapEx is going to be an area of intense focus.
Peter Clark: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. In looking over your pricing in the various regions, if you compare your average prices to the numbers that came out of your competitor in Allentown, your price gains are smaller, particularly in Asia and Europe. What do you make of that?
Steve Angel: Well, you have to understand we've been working on pricing for quite some time. So, if you go back over a period of time, you would see our price gains have been there year-over-year. You also have to take into consideration that we have -- every competitor has a bit of a different mix. If I look at Europe, we're half packaged gases. So, the ability to move through pricing very much is through, I don't know how many -- probably a million transactions or so through those small welders. So, that is the mix that we have there. If we look at Asia, obviously, our mix is a bit different than some of our competitors. We have Australia, which is a very large piece. Australia and China are the two largest countries that we have that represent Asia. If I look down beneath the covers, which I think is always important because you've got to keep in mind what we're reporting is an aggregated number. But, I can look at China merchant price, and it's 5% year-over-year. So, that number is very strong. Again, we've got some work to do across the board to bring everything up to an expectation that we would have. If I going to look at the Americas, for example, 3% number but U.S. merchant is 6%, South America is 5%, packaged is 3%. And then if I were to look at Europe, I'd say it's pretty much -- a pretty strong 2% kind of price increase number. But again, it's very much affected by what's going on in mix. And I'll give you another small example of that. If I look at our small business called refrigerants that number is off quite a bit, and so -- year-over-year. So, that all kind of fits into the calculation, but it's quite -- quite a bit's driven by mix. But we certainly have a focus on working on every aspect, every channel, every product, every market across the globe.
Matt White: And Jeff, this is Matt. Just to add one thing to that to Steve's comments. As you can imagine year-over-year calculating that on the pro forma bottom details, we do our best. But sequential, we tend to look at more intently just given -- since the merger effective date really Q1 and Q2. And I think on a sequential basis, you'll find numbers are more comparable. So, I just tend to keep that in mind as we look forward.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. And then for my follow-up, your adjusted interest expense was $35 million in the quarter, which I think is about 1% of your net debt. Is there something unusual in the $35 million number? And what's a more normal number if there is one?
Matt White: Yes, Jeff. This is Matt. So obviously we have a lot of cash, that's earning income that we are managing around the world, so you have interest income that's netting against that. 
Jeff Zekauskas: Sure.
Matt White: So, we are flush with a lot of cash. As we lever up, and do more distributions, primarily through buybacks, you will start to see a shift. And you will see higher net interest, but then you'll see lower share count, and that's part of the recapitalization, I mentioned in the prepared comments.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Would really like to hear your view on what you've learned most from the integration of these two legacy companies with respect to what has surprised you. Anything that you would note that's more favorable than you expected or perhaps more unfavorable?
Steve Angel: Well, this is Steve. I would -- nothing really comes to mind that says this is less favorable than what we had hope for. I would say, as we get into -- for example, Linde Engineering has very strong capabilities, very strong discipline, strong record of project execution. Many people think that it's all large project-driven, but a good 40% or so, is very small projects that they execute day-in and day-out. So, the capabilities, the strengths within that business certainly are obvious. As I look at application capabilities, it's a story of where I would say that, we've been very strong in things like oxygen combustion. Linde's been very strong in areas like clean fuels, healthcare. We both have worked on food and beverage. We both have worked on digitalization. The combined capability is very positive. I would say that, certainly, some technologies like cylinder tracking is something that legacy Linde was very much out front with. Specialty gas capability, legacy Praxair had good capabilities, Linde has excellent capabilities. Together, we have a much stronger portfolio. When you get into productivity tools, we each develop productivity tools. Praxair, obviously, was very proud of the productivity track record, but Linde has excellent capabilities too. You just put it all together. That's why I said at the beginning that all the employees, the 80-some-thousand employees within the company are very optimistic about the potential of the new company.
Steve Byrne: And, Steve, you mentioned engineering, 40% are small projects. How would you split that roughly $5 billion in backlog between gases and non-gases. Is that shifting one way or the other? And how do you view the value proposition of having both of those skill sets?
Steve Angell: Well, if you look at the $5 billion of backlog I would say that today in that backlog, natural gas processing plants, olefin plants would be probably half or so of that backlog, maybe a little bit more. And then the rest runs the gamut of ASUs and HyCO and also some other small projects that would be part of that backlog number. I think, having capabilities around the olefin crackers, there's certain examples that has led to pull-through of ASUs and other industrial gas products as a result of having that upfront project. Clearly, when you're talking about ethane crackers and natural gas plants, the level of -- the level at which you engage the customer is higher, because clearly there's an interest at the highest levels of the organization with our customers in terms of talking to us about those kinds of projects, because they're very critical to their processes. So those are certainly positives that I can point to. I can also look at natural gas processing capability and point to where that is a good source of helium, which has been in short supply, continues to be in short supply. So having that upstream capability puts us in a very positive position, with respect to capturing helium off of that process. So that's how I would address that.
Steve Byrne: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning, Matt and Steve. Just on the synergies, what are you targeting in the back half of the year now on the cost synergies?
Steve Angell: Well, I said, $225 million was the approximate synergy number. We had a good quarter in Q2, so we made a good dent in that number. Matt has said that we are approaching -- will be at the full run rate, so you're looking at a run rate in two for something like $75 million kind of run rate, so Q3 will probably less than that, should be less than that and I think that's the right way to think about it.
David Begleiter: Very good. And just on the buybacks, how should we think about the cadence with buybacks in the back half of the year?
Matt White: David, yes, this is Matt. So as you can see we are in the market every day, as you probably see from some of the reports and that's something we plan to continue to do to be a participant every day. And when we find opportunities, we'll obviously take advantage of that. That means that the last few days have been a good example, where there may be macro events, completely unrelated to us, could be good opportunities to come in and repurchases the stock. But, obviously, we have the authority, we have the cash. We're in every day and whether times to be opportunistic, we will continue to do that.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Laurence Alexander: Hi, there. Just a couple of questions. One is, with respect to the softer volume outlook that you flagged, how soft would volumes need to get for you to worry about the cadence of pricing slowing down? And secondly, on FX, we normally talk about currency with respect to the translation effects on the P&L. At what point does the backlog get fixed from a currency perspective? That is if you have a large project during 2022, at what point do we pin down the currency that will be used for translation effects going forward?
Steve Angell: Okay. So I'll just take the first question. I think this is going to be something that we have to look at geography by geography, product by product, market by market, in terms of understanding negative volumes and the impact that it can have on pricing. I think, -- you know I think its clear that if you had a substantial drop in volumes. And that contributed to a high level of supply versus demand, in the marketplace, that could put some downward pressure on pricing. So I think I'd have to look at that, in term of, where it's going to actually materialize with respect to, what it would do. My view is we would still deliver some positive pricing even if it fell, to a level like that. Then I'm going to let Matt answer, the currency -- how we handle currency and projects, we have in the future.
Matt White: Yeah Laurence, so, as you know, when we make these investments, they're 15-to-20 year horizons. So, throughout that timeframe, currencies go up and down. And to account for that, we always embed in our financial analyses, a sovereign and currency risk, in every country we operate in. So we essentially mandate, that the return can recover the known risks, within those contracts. And obviously if you can get upwards of 100% inflation coverage in your escalation that has a natural balance on devaluations, because usually after devaluation inflation follows. So these are the mechanisms that we do, to recover. Compound inflation on a local basis, can often exceed the effects of the foreign currency translation over that same time period. So these are all mechanisms you do when contracting to ensure you get an appropriate return, inflation coverage to mitigate against that. As far as the actual execution itself, in procuring equipment, whether it's Turbomachinery in Europe or coal boxes in China et cetera, we may or may not use derivatives on that, 1-year, 2-year, invoicing exposure. That would be translational -- or transactional. I'm sorry to your point. So that's more of a derivative, decision. But long range, we feel we have very strong contractual and return requirements to offset that.
David Begleiter: Thank you.
Steve Angell: Thank you.
Matt White: I think we have time for one more.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.
P. J. Juvekar: Yes. Thank you. You mentioned that, IP or Industrial Production is slowing down around the world. How quickly do you see that in your packaged volumes? And you also mentioned that hardgoods, -- hardgoods turned negative. Is that a historically harbinger of slower industrial activity?
Steve Angell: So, I'll just take the last one. So when hardgoods turns negative, and in this case you see less large equipment, large welding equipment being ordered and so forth, it just says that your customers are becoming more cautious about the outlook going forward. And typically that would be the first sign. Then you start to see the consumables slow along with the gas volumes. So, it's not like it fell 30%. So if you go back in 2009, that's what we saw in the United States Hardgoods fell 30%. But it did fell to negative territory, which says that, it's certainly not a positive indication with respect to growth rates going forward. Not falling off a cliff, but it does signal a weakening trend. Again, I think about cylinder gases, as very much tied to industrial production. And I made mention the fact that, in Europe, half of our business is packaged gases. So that's very much tied to the manufacturing economy. And you can look at the trends with respect to the Eurozone, with respect to more negative trends on industrial production. And I anticipate the same thing as I look across Asia, that the trend for industrial production has been walking down. The PMI indicators for, metals, chemicals, has been walking down. And therefore, that just signifies to me, that there's going to be some weakness ahead. Manufacturing certainly is weaker in China than it has been. And so therefore that has a big effect on cylinder gases, but not just cylinder gases, other products as well.
P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you for that Steve. And then your energy backlog is roughly half of your total backlog. With energy prices down from peak levels, what does that mean for your future backlog?
Steve Angel: Well, we'll see. But energy prices have been all over the place and of course kind of oil prices have been bouncing all over the place for the last several years, very volatile. Natural gases prices have been down and staying down in the U.S. as there is an abundance of shale gas. That's something everybody is very familiar with. If I look at the types of projects that we're working on today, it tells me that there's still a lot of room to go in places like the U.S. Gulf Coast, a lot of chemical activity, but also refinery activity still continues to be very positive. So the outlook certainly with respect to the U.S. Gulf Coast, I think is going to be positive and again more driven by natural gas than anything else. We talk a little bit about the impact of IMO 2020 and there is some impact. Clearly that's the big Singapore project that we talked about. And there are some other projects that we're working on in Asia; both on the refinery side, and also on the chemicals side, not massive. But I think, could be significant as we go forward overall in the backlog. So I think, it's still pretty positive environment particularly, if you look at the U.S. Gulf Coast.
P.J. Juvekar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Juan Pelaez, Director of Investor Relations for any further remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Nicole, thank you. And thanks everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-10 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q1 2019 Linde Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Juan Pelaez. Please go ahead.
Juan Pelaez: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast. This is Juan Pelaez, Head of Investor Relations and I am joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt White, Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at linde.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. The reconciliations of the adjusted pro forma numbers are in the appendix of this presentation. Steve and Matt will now review Linde's first quarter results and provide a full year outlook. We will then be available to answer questions. Let me now turn the call over to Steve.
Steve Angell: Thanks, Juan. Just a few comments before I turn it over to Matt. Our hold separate order was lifted on March 1, so the first quarter contains only one month of combined operations. Good start to the year, 12% EPS growth, some positive leverage from sales and operating profit as a result pricing and cost synergies. We paid $477 million in dividends and purchased $700 million of stock, net of issuances, in addition to the $600 million purchased in December of last year. The backlog remains healthy at $3.5 billion. This excludes a project that many of you have heard about, which is a project with ExxonMobil in Singapore that value to us will be about $1.4 billion of capital investment. Jurong Island in Singapore is ExxonMobil's largest integrated manufacturing complex and is anchored by a 600,000-barrel per day refinery. They are investing $5 billion in their largest downstream project, which goes by the acronym of CRISP. We are building four gasifiers to tie into two existing gasifiers that Linde operates today. We will be taking pitch from ExxonMobil and returning hydrogen, oxogas and nitrogen to ExxonMobil, as well as hydrogen and carbon monoxide to multiple customers via by our pipeline system. You can see our project is very much integrated into ExxonMobil's new project. This project will be executed by Linde Engineering. We see a solid return anchored by a base facility fee structure and we expect contract signing to be in the next 30 to 60 days. Regarding key milestones. We completed the squeeze out of our minority Linde AG shareholders on April 8. We announced the divestiture of our South Korea assets on April 30, which represents about 75% of the expected value from our required divestitures in Asia. All our employees are excited about the merger. We see a strong pull for application technology as we begin to appreciate each other's capabilities a strong pull for plant capabilities and best practices in every aspect of our business. We are currently working through a very detailed cost and restructuring initiatives. We held our first zero based budget review for all corporate functions a few weeks ago and I have to say that I'm pleased with the progress we're making. Key priorities going forward: a successful integration, obviously; price management to make sure that we're covering cost inflation all around the world; delivering on our cost, CapEx and growth synergies; and building a high-performance culture in every sense of the word. Regarding guidance, I'll let Matt elaborate further, but we may be a bit conservative at this point. Just keep in mind, we're only one month into this merger. And now I'll turn it over to Matt.
Matt White: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. On slide 3, you'll find the first quarter adjusted pro forma results. As a reminder, these figures are modified from U.S. GAAP in two ways. First, they're pro forma, which means all periods are recast to reflect the merger, including removal of the regulatory mandated divestitures. Second, figures have been adjusted to exclude items not indicative of ongoing business trends, which primarily relate to purchase price accounting and one-time merger and restructuring related costs. Going forward, we'll continue to present numbers in this format since they best represent the trends on the combined business. Sales of $6.9 billion are even with prior year, driven by a negative 5% foreign currency headwind. Virtually every foreign currency has devalued against the U.S. dollar with most losing 5% to 10%. You may recall that the first half of 2018 had a weaker U.S. dollar than the second half, so I expect this trend to continue for the second quarter.  Excluding foreign currency, underlying sales grew 5% comprised of 3% volume and 2%. We achieved mid to high single-digit growth rates across every segment with the exception of EMEA, which only grew 1% due to a slowing economy evidenced by weaker industrial production levels. Global price of 2% was in line with inflation, although we are actively working to further increase prices to recover higher input costs. The combination of price improvements and volume contribution enabled 6% growth or 40 basis point improvement to underlying gross margins. Note that the late start to the merger hampered our ability to achieve variable cost savings this quarter. However, since March 1, we've been actively integrating procurement, productivity and logistical resources to enable further improvement in gross margin, as existing supply contracts are renegotiated. Operating profit grew faster than gross profit, resulting in a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin to 17.7%. Overall, fixed cost synergies are tracking to expectations, although we are making faster progress in corporate than the segments due to the restrictive commercial and operational interfaces prior to March 1. We fully anticipate synergies to continue to ramp throughout the year, as we have more time to integrate the two organizations. Diluted EPS of $1.69 was 17% above the prior year when excluding foreign exchange impact. The improved leverage from operating profit was due to lower net interest, lower tax rate and a lower share count. Net interest was favorable to prior year, primarily from higher cash balances and lower debt levels. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% and is anticipated to remain around that level for the rest of this year. The global treasury and tax teams are actively working to find further capital structure synergies above the stated $1.1 billion target, and I believe they're off to a solid start. Finally, net share count is lower due to the stock repurchase program. Through April, the company has repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and will continue to buy more throughout the year. At the end of March, net debt was $8.1 billion, when excluding purchase price accounting effects. This does not include the Linde AG squeeze-out cash payment of $3.2 billion or the Korean divestiture proceeds of $1.2 billion, both of which occurred in April of this year. The sale gas project backlog remains at $3.5 billion as a startup in South Korea was replaced with the new project win in the Netherlands. In addition, our engineering business is off to a good start, with a healthy project backlog of $5 billion. Both backlogs will provide future, contractually secured growth over the next three years. Please turn to slide four, which provides an update of the 2019 outlook. We are increasing the full year EPS growth rate to a range of 9% to 13%, or 12% to 16% excluding anticipated currency headwinds. We expect positive contribution from cost synergies to continue to ramp each quarter as integration efforts are implemented. Furthermore, the projected FX headwind of negative 3% is primarily front-end loaded with a negative 4% to negative 5% occurring in the first half of this year and negative 1% to negative 2% headwind for the second half. Although, we are not providing second quarter EPS guidance at this time, we anticipate moderate Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement from ramping synergies. We expect further improvement into the third quarter, so second half EPS levels should be higher than the first half. Overall, this outlook incorporates improving cost synergies but some softening of industrial production growth rates. If current volume trends and economic conditions maintain or improve we would be at the upper end of this range or possibly better. However, at this time we believe it's prudent to guide to these levels while we integrate the combined organization in an uncertain economy. I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Mike Sison: Hey, guys. Nice star to the year. Matt just in terms of your outlook regarding softening of industrial production, you did 3% volume growth in the first quarter total. Some of that has project growth in it. What's sort of the underlying like current growth rate that you're seeing that would sort of get you to the upper end if it stays at this level?
Matt White: Yeah. I think Mike as discussed, if you assume things were flat that kind of flat to declining is how we view the current. Now, obviously on a year-over-year basis things were pretty strong, especially in the first and into the second and third quarter of last year. So on a year-over-year basis I wouldn't anticipate much change on those rates. It's more sequential the way to think about it. But as discussed, if sequentially this kind of trends hold we would definitely believe we'd be at the upper end. So we'll have to see, but we absolutely feel quite confident on our synergies and what we can deliver in the self-help and it's just a matter of where foreign currency rates go where underlying volumes go.
Mike Sison: Okay. And as a quick follow-up it does sound to some degree that there could be some conservatism here. When you think about what you can control to help move yourself to the upper end where do you think that'll come from? And is it more just your ability to execute on the synergies growth pricing? Give us some your thoughts there.
Steve Angell: Mike, this is Steve. Obviously, currency is something that's difficult to control and volumes to a large extent, we don't control. The things we do control are obviously cost synergies and that's something we're all very, very focused on today and we want to deliver that as soon as we can. And I'll also add price management. We have to make sure that in every corner of the world that we're doing everything we can to offset cost inflation both prior cost inflation and the current cost inflation that we're seeing. Those are things that we can control. Matt talked about net interest benefit, so I won't say any more about that. But those are the controllables and that's what we're focused.
Mike Sison: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
David Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Steve your Asia margins are level of those of your U.S. peer. Can you discuss the reasons why and the opportunity to raise those margins over the medium to longer term?
Steve Angell: Well, I mean we all have different geographical profiles when you look across Asia and for example in our case the new Linde case, China is a prominent player, but also Australia is a prominent player. And Australia, unfortunately has had a long period of I'll call it the industrialization more of a secular trend, and so that's something that, we have to address. And you can see in the comments that, Asia sales if we had -- take out Australia, and take out the effective divestitures the rest of its plus 10%. So, those numbers are pretty good. And that's without the benefit of really the much in the way of large project contribution. So, clearly we have some opportunities here. We had more integration from a regional business standpoint. There's more integration in Asia than anywhere else. So, we have some cost synergy opportunities there. Clearly, inflation has been something that's been very apparent, in that region for many years. And we need to make sure that we focus on that. But clearly, the objective is to steadily increase, a quality of our business there as measured by operating margins.
Matt White: Yeah. And I would just add David, as you know contract the nature of a contract can play a big part as well, whether you opt to pass through power or elect tolling arrangements. Most of our contracts across Asia are passing through power. It's just from an IRR perspective from a return from a cash flow they're similar. But margin profile may be a little bit different. So those are things, I think also consider when comparing.
David Begleiter: Very helpful and Matt, just on synergies from Q1 to Q2 the ramp, how should we think about that from a maybe a dollar perspective?
Steve Angell: I'll take that. This is Steve. As we look at synergies for the year. And I'm sure you all remember last call I gave you a number of about $225 million of cost synergies for the year, about 70% of that, I'd say is going to be at the back half. And even a little more weighted towards Q4. So, really kind of minimal synergies, in Q1 because of the limited time we had to work on it, starts to ramp in Q2. But again 70% or, so back half.
David Begleiter: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Duffy Fischer: Hi. Good morning guys. First question is, now with what seems official the tariffs on China business. I'm sure you've done a lot of war gaming. Walk us through kind of how you've thought about that? How that may impact your business if those tariffs end up kind of being long-lived?
Steve Angell: Well, Duffy, I would say that unlike companies who have global supply chains. And depend on China for exports for the United States, so global supply chains coming exports going the other way or even vice versa. As you know our business is very local. So the product is produced and sold locally. So the direct effect is minimal. But there is a potential for indirect effect…
Duffy Fischer: Yes.
Steve Angell: … as our customers start to see the effects on their business. So, I don't have a number to put on this. I'll say it's something that we'll continue to observe to work, to make sure that we position ourselves as well as possible. But it also kind of leads me to not the point you were making but another point which is, we have a very stable business model. And again, product is produced locally. It's sold locally. That's the focus of our organizational structure. We generate high cash flow, pretty much throughout the cycle. When the CapEx opportunities start to limit themselves, we have more free cash flow to redeploy to share buybacks and potentially increasing dividends. So, we view ourselves, as a very safe port in the storm. And you can see in my earlier comments that I said, I want to make sure that we're increasing our operating margins, the quality of our operating businesses, regardless of what the economic environment may be.
Duffy Fischer: Great, thanks. And then just a second one, on the engineering business, because that's the business I would say, we're all less familiar with. Now that you've had a chance to kind of come in and look at that is that run as you would want it? Or when you look back some of the business they've been on isn't right? Just I guess structurally how could that business look different three years from now?
Steve Angell: Well, to -- the way it could look different three years from now, we have all agreed internally that we want to shift the balance of Linde Engineering's business more towards over-the-fence projects versus third-party sales. We think that's a healthier place for that business to be overtime. But even beyond that, we all know that the sweet spot of our industry is the over-the-fence business model and we want to make sure that we are as competitive as we can possibly be in driving selling gas business opportunities. So that really is the focus going forward. So if you were to say that maybe historically Linde Engineering would be 20% internal over-the-fence and 80% external, if we can get that more balanced something closer to 50-50, I think that's a much better place to be. If I look at the Singapore project which Linde Engineering will be executing I take a lot of comfort in the fact that they really have all the capabilities, the experiences, the disciplines, the know-how to execute very complex projects like that. And if they couldn't believe me, ExxonMobil would not have selected us. So that's something I'm beginning to appreciate more and more as I get into this.
Duffy Fischer: Great, thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the Nicola Tang with Exane.
Nicola Tang: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And thank you for the helpful comments on net debt and what's happening in Q1. And could you just give us a reminder of – and the bridge from here to year-end in terms of are the disposals on track or perhaps better than you originally thought? Is the buyback going as per what you expected?  And then I had a second question. On Europe which seems to be the weakest area are there any specific end markets which underperformed versus others? And when you talk about your outlook for the year, assuming that actually market conditions get worse, are there any specific geographies or end markets that you would point to?
Matt White: Nicola, this is Matt. I'll answer the first one and then Steve will answer the second. So on net debt, yes as stated we ended the quarter at just about $8.1 billion. And what we're doing is adjusting out, it's about $230 million $240 million of PPA] step up. As you can imagine it's not cash. It's not what we repay. It was just a mark to market. So look excluding that we're about $8.1 billion. As discussed in April we had a $3.2 billion out on the squeeze out and the $1.2 billion in on the proceeds. So that would raise net debt holding all else equal to a little bit over $10 billion. Going forward clearly as you've probably seen we're on a path of buybacks. We continue to work on that path. When the $6 billion was approved you may recall it had a 2-year limit on it, so we're working within those confines. So I would see net debt rising throughout the year as we continue to execute the buyback throughout our program. So end of year remains to be seen, it should be something definitely higher than $10 billion, but we're always working to stay within our A/A2 rating which I think we have a lot of room right now. So I would expect net debt to keep rising throughout this year and then into next year to get closer to the A/A2 rating for our final capital structure.
Steve Angell: So regarding your question with respect to Europe, as we look at results and really look at the forecast, I would say within those results Western Europe is weaker. U.K. as you would imagine is fairly weak. Eastern Europe would be the bright spot, I would say on the continent. The growth there is more positive. Going forward we're really preparing for I would say overall weakness. If you -- I'm looking at some statistics here that say that, the beginning of the year forecast for industrial production growth in Germany was 1.6%. Now they're saying negative 1.2% for the year. And Western Europe looks to be flat in terms of industrial production growth. So that is the largely speaking the environment that we have to work inside of. Clearly we're going to be focused on the things we can control as I alluded to earlier which is making sure our pricing is commensurate with the cost inflation that we're seeing, the synergies that we can attain and really a focus on continuous improvement going forward.
Nicola Tang: Thanks. Can I just follow up so the expectations for the weaker second half is it fair to say that's pretty much all driven by Europe as opposed to other regions?
Steve Angell: So that's - I would say Europe is the largest driver. But if I -- if you permit me if I could just make a couple of comments around the world, Latin America I don't expect anything positive going forward. Everyone -- you all know the story. Even though South America is much less of an impact on the new company versus legacy Praxair there's still nothing positive that's going to come out of South America. If I look at Asia, I made a comment about Australia so I think based on my comment you wouldn't expect anything positive to take place in the second half. Everybody wants to know about China. You can include me on that. I don't really have a crystal ball into what's going to happen. I mean just based on what's happened in the last 24 hours you have to be I think cautious with any kind of optimistic forecast in China. I do believe the Chinese government will do whatever they can to try to mitigate the effect of tariffs. But that's pretty much going to be just trying to hold stay in place. If I come back to the Americas -- if I look at the U.S., I think, March was a stronger month than what we had perhaps anticipated which was a positive sign. However, when I look within the numbers merchant liquid volumes seem to be I think at a fairly decent level. We're growing in March -- okay coming into April. But then again I look at our cylinder gas business what we call PDI and those volumes have flattened year-over-year. In fact month -- look at the month of March year-over-year part growth was slightly negative. So I look at that as indicative of what's going on in the overall manufacturing space in the U.S. and I can't look at that and say it's a positive sign. Having said all of that if the economy performs better we'll certainly -- we'll participate in that and we'll be in good shape as Matt said earlier. But I think there are enough signs out there primarily in May, but there are other signs that say we shouldn't be overly optimistic.
Nicola Tang: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much I have a question on the ExxonMobil project. Was that project originally a sale of equipment that was renegotiated into sale of syngas? Or was the contractual structure always the same or roughly the same? And when will that project begin to benefit your income statement?
Steve Angel : Well, I think you can imagine that this project it was going to take a long time to execute. It's coordinated and integral to Exxon's project. So I would expect to see anything until 2023. Now the good news is I'm in pretty good shape starting in 2023 just based on the size of this project. And we have a lot of good projects rolling out with backlog really starting more towards the end of this year rolling forward into 2023. But my understanding of this project has always been on over-the-fence project. It goes back many years in terms of the negotiation and again it's very integrated into their process so it took a long time for something like this to come to fruition.
Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And then do you think gasification is a major growth opportunity for Linde and the industrial gas industry generally? Or do you think it's a minor opportunity?
Steve Angel: I'd like to be able to say that there's a project like this around every corner, but it's not. Just looking at how long it took for this project to come to fruition, I think there may be a few of these like these over the next five years potentially but it's not going to be a major part of our investments or major part of our opportunity slate. Clearly when they happen they're very large, they're very impactful but I do not expect a steady dive to this. And it really comes to I think a question a lot of people ask about this IMO 2020 -- what's going to be the effect. And quite frankly as we have looked at this and studied this most of the major companies and for those who are not familiar with IMO 2020 this is the pre diesel requirement to reduce sulfur particulates to I think it's 0.5%. Most of the major oil companies are going to be investing in cokers. That's what they did in the U.S. There's a lot of coker capacity. That's what ExxonMobil announced in Antwerp. So I think most of IMO 2020 will be addressed by coker capacity. It's a type of asset they're very familiar with, they're comfortable operating. You'll also see certain refiners look to bring a more lighter crude feedstocks. That's the way that they can address IMO 2020. You'll have some refiners who won't do anything. They'll kind of wait and see expecting ships to put on scrubbers and so forth and they'll wait until the end. I think in a few cases, probably in Southeast Asia is where you're going to see the type of solution that we just described with ExxonMobil in Singapore.
Jeff Zekauskas: Okay, great. Thank you so much, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Clark with the Societe Generale. Your line is now open.
Peter Clark: Yes. Thank you. Hi, everyone. Two questions. First of all on the price management there's a lot of emphasis there. Just wondering what sort of things you're emphasizing to the Linde side of the -- that is on the old Linde side of the business. You've got the 2% across the group obviously more in merchant. I mean all air products obviously came up with pretty strong merchant numbers the other day. I'm just wondering what are the sort of things going on there? Then drilling down into the regional margin performance, I'm just wondering if there's -- what the impact of mix is in APAC, because obviously on my numbers Australia is down double-digit again which certainly in Linde used to be a high-margin market maybe not so much for you. And then also in EMEA where I suspect the cylinders being weak are probably an element on the margin drag there. Thank you.
Steve Angell: Okay. So with respect to pricing price management. We have a -- we do things like we just had a workshop where we brought in everybody responsible for price management all over the world. We want to make sure we're exchanging best practices in terms of how we structure contracts, how we think about getting ahead cost inflation, how we do price increases all kinds of things that are very important and really are just part of good overall product management. Some of you may have heard I did a video I did a price management video that was 14 minutes. So that's something that I did and it's something that we track monthly. When we go through our monthly business reviews, we look at price realizations sliced and diced many different ways. With respect to Australia, I would say that it is a business that's of significant size. Part of the problem too is also currency. The Aussie dollar was very weak versus the dollar. But inside of that there are some things going on again more of a secular decline with respect to the industrial side. I think the margins of the business are not bad at all, but we have to look at what we can do to get in front of that. With respect to EMEA I apologize I didn't quite catch your question on EMEA.
Peter Clark: Yes, just in terms of the mix. It's the mix. Obviously, in Asia Pac you were up 140 basis points year-on-year despite Australia being very weak. So I'm just wondering what was behind that. And then in Europe I presume it's the high-margin cylinders that are sort of sluggish and weighing a little bit on the margin there?
Steve Angell: It's more tied to industrial production. The cylinder business is more tied to manufacturing and that would be certainly a factor in those numbers.
Matt White: Yes. And also Peter, you may have seen last year there was a gain in EMEA about of $10 million roughly on the legacy Linde side. Going forward, as you can imagine given the purchase price accounting step up to fair market value, we're not anticipating many gains of any kind of asset actions. So and that also had an influence on the number.
Peter Clark: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Dan Rizzo: This is Dan Rizzo on for Lawrence. How are you?
Steve Angell: Good.
Dan Rizzo: You mentioned a lot of the synergies will be at the end of the year. I was wondering if there's going to be -- if you quantified in what the dissynergies will -- if any will be in the second quarter here and I guess into the third quarter as well?
Matt White: And dissynergies I mean we obviously have costs to achieve the synergies. Those mostly for now those are restructuring costs. We are as you probably saw we had about $89 million total in the first quarter of which roughly $55 million or so actually were just merger expenses that carried over. But the remaining $33 million, $34 million were actually restructuring costs. So we do expect to incur -- that was part of the $700 million that we laid out last quarter that we would need to spend to achieve the synergies. So we'll continue to highlight those costs to track those costs and explain them. Other than those, I wouldn't say that there were any dissynergies that we've identified at this stage.
Dan Rizzo: Okay. Thanks.
Steve Angell: Excuse me, this is Steve. We had the remainder costs in the U.S. that we are addressing. I kind of think of that as a cost synergy opportunity, but you may think of it as a dissynergy. But those are -- that's something we need to address and it's also part why the leverage in the Americas isn't what you would historically expect to see in Q1.
Dan Rizzo: Thank you for the clarification. And then just one other question. You mentioned that if things were to get a little better you could definitely pass the high end of projections. But I was wondering to a certain extent if things were to substantially weaken particularly in the U.S. and I guess Asia based upon what you can achieve with synergies and with what your current contracts, could you still hit the low end of your 2019 projections?
Matt White: Yes.
Dan Rizzo: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Markus Mayer with Baader Helvea. Your line is now open.
Markus Mayer: Good morning. Markus Mayer, Baader Helvea. Three question from my side. First one is again on your guidance. The slight guidance increase maybe you can shed some light was -- from what aspect was this triggered? Was this more synergy aspect or more than better demand or -- yeah that would be helpful. Second question is on the free cash flow. Maybe you can help us to understand how the cash inflow from prepayment at engineering was versus a pro forma number of last year? And then the last question would be, on your tonnage business update on where we stand in terms of plant utilization would be very helpful as we can understand where you are in terms of utilization versus the take-or-pay contract level. Thank you.
Matt White: Yeah, I can take the first two. This is Matt, Markus. So on the guidance, as mentioned we - as Steven mentioned we have a rhythm assumed on what we're going to achieve and how we'll achieve the synergies, so we feel pretty confident about that. And then on top of that, we are assuming some either slowing growth rates or even reductions especially in EMEA. As you know today you are seeing some negative industrial production rates across a lot of key geographies. So the combination of those two are assuming slowing demand but with a rising improvement in our cost management and the self-help. And so at that stage that has led to this outlook. As Steve mentioned, we feel pretty confident that on the bottom end in almost any type scenario at this point, but we also have to be cognizant FX rates can shift and they have been getting worse. So the combination of all this is why we laid it out, but we feel very good about this range. Obviously if levels maintained, we could be at the upper end or better as mentioned. And if we see any improvement that could be highly accretive. So that's how we look at the guidance. On the free cash flow, just on a high level first maybe. So as you probably saw the operating cash flow number about $1.068 billion that's something we are working on. We expect to do better than this. I think when you think about operating cash flow on average both predecessor companies in a full year basis had operating cash flow to EBITDA ratios around mid to high-70s. That's what both companies have consistently demonstrated. And when you look at the first quarter, so that's full year mid to high 70s. First quarter, the average has been about mid-60s. You've had some ups and downs but over the last four or five years both companies averaged about mid-60s being operating cash flow divided by the adjusted EBITDA. This quarter we're mid-50s. Now you may have noticed in the notes that we had about $256 million of merger related cash flow. About $100 million is the one-time payment on the acceleration that we talked about last quarter for the retirement benefits. That's a change in control one-time item. Another $100 million were costs incurred to divest the assets. Again the carryover, the benefit is in investing, which are the proceeds. Unfortunately the way the accounting worked we had to put the $100 million in operating. And then the other $56 million relates mostly to either some merger costs and a little bit of restructuring. So that number when added back we're about mid-60s. So, right now, I feel good about the track, but we do have a lot of one-time cost. And to your specific question on engineering, the line called contract asset and liabilities that was a hurt of about $84 million that isolates what the prepayment trend has been in engineering. So obviously that prepayments are down. There was a lot last year, so that was a bit of a headwind related to the cash flow there. But, this is something that we're working on a lot, and I expect to get these numbers back to the historical levels. But we will have over this first six months of this year a lot of one-time cash merger costs that are still carrying over. Especially in the second quarter, we'll have some large tax out payments. As you may recall, it will be several hundred million dollars of cash taxes we have to pay for the European divestiture. And Steve, can handle I think the tonnage update on -- yes.
Steve Angel: So I don't have I would say information today that I have a lot of confidence in terms of sharing with respect to the reporting. Because keep in mind, we just started migrating our systems and some of this takes a little time. But let me just kind of give you my view. If you talk about merchant liquid capacity, I would say we have capacity in Europe, because we have been growing at a pace that would absorb that capacity. So that's not in tight supply. Same thing would be true in South America. I think if you look at the U.S., it's been around 80% 82% kind of merchant liquid capacity utilization that's LOX and LIN and argon has been much tighter, and of course helium is in hot demand all over the world. There's shortages of helium. If I look at pipeline demands, I would say that hydrogen -- if I look at just the base business in the U.S. Gulf Coast was a little lighter in first quarter. We didn't see the amount of spot hydrogen that we saw last year. That's really driven by Venezuela crude and the shortage of Venezuela crude drives up costs shrinks refinery margins, they didn't run as hard. But I think that will probably sort itself out and get a little stronger as they sort out the crude feedstock issue. With respect to metals pipelines, we operate a lot of -- our on-site business is very strong in the steel pipeline area. And those volumes seem to be doing fine, but it's not end market demand driven. It seems to be more based on import substitution based on the tariffs, and on the fact that inventory levels for steel were quite low, so that needed to be replenished. So that's that story. If I go to Asia, I'm just going to really just make a comment about China. The last number as I looked at said that capacity utilization for merchant liquid was tightening up, which was a good thing. Obviously a lot of capacity come on over the years, so that's a positive. And I think the fact that the pricing, you're hearing a lot more positive regarding price realization in China and it has historically been some of the lowest prices in the world I think would also support the fact that capacity utilization is fairly high there.
Markus Mayer: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Steve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. Steve you had mentioned that roughly 80% of the engineering backlog is external sale of equipment. Can you provide a little more disclosure on what are the types of products those are? How much of it is gases versus non-gases?
Steve Angel: I don't have that breakdown in front of me. I'd say it would be in the current backlog more skewed towards large natural gas plants and olefins, ethane, crackers. There are some large -- there are obviously some A issues and some hydrogen content in there, but I think it's more skewed -- or I know it's more skewed towards natural gas and ethane crackers at this point. And of course, if you look at our gas backlog at $3.5 billion that has two large projects in there today where Linde Engineering is building hydrogen plants for our operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast with two major refineries. So that's part of the internal backlog today. And then, if you go back to the Singapore project that I've mentioned, there's $1.4 billion that will be added to the Selma gas backlog, but then Linde Engineering would be building that.
Steve Byrne: And just a follow-up on that Singapore project. You made a comment that you didn't think there were likely to be too many more like that or just scattered about over the years. Was that a comment specifically about gasifying pitch? And whether you see this as an entrée to gasifying coal and whether you see any change in your outlook for that type of a gasification opportunity for Linde?
Steve Angell: I was really referring more towards a pitch or a vacuum resids kind of gasification approach to address in part what IMO 2020 regulates. That was what I was really referring to and I was not referring to coal gasification to produce intermediate chemicals or whatever in other places of the world usually in China.
Steve Byrne: And your outlook on that opportunity, has that changed?
Steve Angell: For the coal gasification?
Steve Byrne: Coal gasification?
Steve Angell: I don't really -- we talked about this before. We have supplied air separation units in China for coal gasification operations along the coast. That's been part of our density strategy. We take merchant liquids off of those projects and their customers that we feel very comfortable with going forward. So that has been -- the bulk of what we have done it has not been in what they referred to as the coal triangle in China. That just was never part of our strategy. We've also supplied air separation units for Petco gasification for CNOOC and they were taking hydrogen and integrating it back into the refineries. So, those are the kind of projects that we have done in China and I expect we'll see more of those going forward in the future. But anyway that's my answer.
Steve Byrne: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Kevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. I found the adjusted pro forma disclosures in pages 11 to 13 of your release to be very helpful. Was wondering if you intend to provide those results each quarter as we go or if there's a way to understand how 2Q versus 4Q 2018 would have trended in the future SEC filing number one? And then two Praxair in the past provided specific quarterly guidance. You have elected not to do that today but Matt I think you indicated you're expecting moderate improvement. Just curious as to why the change? Is it function of many moving parts in the merger or indicative of how you intend to communicate as a combined company going forward?
Matt White: Hi Kevin, yes, this is Matt. I'll respond to those. I think first to your first question, yes, absolutely we intend to continue to include these. They're necessary. We need to have the ability to explain the walks from the GAAP to the pro forma and then to the adjusted. So, we will continue to add those. I think on the quarterly guidance, that's something we're evaluating and we are looking toward that. As you can imagine, we really have one month in the quarter together. We're just closing the second month. So, things like the monthly rhythm, we're getting better and better, forecasting is a big part of that and we want to improve the forecasting to a more monthly type of rhythm. As we get better at that and we get more confidence on what I'll call short-term outlooks, those are things that we'll incorporate at the top of the house and then make decisions how we communicate those. So, I think you'd hopefully just be patient each quarter. We expect to get better. I mean obviously we have more information here than we had in March 1st. Sequentials will be an area we'll add next quarter. We'll start doing sequentials within 2019. And so that is something that will become another element of this. So, with each step, I expect to get better and better, more transparency. Obviously, we be added the new segments. But as you can imagine the first few quarters, we just got to get the system down of the combined company, get the rhythm to a point that we're more comfortable to continue to disclose these more and more information externally.
Kevin McCarthy: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Jim Sheehan: Good morning. Thank you. How does your EPS guidance translate into an adjusted EBITDA outlook for the year? And specifically what do you expect for D&A in 2019?
Matt White: Hey, James, this is Matt. So, we're not giving an EBITDA outlook. So, I think as you saw -- if you look below the EBIT line starting there I mean, we feel pretty good about our level of interest, right now. We still have a lot of moving capital around the world with the proceeds, with some of the things like the squeeze-out, but we'll see, but we're not giving an EBITDA outlook. I think as far as the adjusted DA, I don't expect a lot of changes in that number other than normal assets coming on and assess coming off. So, if we look at CapEx maybe $3 billion to $3.5 billion in that zone. As projects come on stream, obviously, you'll see CapEx start to step-up and we always have assets coming off. So, I would expect a normal depreciation kind of on an adjusted basis that you would expect, but we're not -- at this point we're not giving an EBITDA outlook.
Jim Sheehan: And under the new segmentation, how should we think about how the cost savings are distributed between these segments?
Steve Angell: Well, I mean, it's -- this is Steve. We have -- I'll go back to what I said our last call. When you look at the $900 million of cost synergies, we said about a third of that is from organizational decentralization and corporate functions and two-thirds of that would be from the regions, both from the standpoint of overlap and in terms of operational efficiencies, procurement, productivity, et cetera. And so, we have those numbers broken down both by corporate and by regions, by functions. And each segment, each geography including Linde Engineering understands what their target is and they all again have developed or are developing very detailed cost and restructuring initiatives to address that. But all the regions are participating. Clearly, there's a lot of overlap in Asia, as I mentioned earlier. But we also have overlap in the Americas. South America is a great example. We have the U.S. RemainCo that we have to integrate in the U.S. We have some operations in Mexico, we have to integrate. And in Europe where there's less integration clearly from -- on the continent we do have integration in the Mideast and Russia that we're working on and that we have other initiatives around costs that we're working as well.
Jim Sheehan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Tyler with Redburn. Your line is now open.
Neil Tyler: Yeah. Good morning. I'd like to go back to the comments you made on pricing and to link that with the margin development in the Americas region year-on-year please. You mentioned that price was able to cover inflation globally. Was that also the case in every region? And the second part of the pricing question is really to follow-up on the comments you made about suspicious gases or helium in particular, and whether that was a meaningful contributor to the overall 2% in any particular region or more broadly and when we think about looking at the pricing numbers that you've disclosed. Thanks.
Steve Angell: Well, let me -- obviously -- I'll just start with the last comment. And I can't say exactly with respect to specialty gas because I haven't seen that number. But clearly helium prices are higher. Helium, I mentioned earlier is a very tight supply around the world, so it is a piece of the 2%. I can't tell you exactly how many basis points, but price increases in the helium are higher -- certainly higher than 2% and need to be just based on the cost inflation as a result of the shortage of helium and the fact that all sourcing contracts have moved up in terms of cost around the world. But we want to make sure -- you're asking me did we cover inflation in every parts of the world and the answer is, no. I mean, there are going to be parts of the world certain product markets that our pricing just like helium is higher than 2%. There are some areas that it's lower and we need to work on that. So, generally speaking, you want to add a minimum as the company makes sure that you're covering your cost of inflation and that's a target that we have always had. There's certainly not a limitation of what the price realization could be. And in terms of driving up operating margins or let's just say variable margins, you really have two ways to do that. It's increasing pricing and its driving productivity and we work both of those levers quite hard. But it's going to be something that it's going to take some time as we -- obviously it's something we spent a lot of time on in Praxair have for many, many years. And it's going to take a little bit more time to get everyone accustomed to what we are trying to do the initiatives that we're rolling out. I think cylinder gas business is something that can be addressed sooner because these are short-term contracts then you have merchant liquid where we have various abilities to address cost pressures and also as those contracts renew and then of course on-site is a longer-term situation.
Matt White: And Neil, this Matt. Just to add two things to Steve. I think, one just in the Americas remember Steve had mentioned this that we did have a bunch of stranded costs from divestco in the first quarter, so those obviously are something we have the ability and time now we're addressing in the second, quarter so that will have an effect on the margin but that's something that we're working on. Secondly on helium, the helium pricing will appear really across all segments because in the other we have the bulk helium or the wholesale helium. So it sells intercompany and then also sells to large global distributors from that other category. So any intercompany transfer pricing increases would show up in other and then end market price increases would show up in the segment. So the way our segments are laid out, helium price increases would be across kind of multiple segments including other.
Neil Tyler: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Matt White: Okay. And I think we have one last question remaining.
Operator: Yes. Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.
Scott Goldstein: Hi, this is Scott Goldstein on for P.J. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on -- amid some of the on-site projects coming online in -- and like Exxon possibly 2023, is there any way that you can help us think about the future earnings contribution from these projects going forward? Thank you.
Steve Angel: Well, this year as I've stated before based on the timing of the projects lot of it's at the end of the year in terms of sales and EPS contributions kind of like 1% in 2019. 2020 as I look at the numbers in 2021 looks to be more like certainly 2% on the sales, maybe 2% to 3% from an EPS contribution standpoint in 2021. And I don't have 2022 in front of me but I would expect at least a 2% and a 2% kind of relationship as well. And then you go forward to 2023, obviously a project like Singapore puts a big dent in those numbers. So I would expect that to be very solid when we -- when that project starts in terms of the overall contribution in sales and EPS.
Scott Goldstein: Okay. Thank you. That’s helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any further remarks.
Juan Pelaez: Chris, thank you again. And thank you everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.
